'##Comparing numbers\n\nWhen we compare numbers, we can use symbols to show if the first number is $\\text{\\blueD{greater than}}$, $\\text{\\greenD{less than}}$, or $\\text{\\purpleD{equal to}}$ the second number.\n\n###Greater than\n\nThe symbol for $\\text{\\blueD{greater than}}$ is $\\blueD>$.\n\n$19$ is $\\text{\\blueD{greater than}}$ $4$.  So, we can use the $\\blueD>$ symbol and write $19\\blueD>4$.\n\n###Less than\n\nThe symbol for $\\text{\\greenD{less than}}$ is $\\greenD<$.\n\n$23$ is $\\text{\\greenD{less than}}$ $80$.  So, we can use the $\\greenD<$ symbol and write $23\\greenD<80$.\n\nOne way to remember the symbols is that the larger, open side of the symbol should always face the greater number.  \n\n###Equal to\n\nThe symbol for $\\text{\\purpleD{equal to}}$ is $\\purpleD=$.\n\n$35$ is $\\text{\\purpleD{equal to}}$ $35$.  So, we can use the $\\purpleD=$ symbol and write $35\\purpleD=35$.\n\n*Want to learn more about comparison symbols?  Check out [this video](/v/greater-than-and-less-than-symbols).*  '
