          <text>Benefits of Open IPO
&#8226;	Open: Access for all, not just the big institutional 
investors 
&#8226; Transparent: Issuer sees the buildup of demand 
by price, and can set the IPO price accordingly
&#8226;	Fair: Allocation of shares to the highest and 
earliest bidders 
&#8226;	Improved Book Building: Incentive to bid early 
and high 
&#8226;	Lower Fees: 4% instead of 7%

          <text>Flipping and spinning
&#8226;	Flipping: Investors that are allocated shares 
in the IPO sell these at the first day of 
trading at a significant profit 
&#8211; A way for investment banks to reward their 
institutional clients? 
&#8226;	Spinning: Underwriters offer shares in hot 
IPOs to executives in companies, whose 
business the bank is looking to attract

          <text>Quiet Period
&#8226;	During the first 25 days after the IPO the firm 
and its underwriters have to remain silent 
about the firm&#8217;s financial prospects 
&#8211; Prevent insiders from &#8220;hyping up&#8221; the price 
&#8226;	After 25 days underwriters release their 
(usually favorable) reports about the firm 
&#8226;	On average stock price rises at the end of the 
quiet period

&#8226;	The underwriter buys the shares from the 
company at a fixed price and immediately 
sells it to investors at the IPO price 
&#8226;	&#8220;Green Shoe&#8221; option: 
&#8226; Clause in the underwriter agreement specifying that 
in case of exceptional public demand the issuer will 
authorize additional shares for distribution by the 
underwriter at the offering price (usual is an over-
allotment option of 15%)

&#8226;	Red Herring: Circulate a preliminary 
prospectus to potential investors 
&#8226;	Road-Show 
&#8226;	Book-building: Collect information about 
the demand from potential investors 
&#8211; &#8220;Firm commitment offerings&#8221;: Investment bank 
commits to sell the shares at the set price

          <text>First day under-pricing 
&#8226;	On average the stock price jumps on the 
first day of trading 
&#8211; From 1990 to 1998 companies left over $27 
billion on the table 
&#8211; The median firm has modest first day return, 
but a few firms have several hundred percent 
&#8226;	This pattern is found in most developed 
capital markets

          <text>&#8220;Hot Issue&#8221; Markets
&#8226;	High average initial IPO returns lead to 
higher volume in the IPO market 
&#8226;	Reasons? 
&#8211; Cycles in the quality and risk composition of 
firms that go public 
&#8211; Correlation in the fund inflow of large money 
managers, but this cannot explain under-pricing

          <text>Why don&#8217;t issuers get upset about 
leaving money on the table?
&#8226;	Issuers believe the reasons their investment 
bankers present to them 
&#8226;	Issuers are very risk averse and want to make sure 
that IPO succeeds 
&#8226;	Since the issuers get rich themselves in the IPO, 
they do not mind the under-pricing 
&#8226;	Some of them do!

backed IPOs
&#8226; VC-backed IPOs show much less under-
performance than non-VC-backed IPOs
&#8211; Relative to their industry benchmarks VC-backed 
IPOs have no under-performance

          <text>The Dual Roles of SCC 
&#8226; Control Mechanism 
&#8594; Entrepreneur has to come back to VC for funding at several points. 
Allows investor to monitor the firm and to shut it down (i.e. not 
fund it) if the success probabilities are poor. 
&#8594;Option to abandon! 
&#8226; Signaling and Screening 
&#8594; Entrepreneurs who are confident about their prospects will want to 
defer raising capital until the firm has passed some milestones.
&#8594; SCC allows the entrepreneur to issue equity at a more favorable 
price and enables VCs to screen among entrepreneurs.

          <text>Anti-Dilution Provisions (cont.) 
&#8226;	Full Ratchet Anti-dilution: The conversion price is lowered to 
the price of the new financing 
&#8226;	Weighted Average Anti-dilution: The new conversion price 
takes into account the num ber of new shares issued 
&#8594; New conversion price = [(A+C)/(A+D)] * old conversion price 
&#8722; A: # of common shares outstanding before transaction 
&#8722; C: # of shares to be issued if old conve rsion pr ice had held 
&#8722; D: # of shares that are actually issued unde r new conve rsion pr ice 
&#8594; New shares to initial investors = (old price/new price)* initial 
shares owned 
&#8594; The more shares are issued (D) at a dilutive price the more the 
weighted ratchet bites

&#8594; Preferred holders vote as if they had converted their holding into 
common shares 
&#8594; Just before they go public: VCs control votes in 57% of deals, 
whereas entrepreneurs control votes in 23% of deals. Neither has 
control in 20% of the deals. 
&#8594; If performance and vesting targets are not met, VC increases 
control in 72% of the cases 
&#8226; Board Representation 
&#8594; Average size of board is 5 
&#8594; VCs get 41.5% of seats on average; entrepreneurs get 34.7 % on

&#8226;	Preferred holders lose anti-dilution pr ovision if they do not 
participate in the next round financing at lower price 
&#8594; Best approach is to require each initial investor to pur chase a 
percentage of the new financing round equal to his pro rata 
ownership among the investor group. The balance of the financing 
will be allocated to new investors. 
&#8594; In current environment: Preferred automatically converts to

          <text>Example: Financing without SCC 
&#8226;	Suppo se company raises $30M all at once, up f ront. 
&#8226;	The entrepreneur will always choose to invest at both stages if 
his next best job is not very good ( even when it is economically 
inefficient) and he&#8217;d have to return the $20M if he didn&#8217;t invest. 
&#8226;	In exchange for $30M, VC will demand 28.5% of the equity, as 
28.5% * (2/3 * 150 + 1/3 * .1 * 1 50)= 30 
&#8226;	Entrepreneur is left with 71.5% of the company.

Example: Financing with SCC 
&#8226; Assume: 
&#8594; Entrepreneur raises $10M now, extra $20M if good news realizes.
&#8594; If bad news comes out, he does not raise money. 
&#8226; Solve backwards: 
&#8594; If good news comes out, sell 13.3% of firm to raise $20M (=
13.3% * 150)
&#8594; In start-up stage, company is worth 2/3 * 150 = 100, sell 10% of 
the company to raise $10M. 
&#8226; The entrepreneur sells only 23.3% of company.  
Note: The initial round i nvestor has to ow n more than 10% of the company initially in anticipation of getting &#8220;diluted&#8221; in 
the subsequent round.  For example, if initially there are 1000 s hares owned by E, first round i nvestor buys 130 
shares (owning 13.4% of company) and second round i nvestor buys 173.9 s hares.

          <text>Why are Discount Rates so High? 
&#8226;	Such high discount rates cannot be explained as being a reward 
for systematic risk. In most cases, CAPM would give discount 
rates well below 25%, let alone 80%. 
&#8226;	Three (limited) &#8220;rationales&#8221;: 
&#8594; Compensate VC for illiquidity of investment 
&#8594; Compensate VC for adding value 
&#8594; VC market power 
&#8594; Should not use high discount rates to correct for overoptimistic  
projections, better build it in cash flow scenarios

&#8226;	Step 1: Calculate Free Cash Flows (FCFs) to an &#8220;all-equity&#8221; firm 
for a period of years until company has reached a &#8220;steady-st ate.&#8221; 
Step 2: Discount these FCFs at the discount rate of an all-equit y 
firm (k). 
&#8226;	Step 3: Calculate a Terminal Value as the present value of a 
growing perpetuity of FCFs assuming some growth rate in FCFs 
and discounti ng by k. 
&#8226;	Step 4: Value tax shields of debt financing separately (trD) and 
discount by a rate that reflects the riskiness of those cash flows. 
&#8226;	Step 5: Steps 1- 4 give you the Enterprise Value. To determine the 
Equity Value subtract the market value of debt.

          <text>The Venture Capital Method 
&#8226;	Step 1 : Forecast sales/revenues to equity for a period of years. 
&#8226;	Step 2 : Estimate the time at which the VC will exit the 
investment (typically through an IPO or sale to strategic buyer). 
&#8226;	Step 3 : Value the exit price based on an assumed multiple of 
earnings or sales or customers, etc. The multiple is typically 
based on comparable public companies or comparable 
transactions. 
&#8226;	Step 4 : Discount interim cash flows and exit value at rates 
ranging from 25% - 80%. 
&#8226;	Step5: Determine the VC&#8217;s stake

          <text>Conclusion: Valuation 
&#8226; The different methods are not mutually exclusive 
&#8226; VC method and comparables are important but 
&#8594; Do not tell you where value comes from 
&#8594; Whether comparables are really comparable 
&#8226; DCF analysis (+ Real options) forces to justify valuation but 
&#8594; Only as good as the data input 
&#8594; Relies on imperfect models 
&#8226; Go back and forth between the two approaches

&#8594; Limited partners have very littl e control over GPs once the money 
has been invested 
&#8594; Large information asymmetries between GPs and LPs

&#8594; Maximize financial returns to justify the risk and effort of the 
investment for their LPs (GP compensation is largly based on

          <text>Most VC contracts have conversion and 
redemption features 
&#8226;	E.g. Convertible preferred can be converted at the shareholders&#8217; 
option into common stock at a pre-specified conversion price 
&#8594; Preferred feature aligns incentives of entrepreneur with VC to 
strive for large payoffs, since it limits returns to the founder for 
modest outcomes. The extent to which the VC wants to encourage 
risk taking by the entrepreneur can be controlled by specific choice 
of security. Redeemable Preferred + Common Stock &gt; 
Participating Convertible Preferred &gt; Convertible Preferred &gt; 
Common Stock &gt; minimum wage 
&#8594; Conversion allows VC to participate in the upside. It also reduces 
VC control once the company is a success, since de facto control 
goes back to management

          <text>Stock Option Pool 
&#8226;	If the firm needs to reserve 15% of the equity (by the exit date) 
t i t t t t h d t d j t t h b 
 to recru it managemen t team, then we nee d to adjust the num ber 
of shares. The VC still gets 38% of the equity. 
&#8226;	If m is the stock option pool percentage, and Nm is the number 
of shares issued to the stock opt ion pool, then we know that the 
shares issued to the VC and the option pool (N1+ Nm) are: 
s + m N 01 &#8722; s &#8722; m 
&#8226;	The shares held by the VC investor, N1, are then: 
s N 1 &#8722; s &#8722; m 0 
Stock Option Pool (cont.) 
&#8226;	Thus in our exam pple: 
&#8594; N1 = 0.38/(1 - 0.38 - 0.15) * 1M = 0.809M shares 
&#8594; Nm = 0.15/(1 - 0.38 - 0.15) *1M = 0.319M shares. 
&#8594;Price per share is $6.18.

          <text>Notable Features of this Valuation 
&#8226;	Tax Losses. No taxes until year 5; use accumulated net tax 
losses from pprevious yyears to offset taxable income in yyear 5. 
&#8226;	Equity Value . In general we subtract a measure of the market 
value of debt (MVD) at the time of the initial valuation to get equity 
value. Here it is zero; so enterprise value equals equity value. 
&#8226;	Terminal Values and Growth Rates. Note that we have assumed 
relatively slow terminal value gr owth rates: 3% or 7%. Still, the 
value of the business in the second case is nearly twice that of the 
first case. Most of the value of this firm comes from the terminal 
value!! 
&#8594; Model cash flows explicitly unt il the firms is in steady state 
&#8594; This may be reasonable if there is IP protecting profits or 
barriers to entry, but we need to be careful 
The Venture Capital Method 
The Standard calculations: 
&#8226;	Step 1 : Forecast sales or earnings for a period of years Step 1: Forecast sales or earnings for a period of years . 
&#8226;	Step 2: Estimate the time at which the VC will exit the 
investment (typically through an IP O or sale to strategic buyer). 
&#8226;	Step 3: Value the exit price based on an assumed multiple of 
earnings or sales or customers, et c. The multiple is typically 
based on comparable public companies or comparable 
transactions.

          <text>Rationale I: Investments Are Illiquid 
&#8226;	Investments in a private companies cannot be soldInvestments in a private companies cannot be sold 
as easily as stock in public companies. 
&#8594; All else equal, this lack of marketability makes private equity 
investments less valuable than easily-traded public investments. 
&#8226;	Caveat: How much less valuable? 
&#8594; Practitioners in private equity in vestments often use liquidity 
discounts of 20%-30%, i.e., they estimate the value to be 20% to 30% less than an equivalent stake in a publicly traded company. 
Rationale II: VC Adds Value 
&#8226;	VCs are active investors and brin gg more to the deal 
than just money: 
&#8594; spend a large amount of time, 
&#8594; reputation capital, 
&#8594; access to skilled managers, 
&#8594; industry contacts, network, 
&#8594; and other resources. 
&#8226;	AlA large d i discoun tt ratte iis a cru dde way tto compensa tte 
the VC for this investment of time and resources. 
&#8226;	Caveat: Why not compensate the VC explicitly for 
services?

          <text>Caveats About Multiples 
&#8226;	Industry Cycles 
&#8594;&#8594; Young industries might have high multiples for firms that enterYoung industries might have high multiples for firms that enter 
the market today, since they  have first mover advantage 
&#8226;	Mean Reversion 
&#8594; High multiples for firms that ent er the market during a &#8220;hot&#8221; 
market need not apply for firms that go public in a few years 
&#8594; How well can you &#8220;market time&#8221;? 
&#8226;	Vesting Period 
&#8594; IPO multiples overstate gains due to long term under- 
performance 
&#8594; Choose your multiples wisely!! 
Why Are Discount Rates so High? 
&#8226;	Such high discount rates cannot be explained asSuch high discount rates cannot be explained as 
being a reward for systematic risk. 
&#8226;	In most practical cases, CAPM would give discount 
rates well below 25%, let alone 80%. 
&#8226;	ThThree (li(limit ited)d) &#8220; &#8220;ratitionalles&#8221;&#8221;:

          <text>Rationale III: Optimistic Forecasts 
&#8226;	VC method assumes that the firm hits its targetsVC method assumes that the firm hits its targets . 
&#8594; Forecasts tend to rely on cash flows in the best case 
&#8226;	A higher discount rate is  a crude way to correct 
forecasts that are too optimistic . 
&#8226;	CCavea tt: 
&#8594; Build uncertainty into the cash flow estimates 
&#8594; 80% of 0 is still 0 
&#8594; This is not the time to be lazy! 
Rationale IV: VC Market Power 
&#8226;	Valuations are influenced by the distribution ofValuations are influenced by the distribution of 
bargaining power betw een VC and entrepreneur 
&#8594; Affects the rent distribut ion between VC and entrepreneur 
&#8226;	Factors that influence bargaining power: 
&#8594; Supply and demand for capital; when a lot of capital flows 
into the VC market ,,  valuations are hi ggher 
&#8594; Valuations increase with the number of active VC firms in the market 
&#8594; Reputation and track record of VC / entrepreneur; repeat entrepreneurs get better valuations

          <text>APV Approach for New Ventures 
&#8226;	The Standard APV Calculations: 
&#8226;	Stepp 1: Calculate Free Cash Flows ((FCFs )) to an &#8220;all-e qqyuity&#8221; firm 
for a period of years until com pany reached a &#8220;steady-state.&#8221; 
&#8226;	Step 2: Discount these FCFs at the discount rate of an all-
equity firm (k). 
&#8226;	Step 3: Calculate a Terminal Value as the present value of a 
growing perpetuity of FCFs assuming some growth rate in FCFs 
and discounting by k. 
&#8226;	Step 4: 4: Value tax shields of debt financing separately (trD) and Value tax shields of debt financing separately (trD) and Step 
discount by a rate that reflects t he riskiness of those cash flows. 
&#8226;	Step 5: Steps 1-4 give you the Enterprise Value. To determine 
the Equity Value subtract the ma rket value of debt (the present 
value of interest payments). 
Cost of Capital for All-Equity Firm (k) 
k = risk-free rate + &#946; * market risk premium 
&#8594;Risk-free rate = Long-term bond rate 
&#8594;beta = &#8220;unlevered&#8221; beta of comparable firms in 
the industry 
&#8594;&#946;U= &#946;L* Eco/ [Eco+ Dco] 
&#8594;Market risk premium = 7%

New Investor (cont.) 
&#8226;	Note that the first round VC investor starts off with a 40.7% e quityqy 
stake, which then gets diluted to 38% ownership when the second 
round VC investor comes on board. 
&#8226;	If development time slips by two years then the second round 
investors require 11.1% equity share,  since their valuation at this 
point is $26.9M = 100/1.35. If we still have to give 15% in option 
pool, this implies that: 
N 22 = 1 &#8722; ss 
22 
&#8722; m (( N 00 + N 11)) 
which is (0.111/(1 - 0.111 - 0.15))*1.940M = 0.291M shares. 
&#8226;	The first-round VC ends up with onl y 35.8% of the shares at the 
exit date and the IRR on the invest ment falls to 32.5% from 50%. 
Comparable Multiples For Exit Values 
&#8226;	Find exit values by looking at similar companiesFind exit values by looking at similar companies 
&#8594; Take multiples of EBITDA, sales, customers, eyeballs etc.

&#8594; May be hard to find real comparable firms at similar stages that

          <text>Why this Approach is Problematic 
&#8226; Ignoring the liquidation value has two implications: 
&#8594; Because investors get 100% of the firm in liquidation, if the firm 
has value in liquidation, they need less equity upon conversion to 
compensate them for their initial investment. 
&#8594; Because investors get 100% of the firm in liquidation, the implied 
pre-and post-money valuation that is offered to the entrepreneur is 
overstated!

          <text>Relation of Deal Structure and Implied 
Firm Value: Convertible Preferred 
&#8226;	VCs typically derive the &#8220;post-money&#8221; (&#8220;pre-money&#8221;) value of 
a firm based on the terms of the convertible preferred contract.  
&#8594; If, for example, the VC invests $2M in the above convertible 
preferred contract (which converts into 40% of the firm&#8217;s common 
stock), then VC will say that the post-money value is $2M/.4 = 
$5M and the pre-money value is $3M ($5M -$2M) 
&#8594; Alternatively, if the VC method comes up with a value of $5M 
post-money, and the investment is $2M , then the VC method 
chooses a % ownership, s, such that s*$5M = $2M. Here s is 40%.

          <text>Backing Out V* Using Option Pricing 
&#8226;	We know that if the VC is getting a market return: 
$2M = Value of Option (A) + Value of Option (B).
&#8226;	If we know the risk-free rate (rf) and the strike prices (FV and 
CV), and take a guess at the maturity (T) and the volatility of 
the investment (&#963;). The only thing we don&#8217;t know is V*. All we 
need to do i s reverse engineer the Black Scholes formula. 
&#8226;	Thus, suppose rf=5%, FV=2, CV=5, T=3, and &#963;=50%.  What

          <text>Evolution of Preferred Stock Over Time 
&#8226; 1970s: Security of choice -Redeemable preferred 
&#8594; Often in combination with common stock 
&#8594; Not many IPOs 
&#8226; 1980s: Security of choice -Convertible preferred 
&#8594; Active IPO market 
&#8594; Large increase of funds flowing into VC industry 
&#8226; 1990s: Security of choice -Participating conve rtible preferred 
&#8594; Many later stage investors paid very high prices

&#8226;	Mandatory redemption right allows VC to &#8220;put&#8221; the preferred 
stock back to the company 
&#8594; Force liquidity event 
&#8594; Prevent &#8220;life-style company&#8221; 
&#8594; Specified in &gt; 90% of VC deals 
&#8226;	Redeemable preferred stock always specifies when it must be 
redeemed by company 
&#8594; Typically the sooner of IPO or 5 to 8 y ears: company has to pay 
cash to redeem preferred at original price or &#8220;fair market value&#8221; 
&#8226;	If company cannot redeem, then penalties can kick in: 
&#8594;Reduction in conversion price or increased board seats for VC

          <text>The Role of Preferred Stock 
&#8226;	Preferred feature aligns incentives of entrepreneur with VC to 
strive for large payoffs 
&#8594; Limits returns to the founde r for modest outcomes -incentives to 
reach high payoffs 
&#8226;	The extent to which the VC wants to encourage the entrepreneur 
to go for the big payoffs can be controlled by specific choice of 
security. Redeemable Preferred + Common Stock &gt;

          <text>Why these Concerns are Important 
&#8226;	The approach ignores the value of the dow nside protection 
provided by the preferred feature of the security. 
&#8226;	This affects the implied value that the VC offers: 
Number of Cost Value Avg. % 
Investments Value/Cost 
Write-Offs 172 395 40 10.1% 
Below Cost 221 596 225 37.8%

Over 10x 76 206 3703 1797.6% 
Total 1004 2790 8927 320.0% 
&#8226;	If firm is liquidated below cost, average recovery is 26.8%  of 
cost; if liquidated at or below cost average recovery is 38.4 %.

          <text>Convertible Terms 
&#8226; Conversion option: 
&#8594; If initial investment is $2,000,000 and conversion price is $5/sh, 
then can convert into 400,000 shares. If there are initially 600 ,000 
common shares outstanding, then own 40% of the common stock 
on conversion. 
&#8594; In this case, will conve rt if .4*V&gt;$2M or V&gt;$5M (ignoring 
accrued dividends). 
&#8226; Automatic Conversion 
&#8594; VC must convert at an IPO provided the IPO price is greater than 
some multiple of the initial conversion price. 
&#8594; The median multiple is 3.0; it is higher for early stage deals (4.0); 
lower for later stage deals (2.7)

          <text>An Example to Make the Point 
&#8226;	Assume the VC invest $2M . And va lue of the firm at IPO is V* with 
probability 0.5 and is liquidity for V=$1M with probability 0.5. What 
is the implied value V* the VC is offering based on the deal terms of a 
convertible preferred contract? 
&#8226;	In order for the VC to earn a market return on her investment: 
$2M = 0.5*40%*V* + 0.5*100% *$1M , 
&#61672; The implied value V* is $7.5M. 
&#8226;	In contrast, to break even under common stock we would need: 
$2M = 0.5*40%*V + 0.5*40%*$1M 
&#61672; The implied value is $9M

          <text>Liquidation Preference over Common Stock
&#8226; Prevents the &#8220;Take-the-Money-and-Run&#8221; Problem 
&#8594; Prevents founders from being able to pull out money before they 
create any real value 
&#8226; Tax Deferral 
&#8594; Redemption of preferred is just return of capital, thus no capital 
gains tax 
&#8226; Favorable Pricing of Common Stock 
&#8594; IRS will accept low common-stock valuations and thus will not put 
heavy tax burden on employees/founder with common stock.

Scholes? 
&#8226;	As long as we know the volatility of the underlying value, the 
interest rate, the time horizon, and today&#8217;s market value, we&#8217;re 
all set.

          <text>Valuing Options with Tracking Portfolios: 
The Binomial Method 
&#8226; Replicate cash flows of call option with common stock and debt 
&#8594; Up-node: a * (u * S0) + b * Rf= CU 
&#8594; Down-node: a * (d * S0) + b * Rf = CD 
&#8226; Tracking portfolio: 
&#8594; a = (CU -CD) / [(u-d)*S0] (hedge ratio, delta) 
&#8594; b = (u*CD -d*CU) / [(u-d)*Rf] (amount borrowed) 
&#8226; Current value of the option is therefore: 
&#8594; C0 = (a * S0 + b) 
= {[(Rf -d)/(u-d)]*Cu + [(u- Rf)/(u-d)]*Cd}/Rf

          <text>How to Get Variables for Option Pricing 
&#8226; Use DCF valuation analysis to get present value 
&#8226; Use scenario analysis to get volatility of present value 
&#8594; Need to make assumptions about probabilities of various 
outcomes 
&#8594; Need to make assumptions about the cash flows under 
different scenarios 
&#8594; If you have volatility of comparable company you might be 
able to use these. But rarely available

          <text>What not to do 
&#8226;	Don&#8217;t use options opportunistically: Sometimes people use real 
options as ex post justificati on of bad investment decisions! 
&#8226;	&#8220;This business may look bad, but it gives us options to get into 
better businesses.&#8221; 
&#8594; A bad project is still a bad proj ect. Avoid it if you can!

          <text>Spotting the Real Option 
&#8226;	If in the first year of the Chic ago market, you learn that you can 
only get 15% markups, not 25% ma rkups, then it is not optimal 
to enter the other markets. 
&#8594; Spotting the real option potential here means staging the 
entry into the local markets.

          <slideno>20</slideno>
          <text>What to Do 
&#8226;	It is important to spot the opti on and to get some rough sense of its 
value. 
&#8226;	Understand what is the critical part of the existing project that 
generates the real option 
&#8594; Real options have to be embedded in the first step, otherwise  you 
do not need the first part. Then it is  not a real option anymore but 
an opportunity! 
&#8226;	Be careful when pricing real options with the Black &amp; Scholes formula 
&#8594;	Volatility of underlying project is difficult to estimate 
&#8594;	Misestimating the volatility of an opt ion can severely affect its value

          <text>No Way! 
&#8226;	Analogy between financial and real options is less than perfect. 
&#8226;	To apply financial options pricing methodology to real options 
and understand its strengths and weaknesses, we need to 
review the underlying assumptions and mechanics.

          <text>Example: Option to Enter New Markets 
&#8226;	Consider the strategy of Focal Communications, a Competitive 
Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) circa 1996. 
&#8226;	Could choose to enter all local markets simultaneously or could 
enter local markets sequentially. 
&#8226;	Advantage of Sequential Entry: You get to see how valuable it is 
to be a CLEC before deciding whether to enter more markets. 
&#8594; New information is obtained by entering the first market, and 
management adjusts its strategy in response.

          <text>Risk Neutral Valuation Method 
&#8226;	Option values from the binomial method are equivalent to 
assuming that investors are risk neutral and earn the risk free 
rate of return on all investments. 
&#8226;	Under this assumption, the return on the stock must satisfy: 
&#8594; S0 * Rf = &#960; * (u * S0) + (1 -&#960;) * (d * S0) 
&#8594;	&#960; = (Rf -d) / (u-d), 
where we can think of &#960; as the &#8220;risk-neutral probability&#8221; of an 
up-movement in the stock. 
&#8226;	Calculate current value of option 
&#8594; C0 = (&#960; * CU + (1 -&#960;) * CD)/Rf

          <text>Decision Analytic Approach 
&#8226; Investors are not passive : 
&#8594; If markups turns out to be only 15%, then they will not enter 
the other markets and the payoff at this point is zero.  
Payoffs in two years are: 
.5 13.7*9 = 123 
50
.5 0
(-5.9*0.5 + 13.7*0.5) +  0.5*(9*13.7)/1.162 = 50

          <text>Decision Analysis vs. Option Pricing 
&#8226;	The Option Pricing Method gives a higher valuation than the 
Decision Analysis Method (65 vs. 50). 
&#8226;	Note that you need the same info rmation to price the options 
using both methods. 
&#8226;	Both methods have their drawbacks 
&#8594; The Option Pricing Method assumes that there is arbitrage 
when there clearly isn&#8217;t 
&#8594; The Decision Analysis Method discounts payoffs using 
CAPM-based discount rates which assume that payoffs are 
linear.

&#8226;	Suppose the key source of uncerta inty is the markup of price 
over carrier settlements. 
&#8226;	Suppose that there is a 50% c hance that the mark up is high 
(25% mark up) and a 50% chance t hat it is low (15% mark up). 
&#8226;	Assume the expected value of entering a market is $13.9 million 
if the mark up is high and -$5.9 million if the mark up is low 
&#8226;	The firm can enter 10 markets 
&#8226;	How would you model this uncertainty?

&#8226; Find risk neutral probabilities 
&#8594; Market value of project is 39.0. This is the discounted value 
of the expected payoffs in the low and and high markup 
states assuming a probability of 0.5 for each state and a 
16% discount rate. 
&#8594; The risk-neutral probabilities are given by:
&#960; * (137.0) + (1 - &#960;) * (-59.0) = 39.0 * (1.07)2
&#8594; So, &#960; = 0.54 
&#8226; Present value of the Focal option: 
&#8594; PV= (0.54 * 137.0 + 0.46*0) / (1.07)2 = 65.6
