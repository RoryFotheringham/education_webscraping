 Criteria: 
 Valuation! (bait and switch) 
 Reputation of the analyst covering the firm 
 Performance of past IPOs 
 Not a criteria: fees! (7% of capital raised) 
 After market trading support, trading history 
 Hi-Tech IPOs are often underwritten by a consortium

          <text>Flipping and spinning
	Flipping: Investors that are allocated shares 
in the IPO sell these at the first day of 
trading at a significant profit 
 A way for investment banks to reward their 
institutional clients? 
	Spinning: Underwriters offer shares in hot 
IPOs to executives in companies, whose 
business the bank is looking to attract

          <text>Why dont issuers get upset about 
leaving money on the table?
	Issuers believe the reasons their investment 
bankers present to them 
	Issuers are very risk averse and want to make sure 
that IPO succeeds 
	Since the issuers get rich themselves in the IPO, 
they do not mind the under-pricing 
	Some of them do!

 Clientele effects: Only optimistic investors 
buy into an IPO, but believes converge when 
more information is released about the firm
 Window of opportunity: Valuations of IPOs 
is subject to fads so issues try to go public in 
hot markets

          <text>Quiet Period
	During the first 25 days after the IPO the firm 
and its underwriters have to remain silent 
about the firms financial prospects 
 Prevent insiders from hyping up the price 
	After 25 days underwriters release their 
(usually favorable) reports about the firm 
	On average stock price rises at the end of the 
quiet period

          <text>Caveats About Multiples 
	Industry Cycles 
 Young industries might have high multiples for firms that enterYoung industries might have high multiples for firms that enter 
the market today, since they  have first mover advantage 
	Mean Reversion 
 High multiples for firms that ent er the market during a hot 
market need not apply for firms that go public in a few years 
 How well can you market time? 
	Vesting Period 
 IPO multiples overstate gains due to long term under- 
performance 
 Choose your multiples wisely!! 
Why Are Discount Rates so High? 
	Such high discount rates cannot be explained asSuch high discount rates cannot be explained as 
being a reward for systematic risk. 
	In most practical cases, CAPM would give discount 
rates well below 25%, let alone 80%.

          <text>Rationale I: Investments Are Illiquid 
	Investments in a private companies cannot be soldInvestments in a private companies cannot be sold 
as easily as stock in public companies. 
 All else equal, this lack of marketability makes private equity 
investments less valuable than easily-traded public investments. 
	Caveat: How much less valuable? 
 Practitioners in private equity in vestments often use liquidity 
discounts of 20%-30%, i.e., they estimate the value to be 20% to 30% less than an equivalent stake in a publicly traded company. 
Rationale II: VC Adds Value 
	VCs are active investors and brin gg more to the deal 
than just money: 
 spend a large amount of time, 
 reputation capital, 
 access to skilled managers, 
 industry contacts, network, 
 and other resources.

          <text>Notable Features of this Valuation 
	Tax Losses. No taxes until year 5; use accumulated net tax 
losses from pprevious yyears to offset taxable income in yyear 5. 
	Equity Value . In general we subtract a measure of the market 
value of debt (MVD) at the time of the initial valuation to get equity 
value. Here it is zero; so enterprise value equals equity value. 
	Terminal Values and Growth Rates. Note that we have assumed 
relatively slow terminal value gr owth rates: 3% or 7%. Still, the 
value of the business in the second case is nearly twice that of the 
first case. Most of the value of this firm comes from the terminal 
value!! 
 Model cash flows explicitly unt il the firms is in steady state 
 This may be reasonable if there is IP protecting profits or 
barriers to entry, but we need to be careful 
The Venture Capital Method 
The Standard calculations: 
	Step 1 : Forecast sales or earnings for a period of years Step 1: Forecast sales or earnings for a period of years . 
	Step 2: Estimate the time at which the VC will exit the 
investment (typically through an IP O or sale to strategic buyer). 
	Step 3: Value the exit price based on an assumed multiple of 
earnings or sales or customers, et c. The multiple is typically 
based on comparable public companies or comparable 
transactions.

	If the firm needs to reserve 15% of the equity (by the exit date) 
t i t t t t h d t d j t t h b 
 to recru it managemen t team, then we nee d to adjust the num ber 
of shares. The VC still gets 38% of the equity. 
	If m is the stock option pool percentage, and Nm is the number 
of shares issued to the stock opt ion pool, then we know that the 
shares issued to the VC and the option pool (N1+ Nm) are: 
s + m N 01  s  m 
	The shares held by the VC investor, N1, are then:

	Thus in our exam pple: 
 N1 = 0.38/(1 - 0.38 - 0.15) * 1M = 0.809M shares 
 Nm = 0.15/(1 - 0.38 - 0.15) *1M = 0.319M shares.

          <text>APV Approach for New Ventures 
	The Standard APV Calculations: 
	Stepp 1: Calculate Free Cash Flows ((FCFs )) to an all-e qqyuity firm 
for a period of years until com pany reached a steady-state. 
	Step 2: Discount these FCFs at the discount rate of an all-
equity firm (k). 
	Step 3: Calculate a Terminal Value as the present value of a 
growing perpetuity of FCFs assuming some growth rate in FCFs 
and discounting by k. 
	Step 4: 4: Value tax shields of debt financing separately (trD) and Value tax shields of debt financing separately (trD) and Step 
discount by a rate that reflects t he riskiness of those cash flows. 
	Step 5: Steps 1-4 give you the Enterprise Value. To determine 
the Equity Value subtract the ma rket value of debt (the present 
value of interest payments). 
Cost of Capital for All-Equity Firm (k) 
k = risk-free rate +  * market risk premium 
Risk-free rate = Long-term bond rate 
beta = unlevered beta of comparable firms in 
the industry 
U= L* Eco/ [Eco+ Dco] 
Market risk premium = 7%

	Company may not have taxable income for many years. 
 Tax rate in these yyears is 0. Tax losses can be carried forward 
for up to 15 years to lower taxable income in profitable years. 
 What discount rate should be applied? 
	Interest expense is not deductible in years when the 
company has tax losses. 
 Carry forward interest expense to years when it can be 
deducted (up to three years carry forward). 
	Explicit modeling of idiosyncratic uncertainty isExplicit modeling of idiosyncratic uncertainty is 
particularly important.

New Investor (cont.) 
	Note that the first round VC investor starts off with a 40.7% e quityqy 
stake, which then gets diluted to 38% ownership when the second 
round VC investor comes on board. 
	If development time slips by two years then the second round 
investors require 11.1% equity share,  since their valuation at this 
point is $26.9M = 100/1.35. If we still have to give 15% in option 
pool, this implies that: 
N 22 = 1  ss 
22 
 m (( N 00 + N 11)) 
which is (0.111/(1 - 0.111 - 0.15))*1.940M = 0.291M shares. 
	The first-round VC ends up with onl y 35.8% of the shares at the 
exit date and the IRR on the invest ment falls to 32.5% from 50%. 
Comparable Multiples For Exit Values

	Clearly label your calculations and spell out any assumptions 
that are non-obvious 
	Write short and price answers, no need for long 
 Do not fish around for an answer

          <text>APV Approach for New Ventures 
	The Standard APV Calculations 
	Step 1: Calculate Free Cash Flows (FCFs) to an all-equity firm 
for a period of years until company has reached a steady-st ate. 
Step 2: Discount these FCFs at the discount rate of an all-equit y 
firm (k). 
	Step 3: Calculate a Terminal Value as the present value of a 
growing perpetuity of FCFs assuming some growth rate in FCFs 
and discounti ng by k. 
	Step 4: Value tax shields of debt financing separately (trD) and 
discount by a rate that reflects the riskiness of those cash flows. 
	Step 5: Steps 1- 4 give you the Enterprise Value. To determine the 
Equity Value subtract the market value of debt.

          <text>Structure of compensation 
	Base compensation as a % of committed capital (or assets under 
management) plus carried interest 
 Management fee: 1.5% -2.5% of capital 
 Carried interest : 20% share of profits 
	Positive: 
 Induces effort 
 Attracts talented individuals (really?) 
	Negative: 
 Huge incentives and potential for opportunism: 
 Increasing fund size 
 Changing deal mix

          <text>Discounted cash flow method (APV)
 Economics of business 
Where does positive NPV come from? 
Most important 
Cash flows 
Free cash flow to all equity invest ment = 
EBIT * ( 1 - t ) + DEPR - CAPX - NWC 
 Discount rate 
Economics + Cash Flows + Rate  = VALUE

          <text>Strengths and weaknesses of methods 
APV 
 Strengths 
Model cash flows as coming from specific set of operating 
strategies / assumptions 
Can see impact of changes in strategies on valuation 
Valuation tied to fundamentals 
 Weaknesses 
Difficult to know right market risk premium and risk factor 
May leave things out? 
Strategic value?</text>

          <slideno>7</slideno>
          <text>Why are Discount Rates so High? 
	Such high discount rates cannot be explained as being a reward 
for systematic risk. In most cases, CAPM would give discount 
rates well below 25%, let alone 80%. 
	Three (limited) rationales: 
 Compensate VC for illiquidity of investment 
 Compensate VC for adding value 
 VC market power 
 Should not use high discount rates to correct for overoptimistic  
projections, better build it in cash flow scenarios

 An individual effort 
 Open book: Use any materials from course 
 Do not bring in outside historical or industry info 
 Final has all the informati on you need  its made up anyway!! 
 You can use excel for valuation purpose 
But do not blame me if your laptop crashes! 
 What you cannot use: 
 Mobile devices, Ipad, Pda etc. 
 Your neighbors brains

          <text>Conclusion: Valuation 
 The different methods are not mutually exclusive 
 VC method and comparables are important but 
 Do not tell you where value comes from 
 Whether comparables are really comparable 
 DCF analysis (+ Real options) forces to justify valuation but 
 Only as good as the data input 
 Relies on imperfect models 
 Go back and forth between the two approaches

          <text>The Venture Capital Method 
	Step 1 : Forecast sales/revenues to equity for a period of years. 
	Step 2 : Estimate the time at which the VC will exit the 
investment (typically through an IPO or sale to strategic buyer). 
	Step 3 : Value the exit price based on an assumed multiple of 
earnings or sales or customers, etc. The multiple is typically 
based on comparable public companies or comparable 
transactions. 
	Step 4 : Discount interim cash flows and exit value at rates 
ranging from 25% - 80%. 
	Step5: Determine the VCs stake

          <text>Most VC contracts have conversion and 
redemption features 
	E.g. Convertible preferred can be converted at the shareholders 
option into common stock at a pre-specified conversion price 
 Preferred feature aligns incentives of entrepreneur with VC to 
strive for large payoffs, since it limits returns to the founder for 
modest outcomes. The extent to which the VC wants to encourage 
risk taking by the entrepreneur can be controlled by specific choice 
of security. Redeemable Preferred + Common Stock &gt; 
Participating Convertible Preferred &gt; Convertible Preferred &gt; 
Common Stock &gt; minimum wage 
 Conversion allows VC to participate in the upside. It also reduces 
VC control once the company is a success, since de facto control 
goes back to management

          <text>Logic behind the term sheet is to mitigate 
potential conflicts between the two parties
 Financial returns divided to: 
 Reward investors for their investments in the firm 
 Provide high-powered incentives to entrepreneurs to maximize 
value and stay with the firm 
 Provide VCs with incentives to add value 
 Dynamic allocation of control: 
 Gives more control to entrepreneur if things turn out well 
 Gives more control to VC if things do not turn out well 
 Provides incentives to achieve a liquidity event 
 Prevents entrepreneur from settling for life-style firm

          <text>Venture Capitalist as Intermediaries 
 VC himself faces agency issues with regard to his LPs 
 Limited partners have very littl e control over GPs once the money 
has been invested 
 Large information asymmetries between GPs and LPs 
 VCs objectives: 
 Maximize financial returns to justify the risk and effort of the 
investment for their LPs (GP compensation is largly based on 
carried interest) 
 Building own reputation to facilitate fundraising for later funds and 
improve deal flow 
 Eventually achieve liquidit y, since fund has limited lifetime

          <text>The Dual Roles of SCC 
 Control Mechanism 
 Entrepreneur has to come back to VC for funding at several points. 
Allows investor to monitor the firm and to shut it down (i.e. not 
fund it) if the success probabilities are poor. 
Option to abandon! 
 Signaling and Screening 
 Entrepreneurs who are confident about their prospects will want to 
defer raising capital until the firm has passed some milestones.
 SCC allows the entrepreneur to issue equity at a more favorable 
price and enables VCs to screen among entrepreneurs.

          <text>Anti-Dilution Provisions (cont.) 
Pay to Play Provision 
	Preferred holders lose anti-dilution pr ovision if they do not 
participate in the next round financing at lower price 
 Best approach is to require each initial investor to pur chase a 
percentage of the new financing round equal to his pro rata 
ownership among the investor group. The balance of the financing 
will be allocated to new investors. 
 In current environment: Preferred automatically converts to 
common if investors do not participate in dilutive financing

          <text>Example: SCC as a Control Mechanism 
	Mit.com needs: 
 $10M to get things off the ground 
 $20M a year from now for further development of the business.
	Next year, news about firms prospects will have come out: 
 Good news (2/3 prob.): Certain success =&gt; $150M payoffs 
 Bad news (1/3 prob.): 1/10 chance of success ($150M payoff) and 
a 9/10 chance of failure ($0 payoff). 
	If bad news comes out, efficient not to invest $20M to get 
expected payoff of $15M .

          <text>Registration Rights 
	Stipulate the extent to which preferred versus common stock 
will share equal/preferential treatment when the stocks have 
been converted and participate in an IPO 
	Demand Rights: Allow investors to demand that the company 
goes public even if management does not want to 
	Piggy-back Rights: Allow investor to include his shares 
along side with company in an IPO 
	Lock-up Provision: Specifies the period unt il shares vest

          <text>Anti-Dilution Provisions (cont.) 
	Full Ratchet Anti-dilution: The conversion price is lowered to 
the price of the new financing 
	Weighted Average Anti-dilution: The new conversion price 
takes into account the num ber of new shares issued 
 New conversion price = [(A+C)/(A+D)] * old conversion price 
 A: # of common shares outstanding before transaction 
 C: # of shares to be issued if old conve rsion pr ice had held 
 D: # of shares that are actually issued unde r new conve rsion pr ice 
 New shares to initial investors = (old price/new price)* initial 
shares owned 
 The more shares are issued (D) at a dilutive price the more the 
weighted ratchet bites

deals, some aspect of the contract is contingent on financial or 
non-financial performance measures 
Voting control to VC if EBIT below some threshold 
Share vesting contingent on FDA approval 
Earn-ins: Earn equity by meeting va lue goals

Example: 
Company ha s 2 M shares outstanding 
1M common stock to founde rs 
1M conve rtible preferred to investors, conve rsion pr ice $1
New issue of 50,000 shares at $0.5 0, raise $25,000 
Full ratchet: 
 New conversion price: $0.50 
 Convertible preferred holders now get 2M shares or 65.6% of equity 
Weighted average ratchet: 
 New conversion price = (2M + 25,0 00)/(2M + 50,000)* $1= 0.988
 Preferred stock holders get 1,012,146 shares or 49.08% of equity

          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>Anti-Dilution Provisions 
	If the firm raises additional funding at a price below the prior 
round V Cs price, the VCs conversion pr ice is lowered to 
protect against dilution. 
	Anti-Dilution protection comes out of founde rs shares or earlier 
round i nvestor, if these are not protected against dilution 
 Prevents company from strategically raising later rounds to
expropriate investors (avoid wash out  financing)
 Helps to maintain constant fraction of equity --control rights 
 Company and founde rs bear most of the risk 
Incentive for founders to create value 
Golden rule: Those that have the gold make the rules.

control in 20% of the deals. 
 If performance and vesting targets are not met, VC increases 
control in 72% of the cases 
 Board Representation 
 Average size of board is 5 
 VCs get 41.5% of seats on average; entrepreneurs get 34.7 % on 
average; outsiders the remainder. 8</text>

          <text>Example: Financing with SCC 
 Assume: 
 Entrepreneur raises $10M now, extra $20M if good news realizes.
 If bad news comes out, he does not raise money. 
 Solve backwards: 
 If good news comes out, sell 13.3% of firm to raise $20M (=
13.3% * 150)
 In start-up stage, company is worth 2/3 * 150 = 100, sell 10% of 
the company to raise $10M. 
 The entrepreneur sells only 23.3% of company.  
Note: The initial round i nvestor has to ow n more than 10% of the company initially in anticipation of getting diluted in 
the subsequent round.  For example, if initially there are 1000 s hares owned by E, first round i nvestor buys 130 
shares (owning 13.4% of company) and second round i nvestor buys 173.9 s hares.

          <text>Relation of Deal Structure and Implied 
Firm Value: Convertible Preferred 
	VCs typically derive the post-money (pre-money) value of 
a firm based on the terms of the convertible preferred contract.  
 If, for example, the VC invests $2M in the above convertible 
preferred contract (which converts into 40% of the firms common 
stock), then VC will say that the post-money value is $2M/.4 = 
$5M and the pre-money value is $3M ($5M -$2M) 
 Alternatively, if the VC method comes up with a value of $5M 
post-money, and the investment is $2M , then the VC method 
chooses a % ownership, s, such that s*$5M = $2M. Here s is 40%.

          <text>Backing Out V* Using Option Pricing 
	We know that if the VC is getting a market return: 
$2M = Value of Option (A) + Value of Option (B).
	If we know the risk-free rate (rf) and the strike prices (FV and 
CV), and take a guess at the maturity (T) and the volatility of 
the investment (). The only thing we dont know is V*. All we 
need to do i s reverse engineer the Black Scholes formula. 
	Thus, suppose rf=5%, FV=2, CV=5, T=3, and =50%.  What 
must V* be?

          <text>The Role of Preferred Stock 
	Preferred feature aligns incentives of entrepreneur with VC to 
strive for large payoffs 
 Limits returns to the founde r for modest outcomes -incentives to 
reach high payoffs 
	The extent to which the VC wants to encourage the entrepreneur 
to go for the big payoffs can be controlled by specific choice of 
security. Redeemable Preferred + Common Stock &gt;

          <text>An Example to Make the Point 
	Assume the VC invest $2M . And va lue of the firm at IPO is V* with 
probability 0.5 and is liquidity for V=$1M with probability 0.5. What 
is the implied value V* the VC is offering based on the deal terms of a 
convertible preferred contract? 
	In order for the VC to earn a market return on her investment: 
$2M = 0.5*40%*V* + 0.5*100% *$1M , 
 The implied value V* is $7.5M. 
	In contrast, to break even under common stock we would need: 
$2M = 0.5*40%*V + 0.5*40%*$1M 
 The implied value is $9M

 Financial returns are divided to 
 Reward investors for their investments in the firm 
 Provide high-powered incentives to entrepreneurs to maximize 
value and to stay with the firm 
 Provide VCs with incentives to add value 
Contrast with incentives in firms 
 Dynamic allocation of control: 
 Gives more control to entrepreneur if things turn out well
 Gives more control to VC if things do no t turn out well

          <text>Why this Approach is Problematic 
 Ignoring the liquidation value has two implications: 
 Because investors get 100% of the firm in liquidation, if the firm 
has value in liquidation, they need less equity upon conversion to 
compensate them for their initial investment. 
 Because investors get 100% of the firm in liquidation, the implied 
pre-and post-money valuation that is offered to the entrepreneur is 
overstated!

          <text>Liquidation Preference over Common Stock
 Prevents the Take-the-Money-and-Run Problem

 Tax Deferral 
 Redemption of preferred is just return of capital, thus no capital 
gains tax 
 Favorable Pricing of Common Stock 
 IRS will accept low common-stock valuations and thus will not put 
heavy tax burden on employees/founder with common stock.

 Conversion option: 
 If initial investment is $2,000,000 and conversion price is $5/sh, 
then can convert into 400,000 shares. If there are initially 600 ,000 
common shares outstanding, then own 40% of the common stock 
on conversion. 
 In this case, will conve rt if .4*V&gt;$2M or V&gt;$5M (ignoring 
accrued dividends). 
 Automatic Conversion 
 VC must convert at an IPO provided the IPO price is greater than 
some multiple of the initial conversion price. 
 The median multiple is 3.0; it is higher for early stage deals (4.0); 
lower for later stage deals (2.7)

          <text>Decision Analysis vs. Option Pricing 
	The Option Pricing Method gives a higher valuation than the 
Decision Analysis Method (65 vs. 50). 
	Note that you need the same info rmation to price the options 
using both methods. 
	Both methods have their drawbacks 
 The Option Pricing Method assumes that there is arbitrage 
when there clearly isnt 
 The Decision Analysis Method discounts payoffs using 
CAPM-based discount rates which assume that payoffs are 
linear.</text>

          <text>Option Pricing in the Case of Focal 
 Find risk neutral probabilities 
 Market value of project is 39.0. This is the discounted value 
of the expected payoffs in the low and and high markup 
states assuming a probability of 0.5 for each state and a 
16% discount rate. 
 The risk-neutral probabilities are given by:
 * (137.0) + (1 - ) * (-59.0) = 39.0 * (1.07)2
 So,  = 0.54 
 Present value of the Focal option: 
 PV= (0.54 * 137.0 + 0.46*0) / (1.07)2 = 65.6</text>

          <text>Corporate Acquisition Process is Complex
	Each company has its own acquisition process
	The process can be lengthy and frustrating 
	Many internal constituents have to be satisfied 
and approve 
	The Corporate Development VP is your guide 
through this process 
	at some point, you have to view him as a 
partner rather than an adversary

          <text>How to make sure you get the best 
price from a strategic buyer
	Threat of competition! 
	Need to create a stalking horse with at 
least one other strategic buyer 
	Quietly shop the company to a selected 
few 
	use your banker, your VCs

          <text>Strategic Acquisition Price is Usually Higher 
than Public Market Price
 Synergies that accrue only to a strategic buyer: 
 cost advantages (procurement leverage, 
manufacturing scale, supply chain, etc.)
	no incremental SG&amp;A (sell acquired products through 
existing distribution channels) 
	R&amp;D avoidance (buy vs. make) 
	Much higher profits to a strategic buyer 
	higher gross profits 
	gross profits = net profits

          <text>Strategic Buyer has different view of valuation
 Internal Business Case, usually involves: 
 higher volumes and revenue 
 lower product cost, R&amp;D, SG&amp;A 
 but has to deal with 
 goodwill amortization 
 EPS considerations 
 Very important are: 
 time to market considerations 
 competitive threats

          <text>Examples of Internal Corporate Constituents
	Accounting (cash vs. stock? pooling of interest? Line-
item consolidation? Equity vs. Cost method of 
accounting? EPS implications.) 
	Legal (IP, antitrust, national security, regulatory filings, 
disclosure requirements, board approvals) 
	HR (retention, different cultures, compensation
practices) 
	Sponsoring Business Unit (commitment to revenue and 
cost objectives, post acquisition integration plans) 
	Corporate Development (external interface to you, 
gearbox to internal processes, your guide and partner!)
