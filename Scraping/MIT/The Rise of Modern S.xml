          <text>Directionality 
   The 2nd law of thermodynamics 
also implied that the universe has a 
direction . Newtons laws of motion 
are perfectly reversible. Not so a 
heat-filled world. 
   Akin to the historical impulse that 
flourished in the 19th century, in 
fields like natural history, geology, and evolution. 
   But when Thomson calculated how old the earth could be, based on its rate of cooling from molten rock, he found 
t = 20  400 million years. Much too 
short to match geological and evolutionary ideas.

          <text>An Unseen World 
Thomson read a progressive 
lesson in the directionality of the 
2nd law. 
His colleagues, Peter Tait and 
Balfour Stewart, went further. Only in our physical surroundings does useful energy degrade and dissipate. 
That dissipated energy cycles back 
to an unseen (spiritual) world, which is perfect and unchanging. 
We endeavor to show that immortality 
is strictly in accordance with the latest developments in thermodynamics.</text>

Joule considered his experiments to be 
clear proof that heat was simply a form of

Though he managed to publish several 
papers and present his work at meetings 
like the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), few 
took his work seriously. 
No one could replicate his findings; and his claimed 
accuracy was beyond what most natural philosophers

          <text>Work and Waste 
   To Thomson, the conservation of 
energy (1st law) meant that only God 
can create and destroy energy. 
   But people can dissipate  that energy 
 not destroy it, but render it into a 
less-useful state (2nd law). The 2nd law 
seemed to open space for human free
will  but also for human responsibility 
.   
   Thus the 2nd law entailed a moral  requirement, 
bolstering the famous Protestant work ethic: always do what you can to conserve useful work.

Thomsons papers closely. He was the fito reconcile Carnot and Joule, in 1850.  
   The 
essential  point of Carnots work 
(said Clausius) was that the heat engine 
worked by getting heat to flow from hot tcold. One need not further assume that 
heat (or caloric) was conserved.  d

          <text>Statistically Speaking 
  Clausius and Thomson considered entropy 
increase to be a universal law, akin to Newtons laws. 
   James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann 
agreed that heat was just the 
motion  of small 
bodies; they tried to formulate a statistical  
treatment of all those tiny motions. 
   S  0 is a statistical regularity , but not an 
unbreakable law. Back to Aristotle: always or 
for the most part. First serious check on 
Newtonian determinism .

          <text>Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations.  And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom and knowledge, and see and hear and know what are foul and what are fair, what are bad and what are good, what are sweet, and what are unsavory.  And by the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors assail us.  All these things we endure from the brain, when it is not healthy.  In these ways I am of the opinion that the brain exercises the greatest power in man.  This is the interpreter to us of those things which emanate from the air, when the brain happens to be in a sound state.  On the Sacred Disease

Alchemy remains a strange hybrid to 
modern eyes: shrouded in secrecy, 
obscure riddles, and mysticism, it was 
also the major impetus for new 
experimental methods. It also provided
the first serious challenge to 
Aristotelian matter theory in centuries.

  Their goal: the wholesale revival of another culture; to imitate and recover the splendors of ancient Rome.  HansHolbeintheYounger, TheAmbassadors ,1533

          <text>Einstein and Experiment
For a long time, physicists, philosophers, 
and historians read Einsteins relativity as a 
direct response to the Michelson -Morley 
experiment.
Yet its not clear whether Einstein even 
knew about the results at the time. Either 
way, they dont seem to have played much 
role in his thinking.
Does that 
mean that 
Einstein was 
uninterested in 
experiments?Image of Thematic Origins of 
Scientific Thought Kepler to 
Einstein, Gerald Holton, removed

Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to 
discover any motion of the earth relatively to the light medium, 
suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of 
mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of 
absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown 
to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of 
electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference 
for which the equations of mechanics hold good.

          <text>Principle of Relativity
1. Laws of physics are valid in any 
inertial frame of reference
2. Speed of light is constant, 
independent of motion of source.We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the 
Principle of Relativity) to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another 
postulate which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely that light 
is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent 
of the state of motion of the emitting body.  These two postulates suffice for the 
attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving 
bodies based on Maxwells theory for stationary bodies.  The introduction of the 
luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be 
developed will not require an absolute stationary space provided with special 
properties, nor assign a velocity vector to a point in space in which electromagnetic 
processes take place.

When the magnet and coil 
were in relative motion, an 
electric current was produced.
Physicists had given two 
completely distinct explanations 
for the effect, depending on 
which item was moving.
Einstein insisted that physicists had been too 
clever by half: there was only one phenomenon , so 
there should only be one explanation .Diagram of how electricity is generated using a coil

that we can scarcely avoid

But then solutions to Maxwells (transformed) wave equation are 
no longer sines and cosines and yet we measure light to behave 
like sines and cosines all the time, on our moving earth.

          <text>Kinematics First
Inspired by Mach, Einstein began with 
kinematics, not dynamics.If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of its co -
ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind that a 
mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are 
quite clear as to what we understand by time. We have to take into account 
that all our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments of 
simultaneous events . If, for instance, I say, That train arrives here at 7 o'clock, 
I mean something like this: The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 
and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.

          <text>Time Zones
German railway system, 1910
All during Einsteins childhood.That unity of time is indispensible for the 
satisfactory operating of railways is universally 
recognized, and is not disputed. But, meine Herren , 
we have in Germany five different units of time. [] 
We have thus in Germany five zones, with all the 
drawbacks and disadvantages which result. These we 
have in our own fatherland, besides those we dread to 
meet at the French and Russian boundaries. This is, I 
may say, a ruin which has remained standing out of 
the once splintered condition of Germany, but which, 
since we have become an empire, it is proper should 
be done away with.

after 1870 war with 
France, and 1871

Bern train station, ca. 1860
French train wreck, 1895Until the late 19thcentury, there were 
no coordinated time zones. Each town 
kept local time, based on a clock in its 
town square.
Passengers riding from Boston to New 
York City had to change their watches by 
37 minutes after their trip.</text>

          <text>Relativity of Simultaneity
If there is no absolute time, how can we compare times 
measured in different places? By sending light signals , since c= 
constant.

See: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Einstein_train_relativity_of_simultaneity.png
Thus we see that we cannot attach any absolute signification to the 
concept of simultaneity, but that two events which, viewed from a 
system of co -ordinates, are simultaneous, can no longer be looked 
upon as simultaneous events when envisaged from a system which is in 
motion relatively to that system. Albert Einstein, On the

Leaning Tower of PisaLegend has it that Galileo 
challenged the Aristotelians by 
dropping balls of different weights 
off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, to 
demonstrate that they would fall 
at the same rate, contra Aristotles 
teachings.
First told by Galileos friend and biographer after 
Galileos death. Most likely the story was apocryphal, 
though Galileo may well have performed less 
dramatic tests while living in Pisa.

          <text>For the Most Part
Aristotle did not believe in universal laws, of the kind 
we might seek today. He built his project around 
regularities and tendencies : what happens in nature 
always or for the most part.Among things which are, some are 
always in the same state [], and some are 
not of necessity nor always, but for the most 
part. [] There is, then, besides these, 
something which is fortuitous and 
accidental. [] That there is no science of 
the accidental is obvious; for all science is 
either of that which is always or of that 
which is for the most part.

Godfrey Kneller, portrait of 
Isaac Newton, 1689Isaac Newton (1642 1727): his 
father died before he was born; his 
mother sent him off to be raised by 
his grandmother. He inherited a 
small farm, but failed at the task. So 
instead it was off to Cambridge 
University in 1661. 
A lackluster student, his breakthrough came when 
Cambridge closed because of the plague (1665 1666). 
Back in Woolsthorpe, on his own, Newton invented the 
calculus and most of the laws of motion</text>

          <text>Natural Motions Revisited
Galileo broke with Aristotle in 
specifics , but not really in 
framework : he concluded that 
Nature prefered uniform 
circular motion for allnatural 
motions. 
His reason was also quasi -Aristotelian: only 
uniform circular motion was perfect enough to 
exist eternally; its indefinitely sustainable.If the object kept moving horizontally, it would 
go uphill; but then its innate heaviness would 
change its path.  Only a circular path would allow 
the ball to remain in uniform -speed motion.</text>

Nature abhors a vacuum: 
Aristotle assumed a plenum universe . The javelin throwers 
hand sets some of the 
surrounding air in 
motion. That air, in turn, 
acts on the neighboring 
air, keeping the javelin 
moving forward.
The pushes from the air diminish over time. Eventually the 
javelin falls to the ground: its natural motion (straight down) 
overcomes the impressed motion.Photo courtesy of tableatny on Flickr.</text>

Crossbow attributed to Philo of Byzantium

Philo of Byzantium, Belopoeica , ca. 250 BCEWhen designing military weapons, it 
was necessary to determine [parameters 
of the weapons] not accidentally or 
haphazardly but by some definite 
method. [] This could not be done 
except by increasing or decreasing the 
diameter of the bore and testing the 
results.
For it is not possible to arrive at a 
complete solution of the problems 
involved merely by reason and by the 
methods of mechanics. Many 
discoveries can, in fact, be made only 
as a result of trial.

1. Planets roughly follow the path of the sun 
(within 5of the ecliptic).
2. They tend to move W to E over the year, 
but with varying speeds.
3. They sometimes display retrograde motion .
4. They appear brightest during retrograde.

assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can 
the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?</text>

Nearly all of the ancient scholars 
assumed geocentrism : that the Earth 
sits at rest in the middle of the cosmos, 
while the sun, planets, and stars 
revolve around it.
 Aristotle, ca. 330 BCE
[Some people think] there is nothing 
against their supposing the heavens 
immobile and the earth as turning on the 
same axis from west to east very nearly 
one revolution a day. But it has escaped 
their notice in the light of what happens 
around us in the air that such a notion 
would seem altogether absurd .

Founded in 1259. Rather than try to replace
Ptolemys system, they worked to reform it 
from within, saving his empirical results. To 
them, the equant was repugnant because it 
was inconsistent with Ptolemys stated 
program.

Finally in 1543, Copernicus published his 
full treatment. De Revolutionibus is a 
strange admixture of quasi -Aristotelian 
arguments, Ptolemy -styled quantitative 
models, and fits to data.
If the Earth is at rest, then the distant stars 
must execute vehement motions for us to see 
them rise and set everyday.
The Earth is a sphere, and the motion 
appropriate to a sphere is rotation in a circle.
The sun belongs in the center: At rest, in the middle of 
everything, is the sun. For in this most beautiful temple, who would 
place this lamp in another or better position than that from which it 
can light up the whole thing at the same time?</text>

ca. 1350Averroes (d. 1198): We should [seek] the true astronomy 
that is possible from the standpoint of physical principles. For 
nothing of the true science of astronomy exists in our time, the 
astronomy of today being only in agreement with calculations 
and not with what exists.
Al-Bitruji (d. 1217): Ever since my youth I have followed the 
teachings of the ancients concerning the motion of the heavens, 
especially the teachings of the master of this science, Ptolemy. 
Yet I remained skeptical about those of Ptolemys hypotheses 
which I found repugnant because Nature contradicted them.

PQIn addition to Apolloniuss eccentric

third device: the equant . A planet 
swept out equal angles in equal times 
with respect to the equant, rather than 
the true center of its circle.
Using all three es, Ptolemy could 
match observed planetary motion to 
within 1 on the sky unsurpassed 
until Tycho Brahe in the 1580s!
But Ptolemys equant broke with Platos dictum (and

Copernicus first argued for heliocentrism based on 
simplicity . But when he had to match real observations of 
planetary motion, he needed (nearly) as many epicycles as 
Ptolemy had used his full model was no simpler than 
Ptolemys system.
Nor did Copernicus match empirical data better than 
Ptolemy had done. He couldnt Copernicus fit all of his 
parameters so as to exactly reproduce Ptolemys data . So 
no observational differences whatsoever between the two 
systems.
So why did Copernicus bother? Because he thought 
heliocentrism was real.</text>

G. Pencz, Andreas Osiander , 1544Copernicus saw page proofs of De Rev on 
his deathbed. An anonymous preface was 
added to the published version by the 
Lutheran theologian Andreas Osiander .
The duty of the astronomer [is to] adopt 
whatever suppositions enable the motions to be 
computed correctly from the principles of 
geometry. These hypotheses need not be true 
nor even probable. On the contrary, if they 
provide a calculus consistent with the 
observations, that alone is enough. [] If any 
causes are derived by the imagination, they are 
not put forward to convince anyone that they are 
true, but merely to provide a reliable basis for 
computation. Philosophers , not 
astronomers or 
mathematicians, 
were to decide 
matters of cause

Apollonius also invented the

vice versa, if one tuned the parameters 
correctly.
Ptolemy repeated the proof: It must be understood 
that the appearances can be cared for interchangeably 
according to either hypothesis, when the same ratios 
are involved in each. The same appearances agree 
with either hypothesis. (pp. 86 -88)epicycle

opposite directions, a planet attached 
to both would trace out a hippopede : 
retrograde motion.
Butthe hippopedes were of fixed size and shape. If 
one adjusted the parameters to match a planets speed
during retrograde, one couldnt match its arc, and vice 
versa.Image of a Eudoxan sphere removed due to

          <text>Lawsuit
When Copernicuss assistant saw the 
published version complete with 
Osianders preface he sued the publisher 
for breach of trust, and sought to force 
the publisher to issue a corrected version.
The town council ruled in favor of the publisher: 
100 years after Gutenbergs printing press, notions 
of authorship (let alone copyright) were still in flux, 
and quite different from todays standards.
Few knew that Osianders (anonymous) preface hadnt 
been written by Copernicus only revealed in print 80 
years later. So most early readers took Copernicuss 
message to be that heliocentrism was merely convenient , 
not really true.(1709)</text>

Nicholas Copernicus (1473 1543) 
was the son of a wealthy merchant. 
He studied astronomy in Poland 
(1490s), before moving to Bologna to 
study canon (Church) law, and then 
Padua to study medicine. By 1503, he 
was back in Poland working as the 
assistant and physician to his uncle, 
the Bishop. 
He worked on legal issues, taxes, currency reform 
and, after hours, astronomy.</text>

During the 1950s and 1960s, new patrons, new 
tools and techniques, and new discoveries (quasars, 
pulsars, microwave background radiation) brought 
Einsteins general relativity back to physicists 
attention.  Today it is at the heart of cutting -edge 
developments.
The fortunes of Einsteins temple of 
relativity erected during World War I, 
rejected by the Nazis, and reborn during the 
Cold War rose and fell with the political 
tides. Even the most abstract theory could 
not escape the fetters of everyday life.Photo courtesy of koolkao on Flickr.</text>

The war shaped how news of Einsteins 
work spread. One of the first converts 
was the Russian mathematician, 
Vsevolod Frederiks , who had been 
studying in Gttingen . 
Soon after hearing Einstein 
lecture on the new theory, 
Frederiks was detained as a 
civilian prisoner of war. Upon 
his release, he returned to his 
native St. Petersburg and 
helped train Russias first 
experts in general relativity.

The war choked off all direct contact between 
scientists in Germany and Britain.  Arthur 
Eddington learned about general relativity from 
Willem de Sitter, who sent him extensive 
English -language primers.
Eddington, a Quaker and 
conscientious objector, 
completed his wartime national 
service by preparing a new 
eclipse expedition to test 
Einsteins prediction about the 
bending of starlight.A. S. Eddington, ca. 1920

          <text>Stark and Lenard Attack
Two-part strategy:  1.  Einsteins work was repugnant to the Aryan 
sensibility.  2.  Key results had been plagiarized from early Aryan 
researchers. (First of all, youre wrong, and second of all, we got there first!)
The concept of force, 
which was introduced by 
Aryan scientists [like 
Newton and Galileo!], 
obviously arises from the 
personal experience of 
human labor, of manual 
creation, which has been 
and is the essential content 
of the life of Aryan man.
The little -known Johann 
Soldner had written a 
paper in 1803 (which 
Stark and Lenard 
republished in 1921), in 
which he had used 
Newtonian gravity to 
derive the bending of light 
near the sun.  (Soldners 
result was one -half of 
Einsteins value.)</text>

          <text>Spacetime is Curved
Light is special: nothing travels faster than light, and everyone 
agrees on its speed. So people can use light to chart the shortest 
distances between two points.  Light becomes a mapping tool .
If a light beams path is curved by gravity, this is like saying that 
spacetime itself is curved by gravity.  The geometry of spacetime 
need notbe Euclidean .

          <text>Backlash:  deutsche Physik
Einstein told the London Times , 1919: 
Today I am described in Germany as a 
German servant, and in England as a Swiss 
Jew.  Should it ever be my fate to be 
represented as a bte noire , I should, on the 
contrary, become a Swiss Jew for the 
Germans and a German savant for the 
English.

          <text>Races ... are thus rather like angels.  
Many people believe in them, devoutly.  
They can even tell you what properties

With this profound new knowledge, 
humankind is on the verge of gaining 
immense, new power to heal.  
Genome science will have a real

          <text>(1) Bring Your Genes to MIT: As part of freshman orientation, all 
incoming students are asked (but not required) to submit a cheek 
swab in August for genetic analysis.  Geneticists will screen three 
alleles, related to folate, lactose, and alcohol metabolism.  
Students will be given their results and then join in faculty-led 
discussions of the science and meaning of modern genetics.
(2) Frustrated with the politicization of science in the United 
States, you move your reproductive biology lab from Boston to an 
unregulated overseas locale and set out to clone a human.
(3) Now that large sections of the human and Neanderthal 
genomes have been sequenced, you set out to use targeted 
mutation technologies to transform a human cell line into a 
Neanderthal cell line and then use somatic cell nuclear transfer 
to produce a living Neanderthal.</text>

          <text>Galileo taught mathematics at the University 
of Pisa and the University of Padua during the 1580s and 1590s. He also served as a 
consultant to the Venetian Senate. 
   In 1609 he saw a spyglass, which had just 
been invented in the Netherlands. He made a few minor improvements and presented it to 
the Venetian Senate, as if it were entirely his 
own design.  Clever Appropriation

          <text>Turning Skyward 
Soon after impressing the 
Venetian Senate with the new 
telescope, Galileo turned it skyward. 
He quickly made three major 
discoveries: 
craters on the moon; resolved the Milky Way into 
individual stars; 
four moons circling Jupiter. 
He quickly wrote up his findings in a tiny book, 
Sidereus Nuncius , or Starry Messenger  (1610).</text>

          <text>Inverse-Square Law 
Newton began with Keplers third law 
(R 3 / T2 = constant), assuming circular 
orbits. The latest data from the 
Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, 
showed that most planetary orbits were indistinguishable from circles. 
Newton had already derived 
a = v2 / r 
for circular motion. To obey Keplers law, the force of gravity between the 
sun and planet must then vary as 1/
r 2.
 From his own third law of motion, Newton 
then deduced that F = Gm1m2 /r 2.</text>

          <text>Enter Laplace  
   Pierre Simon de Laplace  (1749  
1827) grew up studying natural 
theology arguments inspired by 
Newton. But by the time of his 
childhood  even before the French Revolution  such arguments held much less sway, even among theology students like the young Laplace. 
Mme.Feytaud, PierreSimondeLaplace ,1842 
 After studying theology, Laplace moved to Paris and studied under Jean dAlembert, famous 
philosophe  and 
co-editor of the Encyclopdie . DAlembert

Bellarmine died in 
1624, and Cardinal 
Barberini became 
Pope Urban soon after 
that. Barberini had a more liberal reputation; he allowed Galileo to discuss Copernicanism, 
so long as it was 
properly hypothetical. 
Galileo took this as license to publish his Dialogues 
on the Two Chief World Systems  (1632).</text>

responded by placing Copernicuss De 
Revolutionibus  on the Index in 1616: 
the book could not be re-published until the nature of heliocentrism was made more clearly 
hypothetical . 
Bellarmine delivered the verdict to Galileo in person: 
he was to stop defending Copernicanism.</text>

   1. Galileo was rational;

   2. The Church was reasonable; Galileo was stubborn. He repeatedly overstepped his bounds (lecturing Cardinals how to interpret the Bible; placing the Popes positions in mouth of 
Simplicius ); he overclaimed 
what he could prove; he left out the Churchs preferred system (Tychonic) altogether; and he misunderstood the nature of scientific

surface to accentuate its 
Earth-like features: mountains and valleys.

different, the planet would not be habitable by life as we know it.

   Emboldened by his new position, 
Galileo wrote an open letter to Cosimos mother, the Grand Duchess 
Christina, in 1615. She had asked 
Galileo how one might reconcile Copernicanism with Scripture. 
   He used the open letter format to 
avoid having to go through the official 
Church censors. 
    Galileo cautioned against literal interpretations of the Bible. The Bible teaches us how to go to Heaven, not how the heavens go.

          <text>Court Philosopher 
   In the Sidereus Nuncius , Galileo 
made passing remarks about 
Copernicanism. Once he got to 
Florence, however, he became 
Cosimos Court Philosopher , 
rather than a university 
mathematician. Now it was his job 
to talk about causes  not just 
useful calculations but physical 
truths of astronomy. 
   His position at court also likely shaped his choice of 
literary conventions. His later books were published as 
dialogues : part of his job was to entertain the Grand

Newton saw evidence of Gods hand in more 
than just setting up the universe. Newton 
studied perturbations  to the planets orbits, and 
became convinced that instabilities would 
accumulate  over time. 
Jupiter and Saturn 
perturb each others orbits; Newton feared that these 
perturbations would grow 
without bound. 
So Newton concluded that God must 
constantly intervene  in the universe, to 
keep the whole system stable. Images of Jupiter and Saturn, and a grandfather

Are quarks the new atoms 
indivisible and eternal 
corpuscles imagined by the 
ancients?
Probably not: our current view is that matter is 
more like light than like solid, massy, hard, 
impenetrable, moveable Particles. If certain 
popular models are correct (e.g. SUSY), particles of 
matter (like quarks) can transmute into quanta of 
pure force (like photons) and back again.Image of "The Lightness of Being," Frank Wilczek,

          <text>An Ordered Heavens 
In the midst of a lecture in Graz 
in 1595, Kepler realized that the 
number  and arrangement  of the 
planets might be dictated by pure 
mathematics: embedding of 
perfect solids. 
There only exist five perfect 
solids (pyramid, cube, 
octahedron, dodecahedron, and 
icosohedron).
 Kepler hastily wrote Mysterium Cosmographicum 
(1596): there can only be six planets, and their spacing 
is determined geometrically.</text>

Kepler sent copies of his book to 
all the known astronomers in 
Europe, along with flattering letters  
he was desperate to get out of Graz 
and find a better position. 
Tycho received the book and 
immediately contacted Kepler, since 
a competing astronomer (Ursus) had 
quoted an earlier flattering letter from Kepler. 
It worked: In 1600, Kepler joined Tycho as 
Imperial Mathematician at Rudolf IIs court.</text>

also troubled by it.

born into the Danish nobility, with 
close ties to the King of Denmark. 
   His uncle abducted him as a young 
child  arguing that his father already had enough sons  and so Tychos upbringing differed from that of his 
brothers. He went to university; they 
pursued traditional military careers. 
   He still fought battles  e.g., a duel as a university student (with one of his cousins), in which he lost his nose. While recuperating, he studied medicine, 
astrology, and alchemy.</text>

not a perfect circle, but 
some sort of oval. Kepler, AstronomiaNova, 1609

had been sickly as a child. His 
mother was nearly burned at the 
stake for witchcraft (Kepler got a 
last-minute stay). He went on to study under one of the earliest Copernican converts (1590s). Though he enjoyed math and 
astronomy, he planned to become 
a Lutheran minister.

Protestant seminary in Graz died, in 1594, and Kepler was summoned to replace him.</text>

WalterGilbert, DeMagnete ,1600    Around the time he moved to 
Prague, Kepler read Gilberts De 
Magnete  (1600). Now Kepler began to 
think of the sun in terms of magnetism : 
perhaps it exerted a physical (attractive) force on the planets.  
   Kepler was thus the first to begin 
thinking about Copernicanism in terms 
of 
physics : there was a reason to reckon  
planetary motion with respect to the 
sun. 
   Kepler mixed this modern-sounding approach with sun-mysticism: the sun is like a god sitting in its throne, around which all else revolves.</text>

1. Planets move on ellipses , with the 
sun at one focus. 
2. Planets sweep out equal areas in 
equal times, as measured from the sun. 
Keplers approach combined speculative 
physics, number-mysticism, calculational 
convenience, and Tychos empirical data. Both had emerged as convenient 
approximations rather than laws.</text>

he again concluded that the comet 
must be superlunary (rather than an atmospheric disturbance). 
  Moreover, as Tycho continued to analyze his data over the next decade, he realized that the comets path cut straight through several planets orbits. Not only was 
change possible in the heavens; perhaps there 
were no  
crystalline spheres of Aristotelian quintessence.</text>

By the late 1770s, he found that

contained eminently respirable 
air. He concluded that all acids 
must come from that air, so he 
named it oxygen (acid -
generating). 
To Lavoisier, combustion arose when a burning 
substance combined with oxygen from the airhence 
the weight gain. But why was heat released? Caloric: a

the new air was able to absorb even more phlogiston than 
common air. 
In 1774, Priestley traveled to Paris and told the 
Lavoisiers about his experiments. Image of calx of mercury removed due to copyright restrictions.</text>

S.Ivanov, APeasantLeavinghisLandlordon
YurievDay ,ca.1890    In 1861, the Russian Tsar 
emancipated the serfs throughout the Russian empire. 
The universities were flooded 
with new students. Dmitri Mendeleev (1834  1907), a young chemistry professor in St. Petersburg, began writing a new 
textbook. 
   Lavoisier had identified 33 elements. By Mendeleevs 
day, 63 were known. He eschewed chemical theory and focused on laboratory techniques: how do chemists 
learn about simple substances?</text>

          <text>Mass Balance 
Lavoisier, Traitlmentairedechimie ,1789  Inspired by advances in physics,  
Lavoisier sought precision and  quantification. He carefully weighed  
reactants before and after  
combustion to ensure that total mass  was conserved. When he re-did  Priestleys experiment with mercury,  he found that the precipitate weighed  
more  than the original sample. How  
could that be, if combustion involved the release  of phlogiston? 
   Priestley was skeptical in part because Lavoisiers 
apparatus was too elaborate. Few others could afford 
comparable equipment or replicate the results.</text>

          <text>The Terror 
   By 1793, chaos reigned. France 
was fighting wars against Prussia and Austria, and internal factions divided 
the country. The Legislature 
appointed a 12-person Committee on Public Safety, which quickly imposed martial law. 
  Between September 1793 and 
July 1794, tens of thousands of people were charged with treason  
and sent to the guillotine.

EllenSharples, JosephPriestley ,1794    Joseph Priestley (1733  1804) was 
barred from Oxbridge because of his religious beliefs. He was educated in 
Dissenting Academies outside 
London, with their mix of abstract theory and practical application. His work was principally supported by new institutions like the Lunar Society 
of Birmingham, rather than the Royal 
Society. 
   A master experimentalist and writer, Priestley discovered more new gases than any of his contemporaries.</text>

Mendeleev left gaps in his table to be 
filled in: he predicted  the weights and 
chemical properties of three new 
elements. 
The discovery of those missing 
elements in the 1870s helped to 
establish Mendeleevs reputation and 
that of his periodic table. 
The discoveries also helped to solidify the association 
between chemical elements  and physical atoms . Image of "A Well Ordered Thing: Dimitrii Mendeleev and

Lavoisier, ElementsofChemistry,1790   Chemical nomenclature was a mess: 
substances were named for their composition, or the site they were found, 
or their discoverer,  No order, no 
system. 
   Inspired by Condillac and the 
Encyclopdie , Lavoisier introduced a 
rational order based on analysis : start 
with the simplest substances that cannot be further broken down, and build up from there.</text>

  Dalton was fascinated by the

each gas contributes pressure as if it were alone. The total vapor pressure is the sum of each partial pressure.</text>

Theophrastus: Anaximenes, a companion of 
Anaximander, also says, like him, that the 
underlying nature is one and infinite, but not 
undefined as Anaximander said but definite, 
for he identifies it as air; and it differs in its 
substantial nature by rarity and density. Being 
made finer it becomes fire, being made thicker 
it becomes wind, then cloud, then water, then 
earth, then stones; and the rest come into being 
from these.

engaging with Thaless and Anaximanders ideas, 
trying to strengthen their weaknesses.</text>

We have infinitely more documents from the 
prescientific Babylonians and Egyptians than from the 
proto -scientific Presocratics! 
There does not exist a single original document from the 
Presocratics. Allof our information about them comes 
from (much) later commentaries.
"Others say that the earth rests on water. For this is the most ancient 
account we have received, which they say was given by Thales the 
Milesian , that it stays in place through floating like a log or some other 
such thing (for none of these rests by nature on air, but on water) --as 
though the same argument did not apply to the water supporting the 
earth as to the earth itself." ( R, 9)

Egotism? Later Greek philosophers 
attributed the birth of natural philosophy 
to the miracle of the Greek mind.
Wealth? Maybe they could afford 
a group of people whose job it was 
to speculate all day. Butothers at 
the time had leisure classes, too.
Literacy? Written texts permit critical 
inspection of ideas. Butothers had earlier 
alphabets, and most Presocratic 
communication was oral, not written.Photo courtesy of Mr G's Travels on Flickr.

Why start with the Presocratics rather than the 
Babylonians or Egyptians?
1. Took the gods out
2. General classes of phenomena
3. Self -consistent theories

          <text>Anaximander
Simplicius: Anaximander, the successor and 
pupil of Thales, said that the principle and 
element of existence was the apeiron
[Boundless], from which come into being all 
the heavens and the worlds in them.
The raw material ( apeiron ) is 
indestructible and everlasting. 
(Iocane powder, anyone?)
Solved Thaless problem of over -specificity by 
beginning with a non -ordinary substance. But 
he still left the nature of apeiron vague.Image of Wallace Shawn as Vizzini in The Princes Bride

Platos Academy in Athens (founded 
387 BCE) became one of the first 
static educational institutions, with 
regular faculty teaching a variety of 
subjects. 
Notlike todays universities: no 
degrees, no requirements, no term 
limits. Aristotle arrived at age 17 and 
stayed for 20 years!Plato (428 347 BCE) was a disciple 
of Socrates, and the principal defender 
of Socratess legacy following his 
execution for impiety in 399.</text>

          <text>Constructing Legacies
The later commentators, such as Aristotle, arranged the 
Presocratics into neat and tidy genealogies: A taught B, B 
taught C at a remove of 300 years!
Moreover, the later commentators had a stake in 
reconstructing the past to make things appear to lead 
straight to them.

          <text>Convoluted Provenance
After Aristotles death, his 
student Theophrastus 
gathered the manuscripts and 
gave them to his nephew, 
who buried them in a cave in 
Scepsis (modern -day Turkey) 
to keep them out of the 
hands of angry Athenians.
They remained there for two centuries until they were re-
discovered; transfered to Athens and then to Rome. The 
philosopher Andronicus prepared an edition ca. 50 BCE. 
Our Aristotle is almost entirely the product of 
Andronicuss filtering, editing, and compiling.

Plato held that a god -like 
craftsman ( notomnipotent) 
created all material things 
by (imperfectly) impressing 
the ideal forms into a kind 
of malleable clay: the 
Receptacle of Becoming, 
akin to Anaximanders 
apeiron . 
Medieval manuscript, translation and commentary 
on the Timaeus , ca. AD 900
Philosophers should only concern themselves with 
the ideal forms: only those are perfect and unchanging.</text>

          <text>Thales
Aristotle: Thales, the founder of this type of 
philosophy, says that it [the original principle 
of all things] is water , perhaps taking this 
supposition from seeing the nature of all things 
(like seeds) to be moist.
Thales attributed the unity of the cosmos 
to a substance of ordinary experience, 
rather than to the activity of the gods.
Perhaps he chose water because of its mutability: it can 
appear as a solid, liquid, or vapor.
Problem : How are non -wet things 
related to water? Over -specificity.</text>

          <text>The Role of Politics
International trade made Miletus a 
leading city by 700 BCE. Mercantile 
wealth broke the political power of the 
landed aristocracy. Merchants, in turn, 
needed laws to guarantee contracts: 
first Milesian constitution ca. 594 BCE.
These societal changes created an 
atmosphere of reasoned debate; they 
created a culture of critique and 
discussion.
Reason was invented in politics, and then 
applied to nature. What we call science might have 
its earliest roots in politics.Images of "Adversaries and Authorities: Investigations Into

          <text>Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations.  And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom and knowledge, and see and hear and know what are foul and what are fair, what are bad and what are good, what are sweet, and what are unsavory.  And by the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors assail us.  All these things we endure from the brain, when it is not healthy.  In these ways I am of the opinion that the brain exercises the greatest power in man.  This is the interpreter to us of those things which emanate from the air, when the brain happens to be in a sound state.  On the Sacred Disease
