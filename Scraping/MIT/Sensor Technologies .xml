          <text>Use physics and constraints to couple a 
measured quantity into an unknown 
 Temperature can infer wind velocity (heat loss) 
 Displacement can infer: 
 Pressure (with an elastomer or spring: F = kx) 
 Volume of fluid in a tank (V = Ah) 
 Velocity (2 measurements at different times: v = dx/dt) 
 Temperature (thermometer level)  Angle from vertical (displacement of a bubble) 
 Measurements are used with a mathematical model 
to derive other parameters 
 Estimation and Kalman Filtering, etc.

Is
The connection between a sensor and an interface ci rcuit. In the image on the left, the sensor has 
voltage output. In the image on the right, the sensor has current output. 
 Sensors produce different kinds of signals
 Voltage output or current output
 Cant necessarily take sensor output and put right 
into microprocessor ADC or logic input
 Signal may need:
 High-to-low impedance buffer, current-to-voltage ZVi = VioZi + Zo Ii = IooZi + Zo Z

Goals 
 Attain a broad familiarity with many different 
sensors useful in a broad definition of HCI 
 Develop judgment of what sensors and modalities are 
appropriate for different applications 
 Know how to electronically condition the sensor, 
hook it up to a microcomputer, and process the signal 
(at least basically) 
 Have some idea of how/where these sensors were 
used before 
 Have a reasonable idea of how different sensors work 
 Develop a sense for recognizing bad data and an 
intuition of how to resolve problems</text>

Origins 
 This class is a proper expansion of the pair of 
lectures on electronics and sensors that I give in 
MAS863, How to Make (Almost) Anything 
 Even so, sensors is a vast and general field 
 Any one lecture here can become least an entire course 
elsewhere at MIT 
 You wont become an expert 
 Although you will be able to wander into a restaurant in 
sensorland and order a meal from the menu</text>

Sensing as Commodity 
 Sensors are now becoming a commodity, and soon can 
easily be designed into most any device. 
 Rather than omitting them from a cost/complexity viewpoint, it 
begins to make more sense to just include them if theres any 
suspicion that they could be needed. 
 This causes a shift in how sensors are used  rather than rely on 
only 1 or 2 sensors made a priori to measure particular quantities, 
many sensors will be used that dont necessarily exactly measure 
the quantity of interest (especially as applications will become 
more general and evolve over time).

The Simple Differential Amplifier 
 Subtracts two input signals 
 Input resistors must be equal, feedb ack and shunt resistors must be equal 
 Provides voltage gain 
 The input impedances arent equal, however 
 The amplifier is unbalanced! 
 A high-impedance sensor will produce common- mode errors (e.g., the system will be 
sensitive to the common voltage) 
 Differential sensors will be more sensitive to induced pickup signals (which tend to be 
high impedance) 44</text>

          <text>Electronics control the flow of electrons 
 Voltage is the potential the electrons drop across the 
circuit 
 Measured between 2 points, t ypically a test point and ground 
 Equivalent to the pressure in a pipe 
 Current is the flux of electrons per unit time (Amperes) 
 Current is defined as flowing from + to - 
 Opposite real electron motion! 
 Equivalent to the dynamic amount of fluid through the pipe 
 Resistance relates voltage to current 
 E.g., the width of the pipe 
V I = R Voltage (Volts) 
Current (Amperes) 
Resistance (Ohms) V = IR 
Resistance turns current into voltage

Shape Tape
Characteristics, S1280CS multiplexed ShapeTape
(Specifications will vary for other lengths, number of sensors, etc.)
Dimensions of tape: 1.3 x 13 x 1800 mm nominal
Dimensions of interface box: 16 x 54 x 168 mm nominalOperating temperature: -20 to 50 deg c
Sensitive zone: outboard 480 mm contains 16 sensors arranged in 8 pairs
Sensor length: each sensor integrates curvature over a 60 mm portion of the sensitive zone
Sensor pair: each pair resolves bend and twist, using calibration constants
Calibration: Circle, twist, &amp; flat poses yield stored calibration constantsData: x,y,z and orientation at 16 or more points alon g sensitive zone, relative to inboard reference end
Calibrated Range of each sensor: 40 mm radius bend; 22.8 deg twist
Safe Bending radius: 20 mm radius
Spatial sampling limits: each monotonic (single polarity) curve requires two sensor lengths
Operating range for end of 'U' shape: two elliptical volumes, 160 x 250 mm each.
Endpoint accuracy within operating range and sampling limits: 1-3%  of length is a reasonable expectation for postional errors; thus, 
for the first 100 mm of a tape, the error can be expected to be 1-3 mm, and if the tape is 1000 mm long, the error at the tip c an be 
expected to be 10-30 mm. Endpoint resolution: 0.3 mm rms, x,y,or  z; 0.5 deg, roll, pitch, or yaw
 Other locations on tape: errors reduce toward inboard reference end, within range and sampling limitsMaximum data acquisition speed: 110 Hz
Included: Wall mount power supply (60 Hz, 120VAC), serial cable, interface box, and tape

Filters from Hong 
Linear has come out with a couple really nice switched cap 
filters that really cuts down on the design time: 
LTC1564 Tunable low pass filter 10kHz to 150kHz in steps of 
10kHz, 8 pole roll-off, programmable 1-16 gain, 3-10V operation. 
LTC1062 parallel 5-pole tunable low pass filter. Absolutely 
zero DC error because the input and output are connected directly with a wire and the filter damps out the high frequencies.</text>

Stretchy FSR strain sensors 
A novel strain sensor was used which was developed 
by EMP A, Switzerland [12]. The sensor thread consists 
of a commercial thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) filled with 
50wt-% carbon black powder and changes resistivity with 
length. It is fiber -shaped with a diameter of 0.3mm and 
has, therefore, the potential to be  fully integrated into textile. 
In this prototype setup, the sensor was attached with 
a silicone film (see Fig. 2) which enables a measurement 
range of 100% strain. The length of the sensor was chosen 
to be 2cm. Recognizing Upper Body Postures  using Textile Strain Sensors

Voltage Regulators 
 Series Regulators are simple often 3-terminal devices (in-gnd
out) that step an input voltage down to a lower (stable) reference 
voltage 
 Waste power dissipated = (V)(I) 
 Keep within device limits to avoid overheating 
 Maximum V ranges from approx. 100 mV to 3 V , depending on device, 
currents range from 100 mA to many Amperes 
 Switched Capacitor Regulators provide limited current w. 
minimal components, and can boost voltage. 
 Inductive switching regulators require external inductor and 
possibly other components, but can raise (boost) or lower (buck) 
voltage at very high (over 90%) efficiency.  Some regulators can 
switch from boost to buck to keep running as the battery dies 
 These regulators transform impedance 
 Many regulators of all types often include a battery low output

Noise Parameters 
 Sensor impedance will produce Johnson noise 
 Current and voltage modes 
 Signal-to-noise (dB) = 10 log10(Vs 2/Vn 2) 
 Noise figure is ratio (in dB) of the output noise of the real 
amplifier to the output noise of a zero-noise amplifier 
(only gain) with a given resistor Rs at the input. 
 Insensitive parameter for high Rs 
 Useful for a fixed, given impedance 
 RF device at 50  or a particular sensor 
 Equivalent to noise temperature (T of Rs to give noise in ideal 
amplifier) 
 Noise adds in quadrature (if sources are uncorrelated!)</text>

Guard Electrodes  
 On-Board Driven 
Shields to prevent 
crosstalk and coupling 
 Guards should be 
driven by a low-
impedance source close 
to the voltage on the 
electrodes to be 
guarded 
 E.g., a driven shield, or 
a ground in an inverting 
op-amp configuration

Digitization 
 Can use an analog-digital converter (ADC) 
 8-12 bit converters commonly on Computers 
 Sometimes 16 or 24 bit (Converter from Analog) 
 For special applications, one can use an ADC chip 
 Typically talk SPI, I2C, etc. 
 Many kinds of ADC 
 Pipeline, Successive Approximation, Flash,  
 Ari will tell you lots about how these work and their characteristics 
 For just 1 or 2 bits, you can use comparators 
 Comparitors often on C chip too 
 You can also convert an amplitude into a time signal 
 Only need a logic pin and a timing routine (or internal C timer) 
 Voltage to pulse-width, voltage to frequency 
 Can do current too!</text>

Sources of Noise in Electronics 
 Johnson (or Nyquist) Noise
 Flat spectrum 
Vnoise =  4kTR[f]  
 Independent of current 
 Comes from the fluxuation-dissipation theorem 
 Flicker Noise 
 1/f spectrum (equal power per decade of frequency) 
 Increases with current through element  Due to nonidealities (or granularity) in component 
Flicker noise in different 
kinds of resistors: Vnoise 10K resistor @ room temp develops 1.3 V over decade in frequency 
 
rms microvolts per volt applied across the resistor,  
measured over one decade of frequency: 
Carbon-composition               0.10V to 3.0V
Carbon-film                           0.05V to 0.3V
Metal-film                              0.2V to 0.2V
Wire-wound                           0.01V to 0.2V

Here is the low-power op amp I spec'ed out for my thesis and/or future 
Stack work: 
"...the Maxim MAX9911 is recommended. It is available in a single SC70 
package (5mm2) with shutdown, and has a turn on time of 30 us. Typical current draw is 4 uA with a shutdown draw of 1 nA. The gain bandwidth 
product of 200 kHz is acceptable for most uses."</text>
