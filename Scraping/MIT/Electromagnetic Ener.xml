          <text>In 1820, which rsted described as the happiest year of his 
life, rsted considered a lecture for his students focusing 
on electricity and magnetism that would involve a new 
electric battery. During a classroom demonstration, rsted 
saw that a compass needle deflected from magnetic north 
when the electric current from the battery was switched 
on or off. This deflection interestred rsted convincing him 
that magnetic fields might radiate from all sides of a live 
wire just as light and heat do. However, the initial reaction 
was so slight that rsted put off further research for three 
months until he began more intensive investigations. 
Shortly afterwards, rsted's findings were published, 
proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field 
as it flows through a wire. This discovery revealed the 
fundamental connection between electricity and 
magnetism, which most scientists thought to be completely 
unrelated phenomena.  
 
His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the 
scientific community in electrodynamics. The findings 
influenced French physicist Andr-Marie Ampre s 
developments of a single mathematical form to represent 
the magnetic forces between current -carrying conductors. 
rsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a 
unified concept of energy.

          <text>Magnetic Fields at Perfect Conductors 
Perfect conductors exclude magnetic fields.  Since normal          is 
continuous across a surface, there can be no normal           at the surface 
of a perfect conductor.  Thus, only tangential magnetic fields can be 
present at the surface.  They are terminated with surface currents.

          <text>Ampere invented the galvanometer. 
Schweigger used a coil (1821).   
Nobili improved on it in 1825 with  
two opposite magnets, one of which is in the coil. A galvanometer is a type of an electric current 
meter. It is an analog electromechanical 
transducer that produces a rotary deflection of 
some type of pointer in response to electric 
current flowing through its coil.

          <text>One might ask: 
If light can behave like a particle,
might particles act like waves ?
YES !
Particles, like photons, also have a wavelength given by:
de Broglie wavelength
The wavelength of a particle depends on its momentum, 
just like a photon!
The main difference is that matter particles have mass, 
and photons don t !

          <text>Classically , the minimum energy of the hydrogen atom is 
the state in which the electron is on top of the proton  
p = 0, r = 0.
Quantum mechanically, the uncertainty principle forces the electron to 
have non-zero momentum and non-zero expectation value of position. 
If ais an average distance electron-proton distance, 
the uncertainty principle informs us that the minimum electron 
momentum is on the order of /a.
The energy as a function of ais then:

accelerated, and an accelerating charge emits EM radiation (light).  
Classically, it can be calculated that the radiation of the electron 
would cause it to gradually loose its rotational kinetic energy and 
collapse on top of the proton within 10-9seconds !

          <text>Nobel Prize
 Alfred Nobel was born in1833 in Stockholm, 
Sweden. He was a chemist, engineer, and 
inventor. In 1894 Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he converted into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, most of it from his 355 inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.
 In 1888, Alfred was astonished to read his own 
obituary in a French newspaper. It was actually Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his to bequeathed 94% of his total assets (US$186 million in 2008) to establish the five Nobel Prizes. Today the Nobel Foundation has 
US$560 million.
 Winners receive a diploma, medal, and monetary 
award. In 2009, the monetary award was US$1.4 million.

A photon (quantum of light) is reflected from a 
mirror.
(A) Because a photon has a zero mass, it does not 
exert a force on the mirror.  
(B) Although the photon has energy, it cannot 
transfer any energy to the surface because it has zero mass. 
(C) The photon carries momentum, and when it 
reflects off the mirror, it undergoes a change in momentum and exerts a force on the mirror. 
(D) Although the photon carries momentum, its 
change in momentum is zero when it reflects from the mirror, so it cannot exert a force on the mirror.

          <text>Hendrik Lorentz (1853-1928) 
Nobel in 1902 for Zeeman Effec tLorentz Oscillator 
Lorentz was a late nineteenth century physicist, and quantum mechanics had not yet been 
discovered. However, he did understand the results of classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory. Therefore, he described the problem of atom-field interactions in these terms. Lorentz thought of an atom as a mass ( the nucleus ) connected to another smaller mass ( the electron ) by a spring. The spring would be set into motion by an 
electric field interacting with the charge of the electron. The field would either repel or 
attract the electron which would result in either compressing or stretching the spring. 
Lorentz was not positing the existence of  a physical spring connecting the electron to an atom; however, he did postulate that the force binding the two could be described by Hooke's Law:   
 
where y is the displacement from equilibrium. If Lorentz's system comes into contact with an electric field, then the electron will simply be displaced from equilibrium. The oscillating electric field of the electromagnetic wave will set the electron into harmonic motion. The effect of the magnetic field can be 
omitted because it is miniscule compared to the electric field.

TE solution comes directly from the boundary condition analysis 
2t cos i t cos i  i cos t t = r = t cos i + i cos t t cos i + i cos t 
TM solution comes from    
1 21 cos i  1 cos t cos i t i t r = t = 1 1 cos i + 1 cos t cos i + 1 cos t t i t i 
Note that the TM solution provides the reflection and transmission 
coefficients for H, since TM is the dual of TE.

Think of refraction as a pair of wheels on an axle going from a sidewalk 
onto grass. The wheel in the grass moves slower, so the direction of the wheel pair changes. 
Note that the wheels 
move faster (longer space) 
on the sidewalk, and slower 
(shorter space) in the grass.

Refraction involves a change in the direction of wave propagation 
due to a change in propagation speed. It involves the oblique incidence of waves on media boundaries, and hence wave propagation in at least two dimensions.

these superpositions represent quantum particles that are moving.  Consider: 
But what happens if we try to measure E on a wavefunction which involves more than one energy?   
We can still only measure one of the allowed energies
,  
i.e., one of the eigenstate energies (e.g., only E1 or E2 in (x,t) above)! 
If (x,t) is normalized, |A1|2 and |A2|2 give us the probabilities that

          <text>Lightning Rod 
When a conductive body 
contains sharp points, 
the electric field on 
these points is much 
stronger than that on the 
smooth part of the 
conducting body. 
 
Lighting Rods are connected to the ground. When a cloud 
carrying electric charges approaches, the rod attracts opposite 
charges from the ground.  The Electric field at the tip of the 
rod is much stronger than anywhere else.  When the E-field 
exceeds the  
air breakdown strength (of 33 kV/cm), charges start to travel 
to ground.

          <text>Gauss Law Tells Us   
 
 
 the electric charge can reside only on the surface of the conductor.  
 
[If charge was present inside a conductor, we can draw a Gaussian surface around 
that charge and the electric field in vicinity of that charge would be non-zero !   
A non-zero field implies current flow through the conductor, which will transport the 
charge to the surface.] 
 
 
 there is no charge at all on the inner surface of a hollow conductor.  
 
 
 that, if a charge carrying body has a sharp point, then the electric field at that 
point is much stronger than the electric field over the smoother part of the body. 
 
Lets show this by considering  
two spheres of different size, 
connected by a long, thin wire

frequency difference.  So when the slower wave goes 
through 5 full cycles (and is positive again), the faster 
wave goes through 5.5 cycles (and is negative).  Two waves at different frequencies  
     will constructively interfere and destructively interfere at different times

          <text>Phasor Notation for Uniform Plane Waves 
Imaginary numbers are noted differently in science and engineering disciplines. 
While scientists use I, engineers use j.  The relation between the two is as follows:  
Both scientists and engineers think that their version of the imaginary number is  
equal to         and independently, over time, they developed equations for identical 
 physical relations that can now only be reconciled if i is set to be equal to -j

A typical motor frequency of 2000 rpm satisfies  
EQS approximation for free-space 
         As another example, note: 
At 60 Hz, the wavelength (typical length) in air is 5000 km, therefore, almost all 
physical 60-Hz systems in air are quasistatic (since they are typically smaller than 
5000 km in size)

          <text>History of Snells Law 
 Snells Law describing refraction was first recorded by Ptolemy in 140 A.D 
 First described by relationship by Snellius in 1621 
 First explained in 1650 by Fermats principle of least time.

until the upper wheel re-enters the grass and wheel pair goes straight again  Total Internal Reflection in Suburbia 
Moreover, this wheel analogy is mathematically 
equivalent  to the refraction phenomenon.    
One can recover Snells law from it: n1 sin 1 = n2 sin 2 .

          <text>Note that the wheels 
move faster (longer space) 
on the sidewalk, and slower 
(shorter space) in the grass. Refraction in Suburbia 
Think of refraction as a pair of wheels on an axle going from a 
sidewalk onto grass.  The wheel in the grass moves slower,  
so the direction of the wheel pair changes.

Fermats principle of minimum time argues that light will travel from 
one point to another along a path that requires the minimum time.  
Applied to Reflection 
 A B 
B   
Since it is straight, the blue path is the shortest path from A to B.  So, the blue path 
is also the shortest reflecting path to B since it images the path to B.  For the blue path, the incidence and reflection angles equal.

1. For a solenoid, if we 
increase the number of loops NI 
N by 5% and increase the h 
height h by 5%, then the H-
field inside will not change. 
2. For a toroid, if we increase 
the number of loops N, but do NI 
2r not increase the radius, then 
the H-field inside stays the /vectorB
same. 
3. Lenzs Rule states that the induced E-field 
drives the current in the direction to try to 
keep the magnetic flux constant.

from Wikipedia 
Diamagnetic Materials 
Diamagnetism is the property of an object which causes it to create a magnetic field in opposition of an externally applied magnetic field, thus causing a repulsive effect. It is a form of magnetism that is 
only exhibited by a substance in the 
presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Diamagnetism is generally a quite weak effect in most materials, although superconductors exhibit a strong effect.

          <text>Ferromagnetic Materials 
 Why is there a B even when H is zero ?? 
 Why doesnt the magnetization change sign until HC ??  Impact that the imposition of a magnetic field H on a ferromagnetic material has on the resulting 
magnetic flux density B. The field causes the magnetic moments in each of the domains to begin to 
align. When the magnetizing force H is eliminated, the domains relax, but dont return to their 
original random orientation, leaving a remanent flux Br ; that is, the material becomes a permanent 
magnet. One way to demagnetize the material is to heat it to a high enough temperature (called 
the Curie temperature ) that the domains once again take on their random orientation. For iron, the 
Curie temperature is 770C.

Stimulated Emission :  If one photon is present it is more likely that an atom 
will emit a second identical photon!  In  a laser there is a cascade that causes 
emission of many identical photons! 
Two 
identical 
photons! Photon emitted by 
some other atomLasers
Identical photons with the same 
frequency moving in the same direction 
Result is a

          <text>Magnetic Flux Lines 
A magnetic pole sets up a magnetic field in the space around it that exerts a force on magnetic 
materials. The field can be visualized in terms of magnetic flux lines (similar to the lines of force of 
an electric field). These imaginary lines indicate the direction of the field in a given region. By convention they originate at the north pole of a magnet and form loops that end at the south pole either of the same magnet or of some other nearby magnet. The flux lines are spaced so that the 
number per unit area is proportional to the field strength in a given area. Thus, the lines converge 
near the poles, where the field is strong, and spread out as their distance from the poles increases. 
 A picture of these lines of induction can be made by sprinkling iron filings on a piece of paper placed over a magnet. The individual pieces of iron become magnetized by entering a magnetic field, i.e., they act like tiny magnets, lining themselves up along the lines of induction.

          <text>Worked Example 
A screen contains two slits distance d = 0.100 mm apart and  
is length L = 1.20 m from a viewing screen. Monochromatic 
light of wavelength  = 500 nm falls on the slits from a 
distant source.  
 
About how far apart x = x2-x1 will the bright interference 
fringes be on the screen?  
Answer: About 6 mm.  Use small angle approximations  
to simplify algebra, avoid using sine and tan functions.

          <text>Interference Preconditions 
1.Light must be monochromatic , i.e., involve  
just a single frequency (single wavelength). 
2.Light sources must be coherent ,  
the relative phase is always the same. 
3.Light sources must have the same amplitudes . 
 
If these conditions do not hold, one still gets 
constructive and destructive interference but the 
interference pattern can change with time or not be 
complete (destructive interference leads to a 
decrease in amplitude but not to zero amplitude).

          <text>Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum
 
Mechanics
 
	 A system is completely described by a wave function , representing an 
observer's subjective knowledge of the system. 
	 The description of nature is essentially probabilistic, with the probability of an 
event related to the square of the amplitude of the wave function related to it. 
	 It is not possible to know the value of all the properties of the system at the same time; those properties that are not known with precision must be 
described by probabilities. (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) 
	 Matter exhibits a waveparticle duality. An experiment can show the particle-
like properties of matter, or the wave-like properties; in some experiments 
both of these complementary viewpoints must be invoked to explain the 
results. 
	 Measuring devices are essentially classical devices, and measure only 
classical properties such as position and momentum. 
	 The quantum mechanical description of large systems will closely approximate the classical description.</text>

EM Field of light causes vibration of the matter it interacts with.  The mater is 
polarized along the same direction as the EM wave  leading to re-radiation of light by polarized matter.  (This is why skylight is polarized.) 
Malus' law : when a perfect 
polarizer is placed in a polarized beam of light, the intensity, I, of the light that EM Waves can be linearly, circularly, or 
passes through is given by elliptically polarized. 
  
 
2 A linearly polarized wave can be represented as 
 I=Iocosa sum of two circularly polarized waves. 
   
where I0 is the initial intensity, 
and  is the angle between the 
light's initial plane of 
polarization and the axis of the 
polarizer.

          <text>Wire-grid Polarizer 
 converts an unpolarized beam into 
one with a single linear polarization  
The wire-grid polarizer  consists of a regular array of parallel 
metallic wires, placed in a plane perpendicular to the incident beam.  
Electromagnetic waves  with electric fields aligned parallel  to the wires induce the 
movement of electrons along the length of the wires. Since the electrons are free 
to move, the polarizer behaves in a similar manner as the surface of a metal when reflecting light; some energy is lost due to Joule heating in the wires, and the rest of the wave is reflected backwards along the incident beam. 
Electromagnetic waves  with electric fields aligned perpendicular  to the wires, the 
electrons cannot move very far across the width of each wire; therefore, little 
energy is lost or reflected, and the incident wave is able to travel through the grid.  
Therefore, the transmitted wave  has an electric field purely in the direction 
perpendicular to the wires, and is thus linearly polarized.

Dichroism of Materials 
Dichroism in materials refers to the phenomenon when light 
rays having different polarizations are absorbed by different amounts. 
Polaroid sheet polarizers 
were developed by Edwin Land 
in 1929 using herapathite.  Herapathite, or iodoquinine dichroic glass jewelry 
sulfate, is a chemical compound whose crystals are dichroic 
and thus can be used for polarizing light. 
According to Edwin H. Land, herapathite was discovered In 1852 by William 
Herapath, a doctor in Bristol.  One of his pupils found that adding iodine to the urine of a dog that had been fed quinine produced unusual green crystals.  
Herapath noticed while studying the crystals under a microscope that they 
appeared to polarize light. 
Land in 1929 to construct the first type of Polaroid sheet polarizer. He did this 
by embedding herapathite crystals in a polymer instead of growing a single large crystal. Land established Polaroid Corporation in 1937 in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. The company initially produced Polaroid Day Glasses, the first 
sunglasses with a polarizing filter.

If two polarizers are placed one after another (the second polarizer is generally called an 
analyzer), the mutual angle between their polarizing axes gives the value of  in Malus' 
law
. If the two axes are orthogonal, the polarizers are crossed  and in theory no light is 
transmitted, though again practically speaking no polarizer is perfect and the transmission 
is not exactly zero (for example, crossed Polaroid sheets appear slightly blue in color).  
 
Real polarizers are also not perfect blockers of the polarization orthogonal to their 
polarization axis; the ratio of the transmission of the unwanted component to the wanted 
component is called the extinction ratio , and varies from around 1:500 for Polaroid to 
about 1:106 for Glan-Taylor prism polarizers. 
Crossed Polarizers 
In practice, some light is lost in the polarizer and the actual transmission of unpolarized 
light will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarizers.

electric dipole moment, p (or electric dipole  for short), is a measure of the polarity of a 
system of electric charges.   Here x is the displacement vector pointing from the negative 
charge to the positive charge. This implies that the electric dipole moment vector points from 
the negative charge to the positive charge. Note that the electric field lines run away from the 
positive charge and toward the negative charge. There is no inconsistency here, because the 
electric dipole moment has to do with the positions of the charges, not the field lines. small

PHYSICALLY MEANINGFUL STATES MUST HAVE THE FOLLOWING PROPERTIES:
(x) must be single-valued, and finite
(finite to avoid infinite probability density)
(x) must be continuous, with finite d /dx
(because d /dx is related to the momentum density)
In regions with finite potential, d/dx must be continuous 
(with finite d2/dx2, to avoid infinite energies)
There is usually no significance to the overall sign of (x)
(it goes away when we take the absolute square)
(In fact, (x,t) is usually complex !)

Max Planck
 Planck was a gifted musician. He played piano, organ and 
cello, and composed songs and operas.
 The Munich physics professor Jolly advised Planck against 
going into physics, saying, in this field, almost everything is 
already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few 
holes.
 In 1877 he went to Berlin for a year of study with physicists 
Helmholtz and Kirchhoff. He wrote that Kirchhoff spoke in 
carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. 
He eventually became Kirchhoff s successor in Berlin.
 The concept of the photon was initially rejected by Planck. 
He wrote "The theory of light would be thrown back not by 
decades, but by centuries, into the age when Christian Huygens dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of 
Isaac Newton. 
 In his Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, he stated 
Planck's Principle, which holds that "A new scientific truth 
does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar 
with it "

The Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation  
The ionosphere is important for radio wave (AM only) propagation.... 
Ionosphere is composed of the D, E, and F layers. 
The D layer is good at absorbing AM radio waves. 
 D layer disappears at night...the E and F layers bounce the waves back to the Earth. 
 This explains why radio stations adjust their power output at sunset and sunrise.

Plasma is an ionized gas consisting of positively charged molecules (ions) and 
negatively charged electrons that are free to move. 
 
Plasma exists naturally in what we call ionosphere (80 km ~ 120 km above the 
surface of the Earth).  Here the UV light from the Sun ionizes air molecules.

Dipole Moment =   p /vector=/vectorx
electric dipole moment, p (or electric dipole  for short), is a measure of the polarity of a 
system of electric charges.  Here x is the displacement vector pointing from the negative 
charge to the positive charge. This implies that the electric dipole moment vector points from 
the negative charge to the positive charge. Note that the electric field lines run away from the positive charge and toward the negative charge. There is no inconsistency here, because the electric dipole moment has to do with the positions of the charges, not the field lines. small

          <text>Dielectric Breakdown 
 is similar to ionization of air. 
In the insulating region of a capacitor, there is a small number of free electrons due 
to impurities and other defects.  These electrons are accelerated by the electric field and collide with the lattice structure.  If the field strength is high enough, the electron generates more electrons with collision, resulting in a avalanche effect or a large current.

          <text>Why do we make a special symbol, Q, to distinguish heat energy flow from the 
other types of energy that could flow into or out of the system? 
  
Heat is a special energy flow 
  
All o
f the other types of flow are flows of energy, e.g., measured in joules.  
  
Heat flow, which also can be measured in joules, affects the universe in a 
special way.  It  increases the vibrational energy of the materials in which it 
flows.  Extra vibrational energy in atoms leads to randomness  or disorder in 
the material structure.  This disorder is called entropy . Generation or flow 
of heat is unique in that it increases entropy.  Heat flow always increases 
entropy when real (lossy, with friction, resistance, etc.) systems are involved. 
  
The entropy of a lump of material may apparently be lowered, e.g., by 
cooling the material.  This apparent reduction in entropy always occurs at the 
expense of a greater increase in entropy somewhere else.  That is, your 
refrigerator may cool your bubbly beverage, lowering the entropy of the 
drink.  However, the entropy of your kitchen, where the heat from the 
beverage is transferred by the refrigerator, will increase more than the 
reduction of entropy in the beverage.

          <text>A typical farm horse, for example, can pull harder and make a 
heavy stone block move at a higher velocity than a typical person.   
  The horse is more powerful than the person.  
 
James Watt studied energy conversion by observing the work of a 
horse (mine pony) in  lifting coal out of a coal mine.  He  found that, 
on the average, a mine pony could pull (lift by means of a pulley) 
22,000 foot-pounds per minute. Rather than call this "pony" power, 
he increased these test results by 50 percent, and called it 
horsepower (hp)  i.e. 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute.

R. D. Stevenson and R. J. Wasserzug published an article in 
Nature 364, 195-195 (15 July 1993) calculating the upper limit 
to an animal's power output. The peak power over a few 
seconds has been measured to be as high as 14.9 hp. However, 
for longer periods an average horse produces less than one 
horsepower. - Wikipedia

          <text>The SECOND LAW of thermodynamics states that  
a net increase in the entropy of the universe  
always accompanies heat flow in practical systems 
  
As with the first law, there are a number of different ways to state the 
second law.  
  
A practical consequence of the second law is that any practical machine 
that converts energy from one form to another, e.g., a motor that 
converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, will have an efficiency 
of conversion less than unity. That is, the efficiency or the ratio of 
mechanical power OUT divided by electrical power IN will be less than 
one.  Any heat flow generated by inevitable real world loss mechanisms 
like friction and resistance will lead to unrecoverable energy losses 
during the conversion process. 
  
Because heat flow is also associated with changes in entropy, it receives 
a special symbol, Q.  Some energy conversion systems, like a refrigerator 
or a steam engine, are designed to make use of or to affect heat flows in 
their conversion process.

          <text>Other practical systems, like electric motors or generators, inevitably generate 
some heat, but only as an unfortunate, inevitable consequence of losses in  the 
conversion process. For this second class of systems, we will often choose to 
mentally move  the heat generating loss mechanisms out of the box  that 
describes the system, so that we can focus on the pure conversion from one non-
heat energy flow (e.g., electrical energy from a battery) to another non-heat 
energy flow (e.g., mechanical speed of a motor shaft). 
 
 
For example, we might model a motor this way:

          <text>If we consider the total system, we have to account for the heat transfers in applying the 
first law. That is, we need an equation with Ws and Qs. 
  
If we focus on the lossless  motor,  then we  can look at equations that just involve Ws.  
Of course, we  have to  be careful to  focus on  the right  Ws,  the energy flows that occur 
after we pay  for the resistive losses and before  we pay  for the friction losses.  Done 
carefully, this focus on the lossless motor will let us study the pure  conversion process 
from one domain (electrical) to  another (mechanical).  In a practical system, we  must 
remember that, after studying the lossless system, the losses must also be  accounted.

          <text>The ports of many energy conversion systems are conveniently described by a set of 
through and across measurements or variables.  The different types of through  
and across variables distinguish different types of engineers  
(electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc.).  The first and second laws apply to everyone. 
  
ACROSS variables typically measure how hard we are pushing.  
 Typical across variables include:  
  
Force , from mechanical engineering, measured in Newtons   (N = kg*m/(s*s )) 
Voltage, from electrical engineering, measured in volts (V) 
Torque, or twisting force, from mechanical engineering, measured in N-m 
Pressure,  from ocean/aero engineering, measured in N/(m*m) 
  
Associated THROUGH variables typically measure how much stuff is flowing:  
  
Velocity, from mechanical engineering, measured in meters/sec (m/s) 
Current, from electrical engineering, measured in Coulombs/sec or Amps 
Angular Velocity, from mechanical engineering, measured in rads/sec 
Flow, from ocean/aero engineering, measured in volume/sec or m*m*m/s

          <text>The FIRST LAW of thermodynamics  governs the behavior of  
energy conversion systems.  This law is not provable.   
It is an accepted observation of how the universe always works. 
  
Ignoring nuclear reactions, in which energy can be converted to mass  
and vice-versa, the first law of thermodynamics says: 
  
Energy is conserved 
  
There are a number of equivalent ways to make this same statement. If the 
various energy flows W (electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc.) are all 
measured to be positive  quantities when flowing OUT of the system (i.e., 
positive when the system is acting as a source)  and Q is understood to be 
positive  when flowing IN to the system (by thermodynamic convention), 
then the first law can also be written as: 
 
This statement of the first law says that the energy stored in the system is 
equal to the difference between the heat flowing IN to the system and the 
sum of all of the other energy flows OUT of the system.

The First Law of Thermodynamics is never violated 
Heat is simply the vibration of atoms, with vibrations transferable to other 
surfaces 
Friction originates from interaction of atoms on surfaces 
The Second Law of Thermodynamics necessitates that any practical machine 
that converts energy from one form to another will have an efficiency of 
conversion that is less than unity (for example electrical motor). 
 
Product of Through and Across variables is Power  
1 kW-hr = 3.6 MJ 
 
Solar energy is abundant, but seldom used due to the low energy density of 
the solar flux, that makes solar energy capture relatively expensive.

 Todays Culture Moment  
James Prescott Joule was an English physicist and 
brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. Joule studied the 
nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work. This led to the theory of conservation of energy, which led to the development of the first law 
of thermodynamics. The SI derived unit of energy, the 
joule, is named after him. He worked with William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) to develop the absolute scale of temperature.

What is energy?   
Energy is the ability to do useful work.  It is the ability to 
move something, heat something, grind something, light 
something   
 
All other engineering disciplines study energy conversion 
they just choose different energy inputs and outputs

          <text>Power  is a very old and basic concept  
 for any moving, living being on the earth.  
 
Power is the product of an across variable and a through variable.   
 
In more colloquial terms, it is a composite metric or product of  
how hard were pushing (the across variable) and  
how much is flowing in response to the pushing (the through variable).   
  
 
FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
 - Mechanical power is force  times velocity . 
  
 - Electrical power is voltage  times current. 
  
Power, whether electrical, mechanical, or in some other discipline, 
is measured in units of Watts in the SI/MKS system.

          <text>Another way to  describe the first law is by considering a closed  cycle  of 
operation of the system.  The definition of a closed cycle of operation is a 
sequence or pattern of system behaviors that start and end at the same 
system state.  That is, over a closed cycle of operation, the change in stored 
energy is zero.  In this case, we  can express the first law this way: 
 
     
 
    
 
 
  
That is, the 
sum of all of  the infinitesimal flows of heat energy into a system 
over a closed cycle of operation must be offset by an equivalent sum of  
infinitesimal work flows out of the system over the cycle in order for the net 
change in stored energy to be zero.

          <text>Dielectric Mirrors 
  can be &gt;99% reflective 
Simple dielectric mirrors consist of 
stacked of layers of high and low 
refractive index. The layers are chosen 
such the path-length differences of 
reflections from low to high index layers 
are integer multiples of wavelengths.  
Similarly, reflections from low-index layers 
have path length difference of half a 
wavelength, but add constructively 
because of 180 degree phase shift from 
the reflection.  For normal incidence, 
these optimized thicknesses are a quarter 
of a wavelength 1 b2 d1=/(4nhi)
Nn =LO
R  b=i=0n /(4n1+bd= lo) 2HI
Thin layers with a high refractive index nHI 
are interleaved with thicker layers with a 
lower refractive index nLO.  
The path lengths lA and lB differ by 
exactly one wavelength, which leads to 
constructive interference.

          <text>Uniaxial Crystal 
Uniaxial crystals  have one 
refractive index for light 
polarized along the optic axis (ne) 
 
and another for light polarized in 
either of the two directions 
perpendicular to it ( no).   
 
Light polarized along the optic axis 
is called the extraordinary  ray,  
 
and light polarized perpendicular to 
it is called the ordinary  ray.  
 
These polarization directions are 
the crystal principal axes .

          <text>Batteries 
In 1780, Luigi Galvani discovered that when two different metals (copper and zinc for example) 
were connected together and then both touched to different parts of a nerve of a frog leg at the 
same time, they made the leg contract. He called this "animal electricity". The Voltaic pile invented by Alessandro Volta in the 1800s is similar to the galvanic cell. These discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries. 
Capacity of Batteries: 
 
AAA  1250 mAh 
AA  2850 mAh 
C  8350 mAh 
D  20500 mAh 
 
iPhone  1400 mAh @3.7V 
 
The more electrolyte and electrode material there is in the cell, the greater the capacity of the cell. 
Thus a small cell has less capacity than a larger cell, given the same chemistry  
(e.g. alkaline cells), though they develop the same open-circuit voltage.  
The more electrolyte and electrode material there is in the cell, the greater the capacity of the cell. 
From Wikipedia article on the Galvanic cell.

          <text>Hypothetical Gas-Powered Go-Cart: 
 
Lets make a comparison to a similar go -cart powered by a reasonably sized gasoline 
engine and gas tank.  Lets replace the 36 pounds of batteries by a gas tank that holds  
36 pounds of gasoline.  
 -  Gasoline weighs 6 pounds per gallon,  
 -   Gasoline stores 40,000 Watt-hours of heat energy per gallon.  That is, if you  
     burned a gallon of gasoline, you would get 40,000 Watt-hours worth of heat.    
    
How many joules are stored in a gallon 
of gasoline?                                                                                    144,000,000 J    How many gallons of gas are stored in the

Phlogiston 
Phlogiston 
The remarkable thing about this amazing theory was that it 
seemed to have worked, and it had been used by eminent and respected early scientists for an entire century before it was 
finally proven wrong.Phlogiston theory was perhaps the most 
persistent, widespread, and totally wrong mistake made by scientists all through the age when science, as we know it today, was developed.  
Fawcett, 100 Mistakes that Changed History  
The element that was heat 
itself. This idea was perpetuated by Georg Stahl and was widespread in use by 
scientists in the 1700s.

          <text>When motor turns it generates Back EMF  
 The 1st Law requires that any contraption that can be used as an 
electromechanical actuator can use its actuation to generate EM fields: 
 - a motor can also be used as a generator. 
 - a loudspeaker can also be used as a microphone 
  Torque of a motor = motor constant  motor current 
  When frictional torque in a motor equals the morque from the Lorentz force 
inside the motor, the net torque is zero and a steady operation is achieved.  Frictional Torque = constant  angular velocity 
 
 Operated at CONSTANT CURRENT  motors have steady torque 
 Operated at CONSTANT VOLTAGE  motors have steady angular velocity 
 
 Energy stored in 1 gallons of gasoline is 35 kW-hr (or rounding-up 40 kW-hr) 
 Electric vehicles are more economical per mile traveled, however, they can 
travel fewer miles since the batteries store less energy per kg than fuel does

          <text>Optoelectric   Tweezers
Transforms optical energy to electrical energy through the 
use of a photoconductive surface. The idea is similar to 
that used in the ubiquitous office copier machine. In xerography, a document is scanned and transferred onto a photosensitive drum, which attracts dyes of carbon particles that are rolled onto a piece of paper to reproduce  
the image. 
 In this case, the researchers use a photosensitive surface made of amorphous silicon, a common material used in solar cells and flat-panel displays. Microscopic polystyrene 
particles suspended in a liquid were sandwiched between a 
piece of glass and the photoconductive material. Wherever light would hit the photosensitive material, it would behave like a conducting electrode, while areas not exposed to light would behave like a non-conducting

 Depending upon the properties of the particles or cells 
being studied, they will either be attracted to or repelled 
by the electric field generated by the optoelectronic tweezer. Either way, the researchers can use that behavior to scoot particles where they want them to go.

          <text>So is Light a 
Wave or a Particle ?  
 
Light is always both 
Wave and Particle !  
On macroscopic scales, large number of photons look 
like they exhibit only wave phenomena.  
 
A single photon is still a wave, but your act of trying to 
measure it makes it look like a localized particle.

1.The photoelectric effect was used to show that light 
was composed of packets of energy proportional to 
its frequency. 
2.The number of photons present in a beam of light is simply the intensity I divided by the photon energy 
h. 
3.Infrared light at a wavelength of 1.24 microns has photon energy of 1.5 eV.

the collision behaves just as if it were two billiard balls colliding ! 
(with total momentum always conserved)  In 1924, A. H. Compton performed an experiment 
where X-rays impinged on matter,  
and he measured the scattered radiation. 
It was found that the scattered

          <text>Electron Microscope
This image was taken with a  
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). 
 
SEM can resolve features as small as 5 nm. 
This is about 100 times better than can be 
done with visible light microscopes! The electron microscope  is a device which uses the 
wave behavior of electrons  to make images  
which are otherwise too small for visible light!  
IMPORTANT POINT : 
High energy particles can be used to reveal the structure of matter !

Photons have energy and a finite velocity so there 
must be some momentum associated with photons !

          <text>Manifestation of the Photon Momentum 
Conservation of linear 
momentum implies that an 
atom recoils when it 
undergoes spontaneous 
emission.  The direction of 
photon emission (and atomic 
 recoil) is not predictable.

A source emitting a spherical 
wave cannot recoil, because

(x) must be single-valued, and finite
(finite to avoid infinite probability density)
(x) must be continuous, with finite d/dx
(because d /dx is related to the momentum density)
In regions with finite potential, d/dx must be continuous 
(with finite d2/dx2, to avoid infinite energies)
There is usually no significance to the overall signof (x)
(it goes away when we take the absolute square)

1. Destructive interference occurs when two waves are 
offset by a phase of m, or half a wavelength. 
2. The intensity of a plane wave oscillates in time. This 
means it is always constructively and destructively interfering with itself. 
3. In a double-slit 
experiment, as you decrease the space between the slits, the interference peaks decrease proportionally. Propagation

(Valence band) 
The electrons in a filled band  cannot contribute to conduction,  
because with reasonable E fields they cannot be promoted to a higher kinetic energy.  
  Therefore, at T = 0, Si is an insulator.  At higher temperatures, however, electrons are 
thermally promoted into the conduction band.

          <text>Question:  
If we use a solenoid with twice the cross-sectional area, but the same 
magnetic flux density (same magnitude of I1), what is the magnitude of I2 ? 
We can build the solenoid with the 
larger cross-sectional area, 2*A, out 
of two solenoids with the initial cross-
sectional area, A.  Each of the smaller 
solenoids would induce current I2,  
so by superposition, for the twice-as-
big solenoid the current would be  
twice-as-big !

          <text>Manifestation of the Photon Momentum
SOURCE EMITTING A PHOTON
Conservation of linear 
momentum implies that an 
atom recoils when it 
undergoes spontaneous 
emission.  The direction of 
photon emission (and atomic 
recoil) is not predictable. 
A well-collimated atomic 
beam of excited atoms 
will spread laterally 
because of the recoil 
associated with 
spontaneous emission. 
SOURCE EMITTING AN EM WAVE
A source emitting a spherical 
wave cannot recoil, because 
the spherical symmetry of 
the wave prevents it from 
carrying any linear 
momentum from the source. excited atom

          <text>QUICK QUIZ
A photon (quantum of light) is reflected from a 
mirror. 
 so is the following True or False : 
FALSE (A) Because a photon has a zero mass, it does not exert a force on the mirror.  
FALSE (B) Although the photon has energy, it cannot transfer any energy to the surface because it has zero mass. 
TRUE (C) The photon carries momentum, and when it reflects off the mirror, it undergoes a change in momentum and exerts a force on the mirror. 
FALSE (D) Although the photon carries momentum, its change in momentum is zero when it reflects from the mirror, so it cannot exert a force on the mirror.

X-ray Crystalography 
The incoming beam (coming from upper left) causes each scatterer to re-
radiate a small portion of its energy as a spherical wave. If scatterers are 
arranged symmetrically with a separation d, these spherical waves will be 
in synch (add constructively) only in directions where their path-length 
difference 2d sin  equals an integer multiple of the wavelength . In that  
case, part of the incoming beam is deflected by an angle 2 , producing a 
reflection spot in the diffraction pattern.

          <text>Faradays Law for a Coil from Chabay and Sherwood, Ch 22 
Will the current run 
CLOCKWISE or ANTICLOCKWISE ? Rotating a bar of magnet (or the coil) 
produces a time-varying magnetic field 
inside the coil 
Moving a magnet towards a coil produces a 
time-varying magnetic field inside the coil 
6
The induced emf in a coil of N turns is equal to  
N times the rate of change of the magnetic flux on one loop of the coil.</text>

          <text>Amperes Law Revisited 
In the case of the magnetic field we can see that our old Amperes law can 
not be the whole story. Here is an example in which current does not gives 
rise to the magnetic field: 
Consider the case of charging up a capacitor C which is connected to very long wires.  
The charging current is I. From the symmetry it is easy to see that an application of 
Amperes law will produce B fields which go in circles around the wire and whose 
magnitude is B(r) = oI/(2r). But there is no charge flow in the gap across the capacitor 
plates and according to Amperes law the B field in the plane parallel to the capacitor 
plates and going through the capacitor gap should be zero!  This seems unphysical.

What is the emf over the resistor ? 
demf=mag
In a short time t  the bar moves a 
distance x = v*t, and the flux 
increases by mag = B (L v* t) 
There is an increase in flux through the circuit 
as the bar of length L moves to the right 
(orthogonal to magnetic field H) at velocity, v.

remains transparent. 
When switched ON voltage drives the ions from  
the ion storage layer, through the ion conducting  
layer and into the  electrochromi c layer. Oxidation  
reactio n -- a reaction in which molecules in a 
compound lose an electron changes the dielectric  
properties of the  electrochromi c layer, which now 
absorbs the incident light, are what allow it to 
change from opaque to transparent. It's these ions 
that allow it to absorb light. By shutting off the  
voltage, the ions are driven out of the  
electrochromi c layers and into the ion storage  
layer. When the ions leave the  electrochromi c layer,  
the window regains its transparency.

Maxwells equations are partial differential equations, 
and hence involve signals that are functions of space 
and their spatial derivates.  Correspondingly, we will find 
complex exponential functions of the form 
 
 
to be very useful in analyzing dynamic systems described 
with Maxwell s equations.

Can we always find roots of a polynomial?  The equation 
 
has no solution for     in the set of real numbers.  If we define, 
and then use, a number that satisfies the equation 
 
that is,             or 
then we can always find the n roots of a polynomial of degree n. 
Complex roots of a characteris tic polynomial are associated with 
an oscillatory (sinusoidal) natural response.

          <text>The Challenge of  Sinusoids 
Models of dynamic systems couple time signals to their 
time derivatives.  For example, consider the system 
 
 
  Where    is a constant.  Suppose that        is sinusoidal, 
then        and its time derivative will take the form 
 
 
         
 
Coupling the signal        to its time derivative will involve trigonometric identities which are cumbersome!  Are there better analytic tools?  (Yes, for linear systems.)
