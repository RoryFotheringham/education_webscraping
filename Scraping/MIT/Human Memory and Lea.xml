II. Principles of Encoding 
 
 
Episodic Memory 
Primary memory 
 
the knowledge of a former state of mind after it has already once dropped from 
consciousness; or rather it is the knowledge of an event, or fact, of which we have not 
been thinking, with the additional consciousness that we have thought or experienced it 
before.      W. James (1890) 
 
Episodic memory 
 
memory for a specific event that occurred in a specific time and place (i.e., spatio-
temporal context)       Tulving (1972) 
 
Episodic Encoding 
Processes that yield a durable memory trace such  that an event can be subsequently 
consciously remembered

          <text>Motor sequence learning  
 
But motor skill learning is sometimes impaired in amnesia 
 Maze learning 
 Higher-order motor sequence learning 
 Exceptions may require higher-order  relational or spatial learning 
 
 
Other forms are spared:  
 Mirror-tracing 
 
BG may play particular ro le in open-loop motor skills 
 
Imaging shows increasing putamen ac tivity with motor skill acquisition 
 
Neuropsychology:  
 cerebellar lesions sometimes impair motor learning 
 pattern tracing (Sanes, Dimitrov, &amp; Hallett, 1990) 
 
Imaging:  
 decreased cerebellar activation with ac quisition of very simple motor tasks 
 cerebellar activation related to errors on motor tasks 
 
Neurophysiology: 
 Increased # of synapses in cerebellar co rtex accompanies motor skill learning in 
rats (Greenough et al.) 
 
Neuropsychology:   
 Little evidence about role of co rtex in memory for motor skills 
 SMA lesions impair SRT and tracking 
 Evaluation of role of motor cortex is difficult 
 Motor control impairments following cortical lesions 
 Cortical lesions are often large 
 
Neuroanatomy: 
 Size of motor cortex is correlated with l ong-term motor skill acquisition (Amunts et 
al., 1997) 
 
Neurophysiology: 
 changes in cortical maps with skill learning 
 areal expansion for trained movements

          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>Strengths: 
 Makes detailed behavioral predictions 
 Predicts power function speedup 
 
Weaknesses: 
 Has primarily been applied to verbal cognitive tasks 
 Not clear that declarative-to-procedural tran sition is a valid desc riptor of all types 
of skill acquisition 
 
 
Instance/exemplar-based memory 
 Each episode results in a memory trace containing the cont ents of attention 
 Each instance retrieves all similar traces from memory 
 
Race between memory and algorithm 
 Performance initially driven by algorithm (or analogy) 
 Memory retrieval time decreases as power function of number of instances stored in 
memory 
 Memory retrieval soon comes to dominate performance 
 Even when average memory retrieva l time is longer than algorithm time 
 
 
Strengths: 
 Predicts changing shape of response time distributions with learning 
 
Weaknesses: 
 Current incarnation only models response times 
 Does not make behavioral predictions 
 
Skill learning is tested in a number of domains 
 Motor skill 
 Perceptual skill 
 Cognitive skill 
 
Novel perceptual-motor mappings 
 Mirror-tracing 
 Prism adaptation 
 
Novel movement patterns / sequences 
 Rotary pursuit 
 Motor sequence learning 
 
Motor skill learning is usually intact in amnesia

Non-declarative Memory:  Skill Learning 
 
 Characteristics of skill learning 
 
 Theories of skill learning 
 ACT-* 
 Instance theory 
 
 Varieties of skill learning 
 Motor skill 
 Perceptual skill 
 Cognitive skill 
 
Acquisition of new behavioral  abilities with practice 
 
Contrast with repetition priming: 
 
 Repetition priming is defined as facilitation on a particular stimulus 
 
 Skill learning is defined as facilitation on a range of stimuli in a particular task 
 
1) Cognitive stage 
 Initial (often verbal) characterizati on of skill used to guide behavior 
 Requires working memory capacity 
 
2) Associative stage 
 Behavior becomes tuned, errors are eliminated 
 Verbal mediation drops out 
 
3) Autonomous stage 
 Gradual continued improvement of skill 
 Little reliance upon working memory

          <text>Learning impaired foll owing frontal lesions 
 
Probabilistic clas sification learning 
 Learning impaired in PD and HD  
 Imaging shows activation of caudate nuc leus which decreases with learning 
 Learning intact following frontal lesions 
 
Skill learning is (mostly) independent of MTL 
 
Basal ganglia are involved in  a wide range of skills 
 
Different cortical regions importa nt depending upon nature of skill 
 
Cerebellum important for motor skills 
 
Two ways that the brain changes during skill learning 
 
 Tuning of existing processes/representations 
 Existing representations are dynamically altered 
 
 Switching to new proces ses/representations 
 Task is performed in a completely different manner 
 May reflect race/competition between multiple processes</text>

Intact mirror-reading  
in amnesia 
 
Neuropsychology: 
 HD patients mildly impaired at mirror-reading skill 
 PD patients are variably impaired 
 Some studies find severe impairment 
 Others find no impairment 
 
Neuroimaging: 
 Imaging shows learning-related changes in caudate 
 
 
Frontal, occipital, and cerebellar lesions do not impair mirror-reading

          <text>Less attention-demanding 
 Reduced interference with other ongoing processes or tasks 
 Reduced need for conscious control 
 
However, automaticity does not imply that behavior is uncontrollable 
 Many examples of skill (driving, reading, typing) are highly cont rollable, in that 
they can be stopped at any time 
 
 
Decrease in response times with skill learning on a wide range of tasks can be described 
by a power function: 
  
RT = A + BN - 
 
A=asymptote 
B=startasymptote 
-=learning rate 
 
 
Production system model of memory 
 If-then rules triggered by contents of working memory 
 
Learning involves transition from de clarative to procedural memory 
 
Declarative stage:  
 Existing productions ar e chained together  
 Relevant information is held in working memory 
 
Procedural stage:  
 Multiple productions are chained into single productions with declarative 
knowledge built in 
 decreases working memory requirements 
 New compiled productions are strengthened 
 
Goal: Type the word hot 
Variables:    L1=h, L2=o, L3=t 
Productions: 
 If the goal is to type a word &amp; the 1st letter of the word is L1, 
 Then type L1 
 If the goal is to type a word &amp; th e 2nd letter of the word is L2, 
 Then type L2 
 If the goal is to type a word &amp; th e 3rd letter of the word is L3, 
 Then type L3 
 
After practice, composition and procedural ization lead to the following production: 
 If the goal is to type hot , type h, o, and t</text>

Imaging Memory in Humans  
Hemodynamic measures (indirect) 
 PET 
 indexes changes in blood flow correlated w/ neural activity 
 strengths:  can index metabolism and receptor density 
 limits:  radiation; cost; low temporal and spatial resolution 
 
 fMRI 
 indexes changes in blood oxygenation levels correlated w/ activity 
 strengths: non-invasive; high spatial reso lution; individual or group analyses; 
permits event-related designs 
 limits: temporal resolution restricted by hemodynamic response

Neuroimaging Approaches  
Binary comparisons 
 full- vs. divided-attention during episodic encoding   (e.g., Shallice et al., 1994) 
 
 deep vs. shallow processing during epis odic encoding (e.g., Kapur et al., 1994) 
 
 phonological store and rehearsal vs. rehearsal        (e.g., Paulesu et al., 1993) 
 
Subtractive / Hierarchical Logic  
Neuroimaging Approaches:  Subtractive Logic  
Issues to consider 
 subtractive logic -- assumption of pure insertion 
 requires well-designed paradigms and correct task analyses 
 assumes processes do not interact  
Parametric Designs  
Systematically vary the levels of one factor 
 e.g., varying working memory load (e.g., Braver et al., 1997)

          <text>What is Memory?  
Memory properis the knowledge of a former  state of mind after it has already once 
dropped from consciousness; or rather it is  the knowledge of an event, or fact,  of which 
meantime we have not been thinking, with the additional consciousness that we have 
thought or experienced it before. 
Forms of Memory
