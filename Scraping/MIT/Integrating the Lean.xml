4. Gather data 
Identify resources for each task and flow 
5. Create the Current State map 
6. Analyze current conditions 
Identify value added and w aste 
Reconfigure process to elim inate w aste and m axim ize 
value 
7. Visualize Ideal State
8. Create the Future State map

Involve entire team 
Actually walk the process - follow the 
material and information through the 
process, starting at the beginning 
Use post-it notes and butcher paper 
Use symbols or icons that are meaningful to 
the process but common enough to be 
understood by all involved</text>

 Remember that value stream mapping &amp; analysis is 
a process 
 Avoid short-cuts the steps are important! 
 Remind yourself and your team to be disciplined 
"We can skip this step" 
"We already know how we 
want to make this" 
"Let's not worry about that 
for now"

Value-Added Activities 
 An activity that transforms or shapes material or information 
 And the customer wants it 
 And it s done right the first time 
Non Value-Added  Needed Activities 
 Activities causing no value to be created but which cannot be eliminated based on 
current state of technology or thinking 
 Required (regulatory, customer mandate, legal) 
 Necessary (due to non-robustness of process, currently required; current risk 
tolerance) 
Non Value-Added Activities 
 Activities that consume resources but create no value in the eyes of the customer

Specify value: Value is defined by customer in terms of 
specific products &amp; services 
Identify the value stream: Map out all end-to-end linked 
actions, processes and functions necessary for transforming 
inputs to outputs to identify and eliminate waste 
Make value flow continuously: Having eliminated waste, make 
remaining value-creating steps flow
Let customers pull value: Customer pull cascades all the 
way back to the lowest level supplier, enabling ust-in-time 
production 
Pursue perfection: Pursue continuous process of 
improvement striving for perfection</text>

Helps visualize interactions and flows 
Helps identify not only wastes but their sources as well 
Provides a common language for talking about a process 
Makes decision flows apparent 
Forms the basis of an implementation plan 
Shows the linkages between information and material flows 
Identifies the constraint - any resource whose capacity is 
less than customer demand

Lean Thinking: Eliminating Waste 
with the Goal of Creating Value 
 Customer-focused: Customer needs and 
expectations   enterprise activities 
 Knowledge-driven: Draws upon knowledge and
innovation from everyone - workers, suppliers 
 Eliminating waste: Stresses elimination, not just
reduction, of all types of waste 
 Creating value: Puts premium on  , 
not just reducing costs, to benefit all stakeholders 
 Dynamic and continuous: Pursues on-going
systemic as well as incremental improvement - both
innovation and continual improvement

August 15, 1945 -- end of war w th Japan 
Toyota faced a daunting challenge: How to succeed against 
Western mass production auto giants poised to enter Japanese 
market? 
Kiichiro Toyoda to Taiichi Ohno: Catch up with America in three 
years.
Ohno s challenge: How to design a production system exploiting 
central weaknesses of mass production model 
Japan s d emmas 
Small &amp; fragmented market, depleted workforce, scarce natural 
resources, little capital 
Lean evolved as a coherent response to this challenge over a 
number of decades -- a dynamic process of learning and 
adaptation later labeled as lean production by Western observers

Best Japanese auto companies 
developed a fundamentally different 
way of making things 
These companies changed the

2. Prefer One 
Piece Flow 
Where possible 3. Focus on the Product 
and Its Needs Rather 
Than the Organization 
or the Equipment 1. Eliminate 
Activities That 
Are Pure Waste 
4. Focus on actual object and never let it out of sight 
from beginning to completion 
5. Ignore traditional boundaries of jobs, careers, functions, 
and organizations to form a Lean enterprise removing 
all impediments to the continuous ow of the product 
6. Rethink specic work practices and tools to eliminate 
backows, scrap, and all stoppages 3. Flow the Product

Lean applies to engineering
Lean engineering process eliminates waste, 
focuses on value creation, and improves cycle time 
Efficient and standard process enables better 
engineering 
Integrated Product and Process development (IPPD) and other tools are critical for lean enterprise

Lean has demonstrated significant product development-
related performance improvements in 
Engineering processes 
Program outcomes 
Company-level performance 
Multi-stakeholder enterprise and system lifecycle 
Basics of value stream mapping , waste elimination, focus on 
value, and continuous improvement can be applied in a
straightforward way 
PD increases focus on informat ion management and decision-
making processes across mult iple boundaries/stakeholders 
Tools to reduce variation, uncertainty, novelty/exceptions, and 
programmatic disruptions (begin ning at the front end of PD 
through production) enable increased focus on value creationfor customer

Lean Enterprise Principles 
	Create lean value by doing the job right and by 
doing the right job. 
	Deliver value only after identifying stakeholder value and constructing robust value propositions. 
	Fully realize lean value only by adopting an enterprise perspective. 
	Address the interdependencies across enterprise levels to increase lean value. 
	People, not just processes, effectuate lean value.

          <text>Customer Value 
Value measures the worth of a product or 
service to a customer. It is a function of the 
products usefulness to the customer, its 
relative importance to the customers need, 
its availability relative to when it is needed, 
and how much the customer has to pay for 
it.

          <text>Best Life Cycle Value 
A product introduced at the right time and 
for the right price which delivers best 
value in mission effectiveness, 
performance, affordability, and 
sustainability, and comparatively retains 
these advantages over the useful life of 
the product.

          <text>Lean Thinking Embraces the Entire Enterprise Value Stream, 
Focuses on Processes, Cuts Across all Functions &amp; Covers all 
Phases of the Product Lifecycle 
	Enterprise perspective: Lean requires an enterprise 
perspective, encompassing the entire enterprise value stream (extended enterprise), for successful implementation 
	Process focus: Lean views the enterprise as a network of processes; optimizing each process does not optimize the entire set of enterprise processes 
	Functional integration: Lean cuts across &amp; integrates all 
enterprise functions (product development, manufacturing, finance, human resources, customer support) 
	Lifecycle orientation: Lean spans from product development to production to operations &amp; su pport to deliver best lifecycle 
value

          <text>The Role of Short-Term Wins
	Provide evidence that sacrifices are worth it: Wins greatly help justify the 
short-term costs involved. 
	Reward change agents with a pat on the back: After a lot of hard work, 
positive feedback builds morale and motivation 
	Help fine-tune vision and strategies: Short-term wins give the guiding 
coalition concrete data on the viability of their ideas. 
	Undermine cynics and se lf-serving resisters: Clear improvements in 
performance make it difficult for people to block needed change. 
	Keep bosses on board: Provides those higher in the hierarchy with 
evidence that transformation is on track. 
	Build momentum: Turns neutrals into supporters,  reluctant supporters into 
active helpers, etc.

Messiness of the process
	Vision creation is usually a proce ss of two steps forward and one back, 
movement to the left and then to the right. 
Time frame
	Vision is never created in a single m eeting.  The activity takes months, 
sometimes years. 
End product
	The process results in a direction for th e future that is desirable, feasible, 
focused, flexible, and is conveyable in five minutes or less.

	Create a crisis by allowing a financial loss, exposing managers to 
major weaknesses vis--vis competitors,  or allowing error to blow up 
instead of being corrected at the last minute 
	Eliminate obvious examples of  excess (e.g., company-owned 
country club facilities, a large air force, gourmet executive dining 
rooms 
	Set revenue, income, productivity, cu stomer satisfaction, and cycle-
time targets so high that they  cant be reached by conducting 
business as usual 
	Stop measuring subunit perform ance based only on narrow 
functional goals. Insist that more people be held accountable for 
broader measures of business performance.

          <text>Creating an Effective Vision
First Draft
	The process often starts with an initial statement from a single 
individual, reflecting both his or he r dreams and real marketplace needs. 
Role of the guiding coalition
	The first draft is always modeled over time by the guiding coalition or an 
even larger group of people. 
Importance of teamwork
	The group process never works well without a minimum of effective 
teamwork. 
Role of the head and the heart
	Both analytical thinking and a lot of  dreaming are essential throughout 
the activity.

Architecting As An Art And
Science Applicable To Enterprises 
	Complexity of 21st century systems is  driving systems architecting as 
an important activity within systems engineering to the extent that it is 
sometimes now considered to be independent of systems engineering   
	Similarly, complexity of 21st centur y enterprises is driving the need for 
enterprise systems architecting as a unique activity that is distinct from 
enterprise engineering

          <text>Enterprise Systems Architecting 
As An Emerging Art And Science 
To differentiate our approach from the cu rrent enterprise architecting theory 
and practice, we use the term Enterprise Systems Architecting 
	Architecting looks not just at transition from an as is to the to be 
state, but also at the underlying decision analysis related to various 
alternative could be states 
	Architecting enriches the thinki ng about the enterprise through a 
deeper exploration of each enterprise view, and at the
interconnections and interrelationships between these views 
	Decisions are made about the alternatives in context of the business 
model, technology strategy, culture, purpose, and other factors 
	Architecting is both art and science , and the current state of systems
architecting is probably more of the former 
	The art uses qualitative and heuristic techniques including lessons 
learned, value judgments, and soft measures 
	Increasingly, architecting is a science using quantitative analytic
techniques - math, modeling, measurement

          <text>Transitioning from Enterprise Architecting
to Enterprise Systems Architecting 
Enterprises have long been studied by management scientists
and social scientists  largely through taking one single view
(organizational or IT) 
	In early work in this field, Rechti n (2000) proposes the principles of 
systems architecting as extensib le to architecting organizations.  
	Additional works (e.g., Bernus, 2003)  describe information enterprise 
architecting with some extens ion to organizational factors 
	Others describe a process-based view 
Enterprise Architecting practice is well established today but
tends to be information technology centric 
	Works well for the simpler enterpri ses trying to align processes and 
technology with organizational structure. 
	As enterprises move from simple organizations to a complex networked 
organizations (extended enterprise),  an enriched view is needed 
	Needs to be more highly integrated with strategy and culture, and we 
require some new lens with which to view the enterprise

          <text>Enterprise Systems Architecting 
	With the growing complexity of systems, there is a corresponding
increase in the complexity of the enterprises that develop, operate,
and sustain such systems in an increasingly global environment 
	Enterprises are complex, highly integrated systems comprised of
processes, organizations, information and technologies, with
multifaceted interdependencies and interrelationships 
	There are many aspects of an enterprise that must be considered:
political, cultural, legal, economic, environmental, technological, 
sociological, psychological, geographical, and temporal
	Current practice of Enterprise Architecting has been a significant 
contribution to creating and sustaining modern enterprises; however,
we feel the current field is not a sufficient approach to the enterprises
of this new century 
	Enterprise Systems Architecting is  a new strategic approach which 
takes a systems perspective, viewing the entire enterprise as a
holistic system encompassing multiple views such as organization
view, process view, knowledge view, and enabling technology viewin an integrated framework

	Applying architecting to enterprises is not a new idea  
we have seen it evolve over the past decade 
	Enterprise Architecting has grown into a well-recognized

	One of the shortfalls of the current field of enterprise 
architecting is that it currently takes an information

          <text>Summary 
 Enterprises, much like products, must be architected as 
complex integrated systems
 In the past decade, weve seen the evolution of enterprise
architecting which has led to development of architecture
frameworks, standards, modeling languages and tools
 We see the current field as too limited, and that a more holistic 
systems approach to architecting enterprises is needed 
 Complex enterprises exhibit systems properties, as well as
unique emergent qualities/values rooted in the human 
dimension 
 There is significant research ongoing at MIT and other leading
universities to evolve this art and science, and more is needed
to address challenging research questions 
 Further work is beginning on how to educate the future 
systems leaders who will architect, build, and transform
complex enterprise systems

          <text>Enterprise Systems Architecting
As An Emerging Art And Science 
	Enterprises of this century are truly systems in themselves 
and as such the properties for complex systems also relate
to complex enterprises 
	System properties : sustainability, scalability, flex ibility, agility, stability, 
adaptability, robu stness, and others 
	Soft properties (emergent values) : extend from the human dimension 
inherent in the enterprise system 
	We are beginning to research how the various properties
and behaviors of systems relate to enterprises 
	What enterprise architecture could maximize the long term stability of the 
enterprise? 
	What architecture would maximize the fl exibility of the enterprise in regard 
to its ability to design i nnovative new products?  
	Can a single enterprise model be optim ized for both such properties, or do 
we need to select fo r one over another? 
	A far-reaching goal would be to develo p the knowledge that is needed to be 
able to model enterprises in such as way that we can predict enterprise 
behaviors and outcomes to optimize ar ound various properties, and provide 
the flexibility that will enable ease of change to the enterprise system in the 
future.

	How do you organize to deliver best value to the full set of 
enterprise stakeholders in context of a given business
model? 
	What measures and incentives are most effective in context 
of enterprise structural and behavioral factors? 
	Are enterprises are more effective if processes are
standardized and managed at the enterprise level rather 
than localized level? 
	How can knowledge be integrated across an extended
enterprise that crosses individual single enterprise (e.g.,
company) boundaries? 
	How do you architect an enterprise that can most effectively
produce a desired product system ?

          <text>Manage the Architecture when Key Enterprise 
Stakeholders are outside Hierarchical Influence 
	Key stakeholders (product line managers, risk-sharing 
partners, etc.) fall outside the domain of control of
enterprise leaders 
	Limited control over organizational dynamics 
compensated by emphasis on control over productarchitecture 
	E.g.: Toyota product centers
	Focus is to re-use knowledge, verified designs, existing 
infrastructure, and enterprise relationships 
	Tradeoff is efficiency (enabled through reuse) with 
performance (in meeting a specific customers demands)

Approaches to Enterprise Integration 
	Senior management buy-in to phase gate or PLE 
process essential 
	Continuous review of how projects line up against 
enterprise strategy 
	Discipline required to ensure new products fit 
within strategic plan 
	Formal product development processes defined
	Formal portfolio management processes in place
	High performance using directive control involves 
deliberate organizational and product design

 Do the enterprise processes deliver the 
stakeholder values for the enterprise?
	How well do the enterprise processes 
deliver value to the stakeholders? 
 Which processes deliver the most 
value? which deliver the least?

	Start in the upper left quadrant and move around
the matrix in a counter-clockwise direction 
	The following questions will help fill in the matrix with either, strong, weak, or no interaction. 
1.	Is this strategic objective measured by this
metric? 
2.	Does this metric measure performance of this
process? 
3.	Does this process contribute to delivering this
stakeholder value? 
4.	Is this stakeholder value represented by this
strategic objective?

          <text>Level Three: Horizontal Alignment 
Two phases: 
1. 	The global optimization of  work flow across all process 
boundaries. These boundaries become transparent to the flow 
of work. Metrics are customer-focused and assess the 
enterprise-level capability of a pr ocess to provide value from the 
customers perspective. 
2. 	The global optimization of wo rk flow across all organizational 
boundaries that support or use a particular process. Metrics are 
customer-focused and assess how well the infrastructure enables execution of customer-focused processes.

          <text>Case Study: Air Force Sustainment 
Initial Field-Study Observations
	Current metrics generally foster local optimization rather
than global optimization 
	Depot maintenance metrics are prim arily focused on financial and 
related measures of performance 
	Metrics conflict with deliver y of best customer support 
	Current metrics generally do not allow measures ofprogress towards the achievement of system-wide goals 
	Impossible to trace incremental impact on the warfighter of 
improvement actions at local leve l (e.g., incremental investment in 
more parts and materials) 
	Informed tradeoff decisions ca nnot be made at system-level 
	Current metrics drive the wrong behavior 
	Big example is cannibalization (rem oval of a serviceable component 
from one end-item waiting fo r parts to repair another)

	Many metrics sub-optimized by local organizational 
interests rather than having them aligned with 
customer interests and with the strategic

action to change outcomes

	From a process perspective, th e enterprise will have much 
greater influence on the market than  its size might indicate.  The 
agile and forward-looking enterp rise will be able to foresee 
events and respond to those events before they occur. 
	From a metrics perspective, the enterprise will be able not only 
to simulate and predict the outcome of a strategy before its 
deployment, but also to predict th e effect of specific metrics on 
the outcome of that strategy before choosing metrics.

          <text>Characteristics of good metrics 
	Metrics are meaningful, quantified measures
	Metric must present data or information that allows 
us to take action 
	Helps to identify what should be done 
	Helps to identify who should do it 
	Metrics should be tied to strategy and to core processes - indicate how well organizational 
objectives and goals are being met 
	Metrics should foster process understanding and 
motivate individual, group, or team action and 
continual improvement.

          <text>Case Study: Nike 
	The study focuses on European Operations of Nike. 
	The company is organized around  three lines of business: 
Apparel  60,000 SKU, Footwear  25000 SKU, and  Equipment 
1000 SKU. 
	90% of the business comes fr om 6 countries in Europe. 
	The product life cycles are short. 
	Uncertainty of demand is an important characteristic. 
	Company was continuously improving its supply chain 
management through a better integration of operations across 
subsequent echelons and separate functions in the value
chain. 
	As part of these efforts manage ment decided to assign some 
of their resources for improvement projects to performance
management. The integration of various local performance
indicators into a company-wide consistent system was
required.

The project objectives:
	To develop a set of high-level performance metrics
tailored to the specific business needs for use by the
senior supply chain management  team, i.e. Operations, 
while including existing local metrics as much as possible
and sensible. 
	To design a format, i.e. a scorecard, displaying the metric 
scores at the level of Nike as well as that of the business 
units.

Definition
Vertical alignment i li i ic s the a gnment and re nforcement of strateg

	The business enterprise applies a process focus so it can 
measure leading indicators of the expected process output 
	Defective process output is viewed as a process-capability 
problem, not a people problem

          <text>What is performance 
measurement? 
	Performance measurement is the process of measuring 
efficiency, effectiveness and capability, of an action or a process or a system, against given norm or target. 
	Effectiveness is a measure of doi ng the right job - the extent to 
which stakeholder requirements are met. 
	Efficiency is a measure of doing the job right - how economically the resources are utilized when providing a given level of stakeholder satisfaction. 
	Capability is a measure of ab ility required to do both the job 
right and right job, in the short term as well as the long term. This can be tangible, such as, resources, technology, or 
intangible, such as a corporate culture.

Level Four: Total Alignment 
Definition
Total alignment is the synergistic interaction of metrics from all 
support processes with metrics from all core process to reinforce 
the strategy and to drive business excellence. 
	All employees clearly see where the business is headed 
and how they can make a difference. 
	Horizontal integration (Level 3) provides employees with line of sight to customer value.  Dramatic performance improvements can occur at this level. 
	Total enterprise-level alignmen t (Level 4) is required to 
overcome the major systemic barriers to great performance and to embed the long-term gains into the fabric of the 
organizations culture.

          <text>although there may be a potenti ally long list of non-financial 
indicators, individual firms have to be selective by linking 
explicitly their choice of indicator s to their corporate strategy.
No One Right Set of Metrics 
	The balanced scorecard has to be tailored to 
each specific company 
	The resulting scorecard of indicators should be driven by the firms strategy if it is not to consist merely of a listing of indicators: 
indicators, individual firms have to be selective by linking although there may be a potenti ally long list of non-financial

          <text>Case Study: Nike 
Developing and Embedding Performance Measurement System 
	Defined a metrics dictionary with some 100 fixed metrics combined with an 
overview of existing initiatives, while  being much more flexible regarding 
the structure. 
	Used a hierarchical structure within ea ch cluster, thereby using so-called 
engineered indicators i .e. metrics based on two or more lower-level 
metrics. 
	Brought together all people working on para llel initiatives in the field of PM 
within the organization. 
	Experimented with different ways of cl ustering the metrics and presenting 
the scorecards. 
	Gathered the data required for actua lly measuring and reporting all metrics 
in a reliable way. 
	One person of the cross-functi onal initiatives group managed the 
performance reporting process.
	The PM manager has authority to make changes in the definition, to make 
sure that metrics remain consiste nt between various areas and with the 
global scorecard. Lohman, C., et al. (2004) Designing a performance measurement system: A case 
study. European Journal of Operational Research , v.156, pp.267-286.

Metrics Thermostat research reveals a far more complex metrics structure 
than indicated by top-down hierarchic al metrics structure currently being 
used 
	AFMC Metrics Handbook: Presents hierarch ical metrics structure (command; 
mission element board (M EB); center-process metrics) 
	US Air Force Logistics Transformation Team Balanced Scorecard approach 
Complex feedback loops show system behavioral dynamics not otherwise well 
understood 
	Increased fix rates lead to higher aircraft utilization, higher FMC rates, and increased 
flying effectiveness 
	But this also results in increased break rat es, leading to lower fix rates by tapping 
limited resources, and there fore lowering FMC rates 
	Model quantifies net effects of complex interactions 
Model provides new insights into the pr evalence and effects of cannibalization 
not available before 
	Quantitative evidence provides new shows th at cannibalization at field level has net 
negative effect on the overa ll F-16 mission capability rate 
	Shows how cannibalization (an emergent system property) is driving wrong 
behavior

LESAT Section I:  Example
Level 1I.B.3 Lean Enterprise Vision - new mental model of the enterprise
Senior leaders have varying visi ons of lean, from none to 
well-defined
Level 2
Level 3
Level 4
Level 5Senior leaders adopt common vision of lean
Lean vision has been communicated and is understood 
by most employees
Common vision of lean is shared by the extended 
enterprise
Stakeholders have internalized the lean vision &amp; are an 
active part of achieving it

Enterprise Assessment Insights
LESAT is catalyst to elevate  lean to enterprise level
Differences in perception were disclosed between management 
layers
VPs: Were highly committed!
Directors: Doesnt look like it to us!
Opportunities for strategic l ean actions surface from gap 
analysis
The discussion resulting from the assessment analysis proved 
more valuable than the exact scores
Many organizations plateau without total enterprise view
A more holistic understanding of the role of leadership, core, 
and enabling processes in delivering value ensued
LESAT is complementary to existing assessment tools</text>

SECTION I:  LEAN TRANSFORMATION/LEADERSHIP 
Definition:  Develop, deploy, and manage lean implementation plans throughout the 
enterprise, leading to: (1)- long-term sustainability, (2)- acquiring competitive advantage, and (3)- satisfaction of stakeholders; along with a continuous improvement in all three parameters. 
 
I.A Enterprise Strategic Planning - the decision to pursue a lean transformation is strategic in nature.  Its impact throughout the 
enterprise is profound and pervasive, affecting all business practices and processes.  The lean enterprise will behave in a fun damentally 
new manner, significantly eliminating waste and enhancing relationships with all stakeholders. 
Diagnostic Questions  Are enterprise leaders aware of the strategic opportunities (i.e., greater growth, profitability, and market 
penetration) associated with transitioning to a lean enterprise? 
 Are enterprise leaders familiar with the dramatic increases in competitiveness that many companies have 
realized as a result of transitioning to lean? 
 Has a suitable strategy for growth been identified to utilize resources freed up by improvements?  
Lean Indicators  Lean implementation is included explicitly in the enterprise strategic plan. 
 Results of lean implementation impact future strategic planning. 
 Strategic planning is strongly influenced by stakeholders and customers value.  
LP Lean  Capability Levels 
# Practices Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 
A.1 Integration of 
Lean in Strategic 
Planning Process 
 
Lean impacts growth, 
profitability and market 
penetration Concepts and benefits 
of lean principles and 
practices are not 
evident in culture or 
business plans Lean is recognized but 
relegated to lower 
levels &amp; is fragmented The business growth 
implications of lean are 
understood and lean 
implementation plans 
are formulated, but not 
integrated into the 
strategic plan  Transitioning to lean 
adopted as a key 
enterprise strategy and 
is included in strategic 
plan Strategic plans leverag e
the results of lean 
implementation to 
achieve growth, 
profitability &amp; market 
position 
A.2 Focus on 
Customer Value 
 
Customers pull value 
from enterprise value 
stream Means of defining 
value to customer(s) is 
informal &amp; 
unstructured  Structured process for 
defining value is 
applied to selected 
customers  How the enterprise can 
best contribute to 
customer's success is 
well defined Customer value 
strongly influences the 
strategic direction  Competitiveness is 
enhanced as customer 
value becomes 
predominant driving 
force throughout the 
extended enterprise 
A.3 Leveraging the 
Extended 
Enterprise   
Value stream extends 
from customer through 
the enterprise to 
suppliers Relations with 
customers and suppliers 
reflect a "We-They" 
mentality Initial opportunities 
identified for 
establishing extended 
enterprise linkages Strategic planning 
process explicitly 
includes consideration 
of key stakeholders in 
value streams  Integration &amp; balancing 
of stakeholder values 
via collaborative 
supplier relations &amp; 
strategic  pa rtnering Integration of the 
extended enterprise 
contributes to 
innovation, growth, 
increased profitability

Ground Rules
Perform the assessment from a total enterprise 
perspective, NOT individual functional area
Attempt to assess every practice; leave blank if N/A or 
if you dont know
Scoring the practices
Each level assumes that lo wer level criteria are met
If between levels, score at the lower level
Note evidence for level selected
Identify opportunities to increase maturity level
Seek assistance from company facilitator</text>

Lean Enterprise Practices
There are 54 lean enterprise practices in the 
assessment, divided amongst the three major sections
Section 1 Leadership/Transformation (28 practices)
Section 2 Lifecycle Processes (18 Practices)
Section 3 Enabling Infrastructure (8 Practices)
Each practice is assessed on a capability maturity 
scale of 1 to 5
There is a practice maturity definition for every 
maturity level in every practice, provided on a maturity 
matrix assessment sheet</text>

Rather than route the materials required through the entire plant, materials flow 
to the head of each work cell, through each process in the cell, then to final 
assembly. This eliminates most of the transportation and waiting we would see 
in the traditional approach.

A holistic manufacturing system design framework 
to ensure process considerations are integra
to the product development process 
Characteristics 
	Uses principles of systems engineering 
	Visual depiction of design beyond factory floor ideas 
	Manufacturing as part of the product strategy 
	Manufacturing system design is strategy driven, not product
design driven 
	Combines multiple useful tools 
	Provides insights into order and interactions

Organizational theory examines how organizations 
function and their relationships with their environment
Organizational Structure
The formal system of task 
and authority relationships that control how people are to cooperate and use resources to achieve the organization's goals.Organizational Design
The process by which 
managers select and manage various dimensions and components of organizational structure and culture so that an organization can control the activities necessary to achieve its goals.Organizational Culture
The set of shared values 
and norms that control organizational membersinteractions with each other and with people outside the organization.
Organizational Theory
The study of how organizations function and how they affect and
are affected by the environm ent in which they operate.

Lean cultural assumptions:
Four Rules at Toyota
1. All work shall be highly specified as to content, 
sequence, timing and outcome
2. Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and 
there must be an unambiguous yes-or-no way to send 
requests and receive responses
3. The pathway for every product and service must be 
simple and direct
4. Any improvement must be made in accordance with the 
scientific method, under the guidance of a teacher, at the lowest level in the organization.

Premise 4: Successful change requires three 
forms of leadership.
Executive leaders - defining the organizational 
environment, offering permission, protection, 
evaluation, and context. 
Local line leaders - developing changes in 
ways that produce results, galvanizing activity 
around a project, and managing accountability. 
Internal networkers - building community and 
diffusing experience, making sure that the line 
leaders do not act alone.</text>

Who makes change? 
A line leader of a pilot group, galvanizing 
activity around a project (Project manager? 
Regional manager? Local leader?)
An executive leader, offering permission, 
protection, evaluation, and context (CEO? 
Senior executive? Board member?)
One or more internal networkers, making 
sure that the line leaders do not act alone. (HR 
or IT staff? Well-placed frequent flier?)</text>

The Bottom Line Questions
1. Does culture have to change or do you have to 
change business processes within the present culture?
2. If culture has to change, can you build on enhancing 
cultural strengths rather than eliminating elements of culture?
3. If cultural elements have to be eliminated, are you 
prepared to deal with the anxieties involved?
4. Are you willing to allo cate the time and resources 
necessary to actually change the culture?

Profound Change
 is change that combines inner
shifts in peoples values, aspirations 
and behaviors with outer shifts in 
processes, strategies, practices and systems The organization doesnt 
just do something new; it builds its 
capacity for doing things in a new 
way  indeed, it builds capacity for 
ongoing change.

Profound Change
Leaders instigating change are often 
like gardeners standing over their 
plants, imploring them: Grow! Try 
harder! You can do it! [But] if the seed does not have the potential to 
grow, theres nothing anyone can do 
to make a difference.

Lean &amp; Organizational Theory
Historically, lean in American manufacturing has 
focused on this conversion process:
Effective ways that organizations take their inputs and 
convert them to outputs that create the most value for 
customers
focus on value, 
improve value stream, 
organize to flow, 
respond to downstream pull, and 
pursue perfection
Enterprise Lean goes beyond the conversion process 
itself and examines the relationships and dependencies 
of that conversion process with the enterprises 
environment, inputs and outputs</text>

Cultural Change Issues
1. Identify the business problem or issue
2. Develop strategy &amp; tactics to deal with issue/solve problem
3. Assess the present state of the culture to identify how 
assumptions will aid or hinder what is to be done
4. Focus on those cultural elements that will aid you, ignore the 
ones that will hinder you unless they are absolute constraints
5. Identify the people in your organization who are culture 
carriers of the elements that will aid you
6. Empower these culture carriers &amp; build change teams around 
them
7. Develop processes for overcoming normal resistance to 
change

What accounts for differences in the 
performance of Mass and Lean Enterprises?
To understand some of the difference in performance 
we will go to organizational theory:
Organizations, and enterprises, can be thought of as  
tools used to achieve goals
They create value through a cyclic process, involving 
their:
 inputs
 conversion process
 outputs
 environment

	Three attributes: 
	POWER to influence the enterprise, 
	LEGITIMACY of the relationship or the stake, 
	CRITICALITY of the claim on the enterprise 
	POWER can be coercive, utilitarian, or symbolic
	LEGITIMACY is the perception that the actions of an
entity are desirable, or appropriate within some
socially constructed system of norms, values,
beliefs, and definitions 
	CRITICALITY is present when the claim is of time-sensitive nature and/or when the claim is important
or critical to the stakeholder

          <text>Alpha Contracting Event II
 Objective: Reduce time from RFP to formal proposal 
 Faster contract time brings capability to warfighter quicker 
 Initial Alpha Contracting event held in Feb 2003 
	Reduced contracting time from 351 M-days to 252 M-days (initial 28% 
reduction) 
 Alpha Contracting Event II held 3-6 May 2004 
	Objective of further reducing cont racting time to support spiral 
acquisition 
	Involved SPO, NG, Raytheon, L-3 Comm, Vought, DCMA, DCAA 
 Findings 
	Three types of contracts identi fied (Development, Production, 
Engineering/Contract Changes) 
	Each contract type should requires different approaches 
	Earlier subcontractor involvemen t reduces rework and reduces time 
	Better method of developing requi rements and estimates between 
SPO and NG defined

 Robins had been doing Lean for six years
 Reaped low hanging fruit 
 Expanded Lean across depot maintenance 
 Achieved some significant breakthroughs (e.g., C-5 PDM) 
 But 
 Lean perceived as good for only industrial processes 
 Events were more ad hoc than integrated 
 Tactical versus strategic approach 
 Every Center doing their own thing 
Needed an Enterprise Strategy for Lean

          <text>Theory: Lean Represents a Hybrid
Approach to Organizing Interfirm
Relationships
	Markets (Arm s Length): Lower production costs, higher coordination costs 
	Firm buys (all) inputs from  outside specialized suppliers 
	Inputs are highly standardized ; no transaction-specific assets 
	Prices serve as sole coordination mechanism 
	Hierarchies (Vertical Integration): Higher production costs, lower 
coordination costs 
	Firm produces required inputs in- house (in the extreme, all inputs) 
	Inputs are highly customized, involve high transaction costs or dedi cated investments, and 
require close coordination 
	Lean (Hybrid): Lowest production and coordi nation costs; economically 
most efficient choice-- new model 
	Firm buys both customized &amp; standardized inputs 
	Customized inputs often involve dedicated investments 
	Partnerships &amp; strategic alliance s provide collaborative advantage

          <text>Quick Review of Aerospace Progress
	Aerospace industry has made important strides in supplier integration, 
but this is only the beginning of the road 
	Production: Supplier certification an d long-term supplier partnerships -
process control &amp; pa rts synchronization 
	Development: Early supplier integrat ion into product development cr itical 
	Strategic supply chain design is a meta core competency 
	Implementation efforts have required new approaches 
	Re-examination of basic assumptions (e.g., make-buy) 
	New roles and responsibilities between primes and suppliers 
	Communication and trust fund amental to implementation 
	Aerospace community faces new challenges and opportunities 
	Imperative to take value st ream view of supplier networks 
	Focus on delivering best li fecycle value to customer 
	Need to evolve information-tec hnology-mediated new organizationa l 
structures for managing extended enterprises in a globalized market 
environment

          <text>Electronic Integration of Supplier 
Networks: Early Results
Challenge: Electronic integration of supplier networks for technical 
data exchange as well as for sync hronization of business processes 
	Important success factors include: 
	Clear business vision &amp; strategy 
	Early stakeholder participation (e.g., top management support; interna l 
process owners; suppliers ; joint configuration control) 
	Migration/integration of specific function ality benefits of legacy systems into 
evolving new IT/IS infrastructure 
	Great care and thought in  scaling-up ex perimental IT/IS projects into fully-
functional operational systems  
	Electronic integration of suppliers  requires a process of positive 
reinforcement -- greater mutual information exchange helps build 
increased trust, which in turn enable s a closer collaborative relationship 
and longer-term  strategic partnership 
	Close communication links with ov erseas suppliers pose a serious
security risk and complex policy challenge

          <text>Critiquing Knowledge Management 
Technologists never evangelize wi thout a disclaimer: "Technology 
is just an enabler." True enough -- and the disclaimer discloses part 
of the problem: Enabling what? One flaw in knowledge
management is that it often neglec ts to ask what knowledge to 
manage and toward what end. Kn owledge management activities 
are all over the map: Building databases, measuring intellectual capital, establishing corporate libraries, building intranets, sharing best practices, installing groupware, leading training programs,leading cultural change, fostering collaboration, creating virtualorganizations -- all of these ar e knowledge management, and every 
functional and staff leader can lay claim to it. But no one claims the 
big question: Why?

K = (c/r)((1+r)n -1 )
Where:
K = Value of knowledge 
c = standard cost of acquiring knowledge in each time period 
r = a long-run rate of return on investment 
n = number of years of education 
For a formal education, using c = $9,230, r = 5.34%, n = 12, K = $149,840

          <text>Case Study Lessons Learned
 One size does not fit all: 
	The two cases used contrasting IT implementation approaches. 
Their strategies were a functi on of resource availability, 
management commitment and system understanding. The 
approach adopted must reflec t limitations imposed by the 
organization, technology and culture. 
 Authority to transform the enterprise: 
	The team given responsibility for designing and implementing 
the system must be given authorit y and the requisite budget to 
drive change. 
 Gaining user commitment: 
	Not communicating the criticality of transitioning to the new 
system is a common stumbling block in gaining user
commitment. This requires user involvement in the process 
redesign as well as training of end users in the process 
changes and in using the tool itself. 
 Managing process evolution: 
	A successful execution requir es management of process 
changes before, during and af ter system implementation.

Aerospace alone is an estimated $10.4
Billion market for 2005 
 Daratech Report 
The aerospace companies want to shed IT

 David Hughes, AWST, 2003 
PLM is an emerging technology with a

There is no point in doing a value stream map and finding out 
where improvements can be made, if you do not have the
authority and the funding to actually make changes 
~Senior Manager of Engineering~ 
Everyone is into reducing waste and continuous improvement so
[Lean] becomes the change agent  the common language we 
all speak to justify going to our (common) singular system.

          <text>The Pooh Analogy
Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs 
now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his 
head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far 
as he knows, the only way of coming 
downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there 
really is another way, if only he could stop 
bumping for a moment and think of it. -
