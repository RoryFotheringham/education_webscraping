Statistical Approach
Randomly select a configuration and calculate cost, Cr
If Cr&lt; Cr-1 accept rthconfiguration
If Cr&gt; Cr-1            accept r only if exp(-Cr/T) &gt; Random(0,1)
when Cris accepted, decrease T (system temperature)
Continue until system is frozen (no new solution accepted in N trials)
Does not guarantee global minimum
Quick and easy implementation
Reasonable solution achieved in short computation time

/G129Main problem computationally is 
the existence of a singularity
/G129Problem can be avoided by an 
application ofEuler stheorem:
The Orientation of a body is uniquely
specified by a vector giving the direction 
of a body axis and a scalar specifying a 
rotation angle about the axis. EULEREULERS THEOREMS THEOREM
/G129Definition introduces a redundant 
fourth element , which eliminates 
the singularity.
/G129This is the quaternion concept

/G129One creates torques on a spacecraft by creating equal but opposite 
torques on Reaction Wheels (flywheels on motors).
For three-axes of torque, three wheels are necessary.  Usually use four 
wheels for redundancy (use wheel speed biasing equation)
If external torques exist, wheels will angularly accelerate to counteract 
these torques.  They will eventually reach an RPM limit (~3000-6000 
RPM) at which time they must be desaturated.
Static &amp; dynamic imbalances can induce vibrations (mount on isolators)
Usually operate around some nominal spin rate to avoidstiction effects.
Needs to be carefully balanced !

/G129Gravity Gradient: TidalForce due to 1/r2 gravitational field variation 
for long, extended bodies (e.g. Space Shuttle, Tethered vehicles)
/G129Aerodynamic Drag: Weathervane Effect due to an offset between the 
CM and the drag center of Pressure (CP). Only a factor in LEO.
/G129Magnetic Torques: Induced by residual magnetic moment. Model the 
spacecraft as a magnetic dipole. Only within magnetosphere.
/G129Solar Radiation: Torques induced by CM and solar CP offset. Can 
compensate with differential reflectivity or reaction wheels.
/G129Mass Expulsion: Torques induced by leaks or jettisoned objects
/G129Internal:On-board Equipment (machinery, wheels, cryocoolers, pumps 
etc). No net effect, but internal momentum exchange affects attitude.Typical Disturbances</text>

required for momentum dumping 
/G129Relatively high power, weight, cost

(can get complicated with redundancy)Active Control Systems directly sense spacecraft attitude
and supply a torque command to alter it as required. This
is the basic concept of feedback control.

/G129Rate Gyros (Gyroscopes)
Measure the angular rate of a 
spacecraft relative to inertial space
Need at least three.  Usually use 
more for redundancy.
Can integrate to get angle.  
However,
DC bias errors in electronics will cause the output of the 
integrator to ramp and 
eventually saturate (drift)
Thus, need inertial update /G129Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
Integrated unit with sensors, 
mounting hardware,electronics and 
software
measure rotation of spacecraft with rate gyros
measure translation of spacecraft 
with accelerometers
often mounted on gimbaled 
platform (fixed in inertial space)
Performance 1: gyro drift rate (range: 0 .003 deg/hr to 1 deg/hr)
Performance 2: linearity (range: 1 
to 5E-06 g/g^2 over range 20-60 g
Typically frequently updated with 
external measurement (Star Trackers, Sun sensors) via a

Ordinary white light is made up of waves that fluctuate 
at all possible angles. Light is considered to be 
"linearly polarized" when it contains waves that only 
fluctuate in one specific plan (Polarizers are shown)

 Sensitivity :
Rather than the total amount of signal in an image (which depends on gain in the 
camera's electronics), sensitivity is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) obtained with a given exposure time. The S/N is a measure of quality; the higher the ratio, the less gritty an image will appear 
 A very good deep sky object at least 25 S/N.  Smaller pixel(9m)=&gt;longer exposure time (lower sensitivity)
a faint deepsky object may be oversampled
 Larger pixel(24m)=&gt; greater sensitivity, undersampled for bright source.

          <text>Static Optical Aberrations (II)
Chromatic Aberration -- usually associated with objective lenses of refractor telescopes. It is the failure of a 
lens to bring light of different wavelengths (colors) to a common focus. This results mainly in a faint colored 
halo (usually violet) around bright stars, the planets and the moon. It also reduces lunar and planetary contrast. It usually shows up more as speed and aperture increase. Achromat doublets in refractors help 
reduce this aberration and more expensive, sophisticated designs like apochromats and those using fluorite 
lenses can virtually eliminate it. 
Spherical Aberration -- causes light rays passing through a lens (or reflected from a mirror) at different 
distances from the optical center to come to focus at different points on the axis. This causes a star to be seen 
as a blurred disk rather than a sharp point. Most telescopes are designed to eliminate this aberration. 
Coma -- associated mainly with parabolic reflector telescopes which affect the off-axis images and are more 
pronounced near the edges of the field of view. The images seen produce a V-shaped appearance. The faster 
the focal ratio, the more coma that will be seen near the edge although the center of the field (approximately a circle, which in mm is the square of the focal ratio) will still be coma-free in well-designed and manufactured instruments. 
Astigmatism -- a lens aberration that elongates images which change from a horizontal to a vertical position 
on opposite sides of best focus. It is generally associated with poorly made optics or collimation errors. 
Field Curvature -- caused by the light rays not all coming to a sharp focus in the same plane. The center of 
the field may be sharp and in focus but the edges are out of focus and vice versa.

          <text>Optimizing a CCD Imaging System (II) 
Anti-blooming :helps protect against the objectionable streaks that occur 
when bright objects saturate the CCD, causing an excess charge to bleed down 
a column of pixels. This feature can, however, produce side effects like 
increased dark current and reduced sensitivity. 
Quantum Efficiency (QE):
Q.E. of a sensor describes its response 
to different wavelengths of light (see 
chart). Standard front-illuminated sensors, for example, are more sensitive to green, red, and infrared wavelengths (in the 500 to 800 nm range) than they are to blue wavelengths (400 - 500 nm). Note
Back-illuminated CCDs have 
exceptional quantum efficiency compared to front-illuminated CCDs.

MAKSUTOV -uses a thick meniscus correcting lens with a 
strong curvature and a secondary mirror that is usually an 
aluminized spot on the corrector. The secondary mirror is 
typically smaller than the Schmidt's giving it slightly better 
resolution for planetary observing. Heavier than the Schmidt 
and because of the thick correcting lens takes a long time to reach thermal stability at night in larger apertures (over 90mm). 
Typically is easier to make but requires more material for the 
corrector lens than the Schmidt-Cassegrain. Schmidt-Cassegrain the light enters through a thin 
aspheric Schmidt correcting lens, then strikes the spherical primary mirror and is reflected back up the tube 
and intercepted by a small secondary mirror which 
reflects the light out an opening in the rear of the 
instrument. Compact(F# f/10-f/15), Correcting Lens 
eliminates Spherical aberration,coma, Astigmatism, 
Image Field Curvature at the expense of central 
obstruction,chromatic error(from refractive lense)

Optimal Cluster Re-sizingObjective of Techsat 21 Geo-
location mission is to provide 
10-50 m geo-location accuracy
Geo-location accuracy is 
inversely proportional to size 
of cluster
Re-size cluster to an elliptical 
trajectory of 2.5 km to achieve 
approximately 10 m ground 
resolution
Example application is to 
quickly locate a lost pilot

Earths Magnetic FieldEarths Magnetic Field
 Many formation flight missions will operate in LEO.  
 The electromagnets will interact 
with the Earths magnetic field producing unwanted forces and torques on the formation
 The Earths magnetic field can be 
approximated by a large bar magnet with a magnetic dipole strength of 8*10

DipoleDipole --Dipole InteractionDipole Interaction
 Just as an idealized electric charge in an external electric field can be assigned 
a scalar potential, so can an idealized magnetic dipole in a static external 
magnetic field, by taking the inner product of the two
 Continuing the analogy, the force on the dipole is simply found by taking the 
negative potential gradient with respect to position coordinates
 In a similar manner, taking the gradient wit h respect to angle will give the torque 
experienced by the dipole
 Since the Force results from taking a gradient with respect to position, and the 
Torque does not, the scaling laws for the two are given as2 UB=GG

Question II:Question II:
 Are there missions where the absolute position of the center of mass of 
a cluster of spacecraft does not require control?
 Yes!  In fact most of the ones we can think of
 Image construction
 u-v filling does not depend on absolute position
 Earth coverage
 As with single spacecraft, Gravity moves the mass center of the 
cluster as a whole, except for perturbations
 Disturbance (perturbation) rejection
 The effort to control perturbations affecting absolute cluster 
motion (such as J2) is much greater than that for relative motion
 Only disturbances affecting the relative positions (such as 
differential J2) NEED controlling to keep a cluster together
 Docking
 Docking is clearly a relative position enabled maneuver</text>

How Far Apart Will They Work?How Far Apart Will They Work?
 Writing the force in terms of the coil radius ( R), separation distance ( s) and 
total loop current (IT), the force scales as
 We see that for a given coil curren t, the system scales photographically, 
meaning that two systems with the same loop current that are simply scaled versions of one another will have the same force
 For design, it is of interest to re-write in terms of coil mass and radius, and 
physical constants:
 The current state-of-the-art HTS wire has a value of 
And the product of coil mass and radius becomes the design parameter.4

MotivationMotivation
 Traditional propulsion uses propellant as a reaction mass
 Advantages
 Ability to move center of mass of spacecraft
(Momentum conserved when  propellant is included)
 Independent (and complete) control of each spacecraft
 Disadvantages
 Propellant is a limited resource
 Momentum conservation requires that the necessary propellant 
mass increase exponentially with the velocity increment ( V)
 Propellant can be a contam inant to precision optics</text>

Possible Solutions for Dealing with the Possible Solutions for Dealing with the 
Earths Magnetic FieldEarths Magnetic Field
 Ignore the disturbance forces from the Earths magnetic field on the 
formation as a whole
 This frees up the arbitrary dipole , but disturbance forces are still 
accounted for.
 Periodically alternate the magnetic  dipole directions, so that the 
accumulated torques average to zero 
 Turn off all the satellites but one, and use the electromagnets like 
torque rods to dump the angular momentum
 Choose the arbitrary dipole wisely so that the total acquired angular 
momentum on the formation is zero
 Choose the arbitrary dipole wisely so that you can use the Earth as 
a dump for angular momentum.</text>

Further Shielding ConsiderationsFurther Shielding Considerations
 Geometry
 Shielding acts to divert field lines around components
 Gentle radii are better for re-direc ting field lines than sharp corners
S i z e
 Smaller radii are more effective, so shielding should envelop the component 
to be protected as closely as possible
 Continuity
 Separate pieces should be effectively connected either mechanically or by 
welding to insure low reluctance
 Closure
 Components should be completely enclos ed, even if by a rectangular box to 
shield all axes
 Openings
 As a rule, fields can extend through a hole ~5x the diameter of the hole
 Nested Shields
 In high field areas, multiple shield layers with air gaps can be used very 
effectively.  Lower permeability, higher  saturation materials should be used 
closer to the high field regions</text>

Divergence of radial separation shows linear control not sufficient in this case.
Redesign with greater penalty on r?
Investigate nonlinear control techniques?
Linear simulation does not capture 
divergence of dynamics.
Initial conditions: 3% deviation from nominal array radius
Radial separation remains stable
Elevation angle of array may go unstable (probably numerical error).

Efficient High Current SuppliesEfficient High Current Supplies
 The existing controller for the testbed was based on a 
pulse width modulated controller found for use with 
radio controlled cars and planes
 An H-bridge is used to alter nate applied potential to the 
coil, with the next current  delivered dependent on the 
amount of time the voltage is applied in a given direction
 The drawback is that current  is always flowing through 
the batteries, which both provide a power sink as well as 
dissipate heat
 One solution may be to incorporate very high Farad 
capacitor instead of a batter , to reduce the internal 
resistance
 Alternatively, a method of  side-stepping the storage 
device altogether may be employed, allowing the 
current to free-wheel during periods of low fluctuation</text>

Initial condition : deviation from nominal state of one or more 
degrees of freedom ( rin the results shown here)
Closed-loop response to perturbed initial condition is simulated
Perhaps offers more insight th an simulating response to random 
disturbances
Results demonstrate:
the range in which the linearized equations are valid
the range in which linear control is sufficient

Solving the EOMSolving the EOM
 For a given instantaneous force profile, there are (3N-3) constraints (EOM), 
and 3N variables (Dipole strengths).
 This allows us to arbitrarily specify one vehicles dipole
 Allows the user the freedom to control other aspects of the formation 
especially angular momentum distribution
 For a specific choice of dipole, there are multiple solutions due to the 
non-linearity of the constraints
 To determine the required magnetic dipole strengths
 Pick the magnetic dipole strengths for one vehicle Set the first equation equal to the desired instantaneous force and solve 
for the remaining magnetic dipole strengths.
 There will be multiple solutions. Pick the solution that is most favorable</text>

 Is there an alternative to using propellant?

 Yes, If an external field exists to conserve momentum
 Otherwise, not that we know of
 Multiple spacecraft
 Yes, again if an external field exists
 OR, if each spacecraft produces  a field that the others can 
react against
 Problem : Momentum conservation pr ohibits control of the 
motion of the center of ma ss of the cluster, since only

Cryogenic ContainmentCryogenic Containment
 Significant research concerning maintaining

 Space Telescope Instrumentation
 Cryogenic propellant storage
 Spacecraft out of Earth orbit can use a sunshield 
that is always sun-pointing to reflect radiant energy 
away
 For Earth orbit operation, this wont work, since 
even Earth albedo will heat the cold side of the 
spacecraft
 A cryogenic containment system, similar in concept to that used for the EMFF  testbed
must be implemented, using a combination of  a reflective outer coating, good insulation, 
and a cyo-cooler to extract heat from the coil
 Using a working fluid to carry heat around to the cry-cooler will be explored, or possibly 
using the wire itself as the thermal conductor</text>

Angular Momentum ManagementAngular Momentum Management
 Being able to control the a ngular momentum gained by the 
individual satellites is cruc ial to the success of EMFF
 Because the torques and forces generated by EMFF are 
internal, there is no way to in ternally remove excess angular 
momentum from the system
 Angular momentum can be transferred from one spacecraft 
to another
 Since EMFF systems do not empl oy thrusters, other innovative 
methods must be used to remove the excess angular 
momentum
 The formation must interact with its environment

Satellite Formation SpinSatellite Formation Spin --UpUp
 Spin-up of complex formations can be achieved by utilizing magnetic dipoles.
 There are a number of possible combi nations of magnet strengths and dipole 
configurations to achieve a given maneuver. 
 These different configurations cause different distribution of angular 
momentum storage.

Degrees of Freedom ValidationDegrees of Freedom Validation
 Initially we had problems demonstrating shear forces
 The reaction wheel is desi gned for small shear forces
 Vehicle tends to stick to table, so larger forces are needed to move the 
vehicle
 Larger shear forces produce larger torques The torque generated would caus e the vehicle to rotate
 As the vehicle rotated, the dipoles al igned causing the vehicles to attract
 Used Vehicles ability to st eer the dipole to compensate

 Satellites are undergoing a specific forcing profile in the presence of 
the Earths magnetic field
 This way the satellites that are not dumping momentum are still being 
disturbed by the Earths magnetic field.
 Each satellite starts off with excess angular momentum
 The satellite with the most excess  momentum is selected for angular

ConclusionsConclusions
 There are many types of missions that can benefit from propellantless
relative control between satellites
 Provides longer lifetime (even for aggressive maneuvers)
 Reduces contamination and degradation
 Angular momentum management is an important issue, and methods are 
being developed to de-saturate the reaction wheels without using thrusters
 Preliminary experimental results indicate that we are able to perform 
disturbance rejection in steady stat e spin dynamics for multiple satellites
 Optimal system sizing has been determined for relatively small satellite 
arrays. Currently larger formations are being investigated
 Although low frequency magnetic interference data is difficult to find, 
shielding against the relatively low fields inside the coils appears to be 
possible
 Preliminary validation with the MIT Testbed has been achieved, and more 
complex maneuver profiles will be accomplished with future upgrades</text>

are not aligned.
 Torques are also produced when the shear

 The torques on each dipole is not usually equal

 Even for pure shear forces,  ( Fx= 0) one can 
arbitrarily pick one of the dipole angles.1

Question III:Question III:
 What forces must be transmitted between satellites to allow for all relative 
degrees of freedom to be controlled?
 In 2-D, Nspacecraft have 3 NDOFs, but we are only interested in 
controlling (and are able to control) 3 N-2 (no translation of the center of 
mass)
 For 2 spacecraft, thats a total of 4:
 All except case (4) can be generated using axial forces (such as electrostatic 
monopoles) and torques provided by reaction wheels
 Complete instantaneous control require s a transverse force, which can be 
provided using either electrostatic or electromagnetic dipoles1 2 3 4</text>

 Monochromatic emissivity = 
monochromatic absorptivity
 However, emissivity and absorptivity for a 
given material vary with wavelength
 E.g., white paint s=0.4, IR=0.8
At a given frequency, Kirchoffs law says that the emissivity and absorbtivity will 
be the same.  
White paint on spacecraft will have a lo w equilibrium temperature because it 
absorbs little energy in the frequencies of  the solar spectra, but may have a high 
emissivity at the IR frequencies associated with the bodies temperature.

At any temperature above absolute zer o, all materials emit thermal (blackbody) 
radiation.  
For a perfect blackbody, the rate of to tal energy emission  and the energy 
distribution across all wavelengths is stric tly a function of the absolute temperature 
T.
For spacecraft and atmosphere covere d planets these distributions are 
modified, but we usually use the perfect blackbody energy distribution at least as an 
initial estimate.
Plancks equation gives us the spectral energy distribution of a
perfect blackbody.  Ebis the energy per unit wavelength of a blackbody.

Multi-Functional Structures (MFS)
Conventional design uses structur e to support avionics card cages, 
antennas, wire bundles, etc.  Stru cture usually accounts for ~15% of 
spacecraft bus mass
MFS build circuitry directly into the structur e, etch antenna patterns into 
the surface, etc thereby eliminating need for a considerable amount of 
support structure
Imagine computer boards mounted to gether to form the spacecraft bus
Launch Load Alleviation

the dynamic (&gt;60g) and acoustic load s (160 dBa)during the eight minute

If the bandwidth (maxim um frequenc y at which control authority is 
significant) of a control loop is near the resonances of a flexible 
structural mode, detri mental inte raction can occur:  instability
Conventional practice is to limit the frequency where the open loop 
transfer function has dropped by  3 dB to less than one-tenth the first 
flexible mode in the system.
Advanced controls have proven to be  effective well beyond this frequency 
if the structural dynamic s are properly considered.</text>

          <text>[D] Tether Vibration Control[D] Tether Vibration Control
Tether vibrations can disturb the 
stability of the optical train and 
therefore need to be controlled.
One option for controlling tether 
vibration is impedance matching.
Tether vibration is fundamentally 
governed by the wave behavior of a 
string under tension.
For each tether, motion can be 
decomposed into leftward and 
rightward propagating waves.
A transformation between physical 
and wave states in the tether can be 
derived.
As these waves propagate and 
interfere with each other, they 
induce detrimental motion into 
elements attached to the tether.2</text>

Sunshields
To observe in the thermal infrared 
requires cold optics and detectors
Sunshie lds are us ed to block 
sunlight fro m heating thes e 
elements
Need to be large and lightweight
Thermal Snap
The hea t load into a structure c an 
change due to Eart h eclipse in LEO 
or due to a slew of the S/C
Nonzero or differential coefficient 
of therm al expansion (CTE) can 
cause stresses to build
Friction joints in deployment 
mechanis ms can eventually slip 
causing an i mpulsive input
This high frequency vibration can 
disturb precision instrum entsTherm al Flutter
Differential thermal expansion can 
cause a portion of the structure to 
curve and reduce its exposure to a 
heat source
The structure then curves back 
thereby increasing its heat load
This can lead to a low frequency 
instability (flutter)
Thermal Distortions
Differential thermal expansion in 
optics and optical mounts can 
dramatically degrade perfor mance
Kine maticmounts ensure that only 
only 6-DOF loads are applied 
thereby holding th e optics 6-DOF 
in place without applying bending 
and shearing loads</text>

	When does it make sense to invest in a space project? 
	When the expected return on investment in the pr oject is greater than the re turn from investing the 
same amount of capital at the interest rate.

          <text>Cost Estimating Methods 
1) Detailed Bottom-Up Cost Estimating 
	Most accurate, most time consuming 
	Applied after an architecture has been selected and the 
design is mature 
2) Analogous Estimating 
	Can be applied at any level of design 
	Inflexible for trade studies 
3) Parametric Estimation 
	Cost Estimation Relationships (CERs) 
	Best for trade studies during the Conceptual Design Phase

	Plays a major role in the allocation of resources for expensive, 
long-term space projects. 
	Why will an organization incur debt? 
The benefit of using the money now is greater than the interest paid. 
	Why is a given amount of $ t oday worth more than the same 
amount of $ in the future?
1) Inflation
2) $ can be used to increase productivity now.
	Compound Interest Formula 
F= P(1+i)t 
where:	 F= future value of m oney P= present value of money 
i= interest rate t= investment/project lifetime

          <text>Graduate Student Labor Rates
	Many program costs are dominated by  the labor costs of the standing 
army times the duration of the program (e.g., operations) 
	Labor costs consist of salary times wraps (e.g., overhead and employee benefits) 
	Overhead includes real estate taxes, facility maintenance, aspects of administration, 
etc. 
	Employee benefits include re tirement fund contributions,  paid vacation, continuing 
education, sometimes health plans 
	How much does a graduate student at MIT cost per year? 
	$1,475 (PhD) or $1,335 (SM) st ipend per month before taxes 
	MIT overhead is 63.5% 
	Tuition is $1,887 per month 
	Only stipend is subject to overhead $/ yr=[(1475*1.635)+1887]*12 =$51,584 per year 
	What about staff 
	Assume a salary of $50, 000 per year before taxes 
	Cost to contract is salary ti mes overhead times employee benefits 
	$/year = $50000*1.635*1. 377 = $50000*2.25 = $112,570 
	Only labor is subject to employee benefits 
	Travel, materials, labor, etc. are subject to overhead 
	Fabricated equipment and subcontracts beyond first $25k are exempt from 
overhead</text>

          <text>Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs)
Aparametric cost model is a series of mathematical 
relationships that relate spacecraft cost to physical, technical, 
and performance parameters. 
	Cost Estimation Relationships (CERs) show how the cost properties of the system or subs ystem vary with characteristic 
parameters. 
	Wraps typically account for approximately 30% of the development cost for space systems. 
	Requires a historical database. 
	Based on regression analysis &amp; the correlation of data. 
	Cost=a+bMcPd 
	To be used as a comparison tool, not a budgeting tool.

 Lossless compression
 Ensures data recovered is exactly same as original data
 Used for executable code, numeric data -- cannot tolerate 
mistakes
 Lossy compression
 Does not promise that data received is the same as data sent Removes information that cannot later be restored Used for still images, video, audio - Data contains more info than 
human can perceive
 Data may already contain errors/imperfections Better compression ratios than Lossless (order of magnitude)</text>

Modulation - DPCM
 Represent differences between data 
 Output reference symbol
 For each symbol in data, output difference between it and 
reference symbol: AAABBCDDDD -&gt; A0001123333
 When differences are small, encode with fewer bits (2 
bits vs 8 bits)
 Takes advantage of fact that adjacent pixels are similar -
1.5-to-1
Delta encoding encodes symbol as difference from 
previous one:  AAABBCDDDD -&gt; A001011000.
 Works well when adjacent pixels are similar
 Can combine delta encoding and RLE</text>

          <text>Dictionary-Based Methods
 Lempel-Ziv (LZ) most well known, used by Unix 
compress command
 Build dictionary of expected data strings
 Replace strings with index to dictionary
 Example:  "compression" (77-bits of 7-bit ASCII) has 
index 4978 (15 bits) in /usr/share/dict/words -- 5-to-1
compression ratio
 How is the dictionary built?
 A priori, static, tailored to data
 Adaptively define based on contents of data.  However, 
dictionary must be sent with data for proper decompression</text>

          <text>Why Compress Data
 Need to send more data than bandwidth 
accommodates
 Digital image files in particular are very large
 Bandwidth is limited by the link equation 
and international regulation

 Compression beneficial when

Where Bc= data bandwidth through compress/decompressprocess
Bn= network bandwidth for uncompressed data
r = average compression ratio
x / Bn= time to send x bytes of uncompressed data

In most cases, the spacecraft operations control center controls the overall mission, 
even though the payload is the reason for the mission.  The SOCC monitors the 
health and status of the bus and, in some architectures, the payload as well. 
Sometimes its a multi-mi ssion facility, and many times is separated physically 
from the payload operations control center.

6/17/2004	 6 
The entire focus of the POCC is the pa yload, its monitoring, management and 
control.
The mission control center would be res ponsible for the entire constellation of 
satellites.
The SOCC, the POCC and the MCC are many times not co-located.
When the availability requirement is ve ry high we may specify multiple systems 
running in parallel (hot spares) to mini mize the downtime in case of a failure.

These are the important factors in ground station design.  The spacecraft orbit and 
mission characteristics will drive available locations for ground systems. 
Satellite transmitter characteristics and data rates will determine the ground 
systems transmitter and receiver operating characteristics. 
Because the facilities that process data may not be co-located with the receiving 
system, the ground system wi ll have its own terrestrial and space communication 
links.

          <text>Design Considerations 
	Required satellite coverage determines the 
number and location of ground stations 
 LEOs are particularly demanding because of 
short and infrequent contact opportunities 
 Large quantities of mission  data must be stored 
on board and downlinked in short periods 
 Infrequent TT&amp;C contact demands more on-
board autonomy

          <text>(Dis) advantages of RTGs
Advantages
 Do not require sunlight to operate
 Long lasting and relatively insensitive 
to the chilling cold of space and 
virtually invulnerable to high 
radiation fields.
 RTGs provide longer mission 
lifetimes than solar power systems.
 Supplied with RTGs, the Viking 
landers operated on Mars for four and 
six years, respectively.
 By comparison, the 1997 Mars 
Pathfinder spacecraft, which used 
only solar and battery power, operated only three months.
 They are lightweight and compact.  In 
the kilowatt range, RTGs provide
more power for less mass (when 
compared to solar arrays and 
batteries). No moving parts or fluids, 
conventional RTGs highly reliable. 
 RTGs are safe and flight-proven.
They are designed to withstand any launch and re-entry accidents. 
 RTGs are maintenance free..
Disadvantages
 The nuclear decay process cannot be 
turned on and off.  An RTG is active 
from the moment when the 
radioisotopes are inserted into the 
assembly, and the power output 
decreases exponentially with time.
 An RTG must be cooled and shielded 
constantly.
 The conversion efficiency is normally 
only 5 %.
 Radioisotopes, and hence the RTGs
themselves, are expensive</text>

          <text>Flywheel Energy Storage Modules (FESM) could 
replace batteries on Earth-orbit satellites.
 While in sunlit orbit, the motor will spin the 
flywheel to a fully charged speed
 generator mode will take over to discharge the 
flywheel and power the satellite during the eclipse 
phase
 present flywheel technology is about four times better 
than present battery technology on a power stored vs. weight comparison.
 Weighing less than 130 lbs, the FESM is 18.4-in. in 
diameter by 15.9-in. in length
 Delivers 2 kW-hr of useful energy for a typical 37-
minute LEO eclipse cycle
 high speeds of up to 60,000 rpm
 the current average for commercial GSO storage is 
2,400 lbs of batteries, which is decreased to 720 lbs 
with an equivalent FESM.

 Earths magnetic field concentrates on large fluxes of 
electrons, protons and some heavy ions.
 Radiation belt particles spiral back and forth along 
magnetic field lines.
 Ionizing radiation belts reach lowest altitude of the eastern 
coast of the eastern coast of South America (SAA).

31 Plasma is caused by UV, EUV, X-ray photoelectric 
effect on atmospheric molecules.
 Breaks diatomic molecule bonds.
 Ejects electrons from outer shells.
 As UV, EUV, X-ray penetrate the atmosphere, ion 
density increases with atmospheric density until most 
UV, EUV have been absorbed (&gt;60 Km altitude). Varies dramatically with altitude, latitude, magnetic 
field strength, time of day and solar activity. 
 Electrically charged region of atmosphere is called the 
ionosphere.
 Gas in ionosphere is called ionospheric plasma.</text>
