          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 2 
8.2 Words: Holomorphic and meromorphic 
Denition. A function that is analytic on a region  is called holomorphic on . 
A function that is analytic on  except for a set of poles of nite order is called meromorphic on . 
Example 8.2. Let 
 + 2+ 3 
 () = (  2)(  3)(  4)(  5). 
This is meromorphic on  with (simple) poles at  = 2, 3, 4, 5. 
8.3 Behavior of functions near zeros and poles 
The basic idea is that near a zero of order , a function behaves like (  0) and near a pole of order 
, a function behaves like 1(  0). The following make this a little more precise. 
Behavior near a zero. If  has a zero of order  at 0 then near 0, 
 ()  (  0), 
for some constant . 
Proof. By denition  has a Taylor series around 0 of the form 
 () = (  0) + +1(  0)+1 +  
( ) +1 +2 = (  0) 1 + (  0) + (  0)2 +    
Since the second factor equals 1 at 0, the claim follows. 
Behavior near a nite pole. If  has a pole of order  at 0 then near 0, 
  ()  , (  0) 
for some constant . 
Proof. This is nearly identical to the previous argument. By denition  has a Laurent series around 
0 of the form 
 1 1  () = + +  + + 0+  (  0) (  0)1   0 ( )  1 2 = 1 + (  0) + (  0)2 +  (  0)   
Since the second factor equals 1 at 0, the claim follows. 
8.3.1 Picards theorem and essential singularities 
Near an essential singularity we have Picards theorem. We wont prove or make use of this theorem
in 18.04. Still, we feel it is pretty enough to warrant showing to you. 
Picards theorem. If  () has an essential singularity at 0 then in every neighborhood of 0,  () 
takes on all possible values innitely many times, with the possible exception of one value. 
Example 8.3. It is easy to see that in any neighborhood of  = 0 the function  = e1 takes every 
value except  = 0.</text>

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 16 
On the other hand, the interior of the curve  is everything outside of . There are no poles of  
in that region. If we want the residue theorem to hold (which we do its that important) then the
only option is to have a residue at  and dene it as we did. 
The denition of the residue at innity assumes all the poles of  are inside . Therefore the residue 
theorem implies  
Res( , ) =  the residues of  . 
To make this useful we need a way to compute the residue directly. This is given by the following 
theorem. 
Theorem. If  is analytic in  except for a nite number of singularities then 
( 1 ) 
Res(, ) =  Res  (1), 0 . 2 
Proof. The proof is just a change of variables:  = 1. 
Change of variable:  = 1 
First note that  = 1 and 
 = (1 2) . 
Next, note that the map  = 1 carries the positively oriented -circle of radius  to the negatively 
oriented -circle of radius 1. (To see the orientiation, follow the circled points 1, 2, 3, 4 on  in 
the -plane as they are mapped to points on  in the -plane.) Thus, 
1 Res( , ) =  1  ()  =  (1)1  2  2   2  
 Finally, note that  = 1 maps all the poles inside the circle  to points outside the circle . So 
  the only possible pole of (12) (1) that is inside  is at  = 0. Now, since  is oriented 
clockwise, the residue theorem says 
( ) 
1 1  (1)1  =  Res  (1), 0 2  2 2 
Comparing this with the equation just above nishes the proof. 
Example 8.23. Let 
5  2  () = (  1). 
Earlier we computed 
 ()  = 10 =2</text>

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 14 
where,     2 = 1. 
Solution: Let 
1  () = (  2)4 . 
The singularity at  = 0 is outside the contour of integration so it doesnt contribute to the integral. 
To use the residue theorem we need to nd the residue of  at  = 2. There are a number of ways to 
do this. Heres one: 
1 1 =  2 + (  2) 
1 1 =2  1 + (  2)2 ( ) 
1 (  2)2 (  2)3 
= 1    2 +  +  2 2 4 8 
This is valid on 0 &lt;   2 &lt; 2. So, 
1 1 1 1 1 1  () =  =  +  +  (  2)4  2(  2)4 4(  2)3 8(  2)2 16(  2) 
Thus, Res(, 2) = 116 and 
 ()  = 2 Res(, 2) =  
8 .  
Example 8.22. Compute 
1   sin() 
over the contour  shown. 
Solution: Let 
 () = 1 sin(). 
There are 3 poles of  inside  at 0,  and 2. We can nd the residues by taking the limit of 
(  0) (). Each of the limits is computed using LHospitals rule. (This is valid, since the rule is</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 5 
Solution: Using partial fractions we write 
 1 1 1 1  () = =  +  . (  )( + ) 2    2  +  
The poles are at  = . We compute the residues at each pole: 
At  = : 
 () = 1  1+ something analytic at . 2    
Therefore the pole is simple and Res( , ) = 12. 
At  = : 
 () = 1  1+ something analytic at . 2  +  
Therefore the pole is simple and Res( , ) = 12. 
Example 8.8. Mild warning! Let 
1  () =  (1  ) 
then we have the following Laurent expansions for  around  = 0. 
On 0 &lt;  &lt; 1: 
1 = 1  () = 1  (1 +  + 2 + ).  1    
Therefore the pole at  = 0 is simple and Res(, 0) = 1. 
On 1 &lt;  &lt; : ( ) 1 1 1 1  () =  = 1 + 1+ +  . 2 1  1 2  2 
Even though this is a valid Laurent expansion you must not use it to compute the residue at 0. This is
because the denition of residue requires that we use the Laurent series on the region 0 &lt;   0 &lt; 
. 
Example 8.9. Let 
 () = log(1 + ). 
This has a singularity at  = 1, but it is not isolated, so not a pole and therefore there is no residue 
at  = 1. 
8.4.1 Residues at simple poles 
Simple poles occur frequently enough that well study computing their residues in some detail. Here
are a number of ways to spot a simple pole and compute its residue. The justication for all of them
goes back to Laurent series. 
Suppose  () has an isolated singularity at  = 0. Then we have the following properties. 
Property 1. If the Laurent series for  () has the form 
1 + 0+ 1(  0) +    0 
then  has a simple pole at 0 and Res(  , 0) = 1.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>14</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 15 
just a statement about power series. We could also have used Property 5 from the section on residues
of simple poles above.) 
At  = 0:  1 lim = lim = 1. 
0 sin() 0 cos() 
Since the limit exists,  = 0 is a simple pole and 
Res(, 0) = 1. 
At  = :    1 lim = lim = 1 . 
 sin()  cos() 
Since the limit exists,  =  is a simple pole and 
Res(, ) = 1. 
At  = 2: The same argument shows 
Res(, 2) = 1 . 
Now, by the residue theorem 
 ()  = 2 [Res(, 0) + Res(, ) + Res(, 2)] = 2.  
8.6 Residue at  
The residue at  is a clever device that can sometimes allow us to replace the computation of many
residues with the computation of a single residue. 
Suppose that  is analytic in  except for a nite number of singularities. Let  be a positively 
oriented curve that is large enough to contain all the singularities. 
All the poles of  are inside  
Denition. We dene the residue of  at innity by 
Res(, ) =  1  () . 2  
We should rst explain the idea here. The interior of a simple closed curve is everything to left as you
traverse the curve. The curve  is oriented counterclockwise, so its interior contains all the poles of 
 . The residue theorem says the integral over  is determined by the residues of these poles.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>7</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 8 
At  = 2: 1 () = (  2) () = (2 + 1)(  2) 
is not analytic at 2, so the pole is not simple. (It should be obvious that its a pole of order 2.) 
Example 8.13. Let (),  () be analytic at  = 0. Assume (0)  0, (0) = 0,  (0)  0. Find 
() Res 
=0 (). 
Solution: Since  (0)  0,  has a simple zero at 0. So 1 has a simple pole at 0 and 
1 Res(1, 0) =  (0) 
Since (0)  0 we know 
(0) Res(, 0) = (0) Res(1, 0) =  (0). 
8.4.2 Residues at nite poles 
For higher-order poles we can make statements similar to those for simple poles, but the formulas
and computations are more involved. The general principle is the following 
Higher order poles. If  () has a pole of order  at 0 then 
() = (  0) () 
is analytic at 0 and if 
() = 0+ 1(  0) +  
then 
(1)(0) Res(, 0) = 1 = . (  1)! 
Proof. This is clear using Taylor and Laurent series for  and  . 
Example 8.14. Let 
sinh()  () = 5 
and nd the residue at  = 0. 
Solution: We know the Taylor series for 
sinh() =  + 33! + 55! +  
(You can nd this using sinh() = (e  e)2 and the Taylor series for e.) Therefore, 
1 1 1  () = + + +  4 3!2 5! 
We see Res(, 0) = 0.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>9</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 10 
Solution: Since cot( ) has a simple pole at 0 we know 
1 cot() = + 0+ 1 + 22+   
We also know 
cos() 1  22 + 44!   cot() = = sin()   33! + 55!   
Cross multiplying the two expressions we get
( ) ( ) 1   3 5 4 
+ 0+ 1 + 22+  +   = 1  2
+    3! 5! 2 4! 
We can do the multiplication and equate the coecients of like powers of . 
( )( )( ) 1 0 1 1 4 
1+ 0 +  + 1 2+  + 2 3+  + 3 4 = 1  2
+ 3! 3! 5! 3! 2! 4! 
So, starting from 1= 1 and 0= 0, we get 
13! + 1 = 12!  1 = 13 
03! + 2= 0  2= 0 
15!  13! + 3 = 14!  3 = 145 . 
As noted above, all the even terms are 0 as they should be. We have 
1   3 
cot() = +   3 45 
8.5 Cauchy Residue Theorem 
This is one of the major theorems in 18.04. It will allow us to make systematic our previous somewhat
ad hoc approach to computing integrals on contours that surround singularities. 
Theorem. (Cauchys residue theorem ) Suppose  () is analytic in the region  except for a set of 
isolated singularities. Also suppose  is a simple closed curve in  that doesnt go through any of 
the singularities of  and is oriented counterclockwise. Then 
 ()  = 2  
residues of  inside   
Proof. The proof is based of the following gures. They only show a curve with two singularities
inside it, but the generalization to any number of signularities is straightforward. In what follows we
are going to abuse language and say pole when we mean isolated singularity, i.e. a nite order pole
or an essential singularity (innite order pole).</text>

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 17 
by computing residues at  = 0 and  = 1. Recompute this integral by computing a single residue 
at innity. 
Solution: 
1 1 5  2 5  2  (1) = = 2 2 (1)(1  1) (1  ). 
We easily compute that 
( 1 ) 
Res( , ) =  Res  (1), 0 = 5 . 2 
Since  = 2 contains all the singularities of  we have 
 ()  = 2 Res(, ) = 10. =2 
This is the same answer we got before!</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>11</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 12 
Solution: The poles of  () are at  = 0, . Using the residue theorem we just need to compute the 
residues of each of these poles. 
At  = 0: 1 () =  () = 2+ 1 
is analytic at 0 so the pole is simple and 
Res(, 0) = (0) = 1. 
At  = : 1 () = (  ) () = ( + ) 
is analytic at  so the pole is simple and 
Res(, ) = () = 12. 
At  = : 1 () = ( + ) () = (  ) 
is analytic at  so the pole is simple and 
Res( , ) = () = 12. 
Using the residue theorem we have 
 ()  = 0 (since  is analytic inside 1) 1 
 ()  = 2 Res(, ) =   2 
 ()  = 2 [Res(, ) + Res(, 0)] =  3 
 ()  = 2 [Res(, ) + Res(, 0) + Res(, )] = 0. 4

          <slideno>6</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 7 
The second factor on the right is analytic at 0 and equals 1 at 0. Therefore we know the Laurent 
expansion of 1 is ( ) 1 1 = 1 + 1(  0) +  () 1(  0) 
Clearly the residue is 11 = 1  (0). QED. 
Example 8.10. Let 
2 +  + 2 
 () = (  2)(  3)(  4)(  5). 
Show all the poles are simple and compute their residues. 
Solution: The poles are at  = 2, 3, 4, 5. They are all isolated. Well look at  = 2 the others are 
similar. Multiplying by   2 we get 
2 +  + 2 
() = (  2) () = (  3)(  4)(  5). 
This is analytic at  = 2 and 
8 = 4 (2) = 3. 6 
So the pole is simple and Res(, 2) = 43 . 
Example 8.11. Let 
1  () = sin(). 
Find all the poles and their residues. 
Solution: The poles of  () are the zeros of sin(), i.e.  for  an integer. Since the derivative 
sin() = cos( )  0, 
the zeros are simple and by Property 5 above 
1 Res(, ) = = (1). cos( ) 
Example 8.12. Let 
1  () = (2 + 1)(  2)2 . 
Identify all the poles and say which ones are simple. 
Solution: Clearly the poles are at  = 0, , 2. 
At  = 0: 
() =  () 
is analytic at 0 and (0) = 14. So the pole is simple and the residue is (0) = 14. 
At  = : 1 () = (  ) () = ( + )(  2)2 
is analytic at , the pole is simple and the residue is (). 
At  = : This is similar to the case  = . The pole is simple.</text>

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 4 
What is the importance of the residue? If  is a small, simple closed curve that goes counterclockwise 
around 1 then 
 () = 21.  
 small enough to be inside   0 &lt; , surround 0 and contain no other singularity of  . 
This is easy to see by integrating the Laurent series term by term. The only nonzero integral comes
from the term 1. 
Example 8.5. 
 () = e12 = 1 + 1+ 1 +  2 2(2)2 
has an isolated singularity at 0. From the Laurent series we see that Res(, 0) = 12. 
Example 8.6. 
(i) Let 
1 2 4  () = + + + 5 + 6. 3 2  
 has a pole of order 3 at  = 0 and Res( , 0) = 4. 
(ii) Suppose 
2  () = + (),  
where  is analytic at  = 0. Then,  has a simple pole at 0 and Res(, 0) = 2. 
(iii) Let 
 () = cos() = 1  22! +  . 
Then  is analytic at  = 0 and Res(, 0) = 0. 
(iv) Let ( ) sin() 1  () = =   3
+  = 1  2 
+    3! 3! 
So,  has a removable singularity at  = 0 and Res( , 0) = 0.

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 6 
Property 2 If 
() = (  0) () 
is analytic at 0 then 0 is either a simple pole or a removable singularity. In either case Res( , 0) = 
(0). (In the removable singularity case the residue is 0.) 
Proof. Directly from the Laurent series for  around 0. 
Property 3. If  has a simple pole at 0 then 
lim (  0) () = Res(, 0) 
0 
This says that the limit exists and equals the residue. Conversely, if the limit exists then either the
pole is simple, or  is analytic at 0. In both cases the limit equals the residue. 
Proof. Directly from the Laurent series for  around 0. 
Property 4. If  has a simple pole at 0 and  () is analytic at 0 then 
Res( , 0) = (0) Res(, 0). 
If (0)  0 then 
1 Res( , 0) = Res(, 0). (0) 
Proof. Since 0 is a simple pole, 
1  () = + 0+ 1(  0)   0 
Since  is analytic, 
() = 0+ 1(  0) +  , 
where 0= (0). Multiplying these series together it is clear that 
Res(, 0) = 01= (0) Res( , 0). QED 
The statement about quotients   follows from the proof for products because 1 is analytic at 
0. 
Property 5. If () has a simple zero at 0 then 1 () has a simple pole at 0 and 
1 Res(1 , 0) =  (0). 
Proof. The algebra for this is similar to what weve done several times above. The Taylor expansion 
for  is 
() = 1(  0) + 2(  0)2 +  , 
where 1=  (0). So 
1 1 =

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 11 
The left gure shows the curve  surrounding two poles 1 and 2 of  . The right gure shows 
the same curve with some cuts and small circles added. It is chosen so that there are no poles of 
 inside it and so that the little circles around each of the poles are so small that there are no other
poles inside them. The right hand curve is 
 = 1+ 2 3 2+ 4+ 5 6 5 
The left hand curve is  = 1+4. Since there are no poles inside  we have, by Cauchys theorem, 
 ()  = 1+232+4+565  ()  = 0   
Dropping 2 and 5, which are both added and subtracted, this becomes 
 ()  = 3+6  ()  (1) 1+4 
If 2 1  () =  + + + 0+ 1(  1) +  (  1)2   1 
is the Laurent expansion of  around 1 then 
2 1  ()  = 3 + + + 0+ 1(  1) +   3(  1)2   1 
= 21 
= 2 Res(, 1) 
Likewise 
 ()  = 2 Res(, 2). 6 
Using these residues and the fact that  = 1+ 4, Equation 1 becomes 
 ()  = 2 Res(, 1) + Res( , 2) .  [ ]
That proves the residue theorem for the case of two poles. As we said, generalizing to any number
of poles is straightforward.

Solution: Let 
5  2  () = (  1). 
The poles of  are at  = 0, 1 and the contour encloses them both. 
At  = 0: 5  2 () =  () = (  1) 
is analytic at 0 so the pole is simple and 
Res(, 0) = (0) = 2. 
At  = 1: 5  2 () = (  1) () =  
is analytic at 1 so the pole is simple and 
Res(, 1) = (1) = 3. 
Finally 
5  2  = 2 [Res(, 0) + Res(, 1)] = 10.  (  1) 
Example 8.20. Compute 
2 sin(1) . =1 
Solution: Let

 has an isolated singularity at  = 0. Using the Taylor series for sin() we get 
(1 1 1 ) 16 2 sin(1) = 2 +   =   +   3!3 5!5  
So, Res(, 0) = 1 = 16 . Thus the residue theorem gives

8 Residue Theorem 
8.1 Poles and zeros 
We remind you of the following terminology: Suppose  () is analytic at 0 and 
 () = (  0) + +1(  0)+1 +  , 
with   0. Then we say  has a zero of order  at 0. If  = 1 we say 0 is a simple zero. 
Suppose  has an isolated singularity at 0 and Laurent series 
 1 1  () = + +  + + 0+ 1(  0) +  (  0) (  0)1   0 
which converges on 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  and with   0. Then we say  has a pole of order  at 0. 
If  = 1 we say 0 is a simple pole. 
There are several examples in the Topic 7 notes. Here is one more 
Example 8.1. 
 + 1  () = 3(2 + 1) 
has isolated singularities at  = 0,  and a zero at  = 1. We will show that  = 0 is a pole of 
order 3,  =  are poles of order 1 and  = 1 is a zero of order 1. The style of argument is the 
same in each case. 
At  = 0: 1  + 1  () =  . 3 2+ 1 
Call the second factor  (). Since  () is analytic at  = 0 and  (0) = 1, it has a Taylor series 
 + 1 () = = 1 + 1 + 22+  2+ 1 
Therefore 1 1 2  () = + + +  . 3 2  
This shows  = 0 is a pole of order 3. 
1 +1 At  = :  () =  . Call the second factor (). Since () is analytic at  = , it has a  3(+) 
Taylor series 
 + 1 () = = 0+ 1(  ) + 2(  )2 +  3( + ) 
where 0= ()  0. Therefore 
0  () = + 1+ 2(  ) +  .    
This shows  =  is a pole of order 1. 
The arguments for  =  and  = 1 are similar.

          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 3 
8.3.2 Quotients of functions 
We have the following statement about quotients of functions. We could make similar statements if
one or both functions has a pole instead of a zero. 
Theorem. Suppose  has a zero of order  at 0 and  has a zero of order  at 0. Let 
 () () = () . 
Then 
 If  &gt;  then () has a pole of order    at 0. 
 If  &lt;  then () has a zero of order    at 0. 
 If  =  then () is analytic and nonzero at 0. 
We can paraphrase this as () has pole of order    at 0. If    is negative then the pole 
is actually a zero. 
Proof. You should be able to supply the proof. It is nearly identical to the proofs above: express  
and  as Taylor series and take the quotient. 
Example 8.4. Let 
sin() () = . 2 
We know sin() has a zero of order 1 at  = 0 and 2 has a zero of order 2. So, () has a pole of 
order 1 at  = 0. Of course, we can see this easily using Taylor series 
( ) 
1 () =   3 
+  2 3! 
8.4 Residues 
In this section well explore calculating residues. Weve seen enough already to know that this will
be useful. We will see that even more clearly when we look at the residue theorem in the next section. 
We introduced residues in the previous topic. We repeat the denition here for completeness. 
Denition. Consider the function  () with an isolated singularity at 0, i.e. dened on the region 
0 &lt;   0 &lt;  and with Laurent series (on that region) 
      () = + (  0). (  0) 
=1 =0 
The residue of  at 0 is 1. This is denoted 
Res(, 0) = 1 or Res  = 1. 
=0</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>8</slideno>
          <text>8 RESIDUE THEOREM 9 
Note, we could have seen this by realizing that  () is an even function. 
Example 8.15. Let 
sinh()e 
 () = . 5 
Find the residue at  = 0. 
Solution: It is clear that Res(, 0) equals the coecient of 4 in the Taylor expansion of sinh()e. 
We compute this directly as 
( ) ( )( 1 ) 3 2 31 sinh()e =  + +  1 +  + + +  =  + + 4+  3! 2 3! 4! 3! 
So 1 1 5 Res(, 0) = + = 3! 4! 24. 
Example 8.16. Find the residue of 
1  () = (2 + 1)(  2)2 
at  = 2. 
1 Solution: () = (  2)2 () = is analytic at  = 2. So, the residue we want is the 1 term (2+1) 
in its Taylor series, i.e.  (2). This is easy, if dull, to compute 
Res(, 2) =  (2) =  13 
100 
8.4.3 cot() 
The function cot() turns out to be very useful in applications. This stems largely from the fact that
it has simple poles at all multiples of  and the residue is 1 at each pole. We show that rst. 
Fact.  () = cot() has simple poles at  for  an integer and Res(, ) = 1. 
Proof. 
cos()  () = sin() . 
This has poles at the zeros of sin, i.e. at  = . At poles  is of the form  where  has a simple 
zero at 0 and (0)  0. Thus we can use the formula 
(0) Res( , 0) =  (0). 
In our case, we have 
cos( ) Res(, ) = = 1, cos( ) 
as claimed. 
Sometimes we need more terms in the Laurent expansion of cot(). There is no known easy formula
for the terms, but we can easily compute as many as we need using the following technique. 
Example 8.17. Compute the rst several terms of the Laurent expansion of cot() around  = 0.</text>

          <text>7 TAYLOR AND LAURENT SERIES 8 
Solution: We have to manipulate this into standard geometric series form. 
(( ) ( )2 ( ) 3 ) 
1   5   5   5  () = = 11  +  +  4(1 + (  5)4) 4 4 4 4 
Since  () has a singularity at  = 1 the radius of convergence is  = 4. We can also see this by 
considering the geometric series. The geometric series ratio is (  5)4. So the series converges 
when   54 &lt; 1, i.e. when   5 &lt; 4, i.e.  = 4. 
Disk of convergence stops at the singularity at  = 1. 
Example 7.13. Find the Taylor series for 
 () = log(1 + ) 
around  = 0. Give the radius of convergence. 
Solution: We know that  is analytic for  &lt; 1 and not analytic at  = 1. So, the radius of 
convergence is  = 1. To nd the series representation we take the derivative and use the geometric 
series. 
 () = 1= 1   + 2 3+ 4  1 +  
Integrating term by term (allowed by Theorem 7.1) we have 
 3
 4 
 () = 0+   2
+ +  = 0 + (1)1  
2 3 4  =1 
Here 0 is the constant of integration. We nd it by evalating at  = 0. 
 (0) = 0 = log(1) = 0. 
Disk of convergence for log(1 + ) around  = 0. 
Example 7.14. Can the series  
(  2) 
converge at  = 0 and diverge at  = 3. 
Solution: No! We have 0= 2. We know the series diverges everywhere outside its radius of 
convergence. So, if the series converges at  = 0, then the radius of convergence is at least 2. Since 
3  0 &lt; 2 we would also have that  = 3 is inside the disk of convergence.</text>

Combining these two formulas we have 
  1  ()    
 () =  = + (  0) 
2 13    (  0) 
=1 =0 
The last thing to note is that the integrals dening  and  do not depend on the exact radius of 
the circle of integration. Any circle inside  will produce the same values. We have proved all the
statements in the theorem on Laurent series. QED 
7.7.1 Examples of Laurent series 
In general, the integral formulas are not a practical way of computing the Laurent coecients. In-
stead we use various algebraic tricks. Even better, as we shall see, is the fact that often we dont 
really need all the coecients and we will develop more techniques to compute those that we do
need. 
Example 7.20. Find the Laurent series for 
 + 1  () =  
around 0= 0. Give the region where it is valid. 
Solution: The answer is simply 
 () = 1 + 1 .  
This is a Laurent series, valid on the innite region 0 &lt;  &lt; . 
Example 7.21. Find the Laurent series for 
 () =  
2+ 1 
around 0= . Give the region where your answer is valid. Identify the singular (principal) part. 
Solution: Using partial fractions we have 
1 1 1 1  () =  +  . 2    2  +  
Since 1 is analytic at  =  it has a Taylor series expansion. We nd it using geometric series.  +  
( ) 1 1 1 1   =  =  +  2 1 + (  )(2) 2 =0 2 
So the Laurent series is  (  ) 1 1 1     () =  + 2    4 2 =0 
The singular (principal) part is given by the rst term. The region of convergence is 0 &lt;    &lt; 2. 
Note. We could have looked at  () on the region 2 &lt;    &lt; . This would have produced a
dierent Laurent series. We discuss this further in an upcoming example.

7.9.2 Residues 
In preparation for discussing the residue theorem in the next topic we give the denition and an 
example here. 
Note well, residues have to do with isolated singularites. 
Denition 7.31. Consider the function  () with an isolated singularity at 0, i.e. dened on 0 &lt; 
  0 &lt;  and with Laurent series 
      () = + (  0). (  0) 
=1 =0 
The residue of  at 0 is 1. This is denoted 
Res(, 0) or Res  = 1. 
=0 
What is the importance of the residue? If  is a small, simple closed curve that goes counterclockwise 
around 0 then 
 () = 21.  
 is small enough to be inside   0 &lt; , and surround 0. 
This is easy to see by integrating the Laurent series term by term. The only nonzero integral comes
from the term 1. 
Example 7.32. The function 
 () = e1(2)= 1 + 1+ 1 +  2 2(2)2 
has an isolated singularity at 0. From the Laurent series we see that 
1 Res(, 0) = 2.

guments regarding convergence and manipulation of series. In particular it will dene the notion</text>

7.5 Taylor series examples 
The uniqueness of Taylor series along with the fact that they converge on any disk around 0 where 
the function is analytic allows us to use lots of computational tricks to nd the series and be sure
that it converges. 
Example 7.7. Use the formula for the coecients in terms of derivatives to give the Taylor series 
of  () = e around  = 0. 
Solution: Since  () = e, we have  ()(0) = e0 = 1. So, 
 
e 2 3  
= 1 +  + + +  = 2! 3! ! =0 
Example 7.8. Expand  () = 8e3 in a Taylor series around  = 0. 
Solution: Let  = 3. So, 
     3 3 = e e = =  
! ! =0 =0 
Thus, 
 3 
 () = +8 . ! =0 
Example 7.9. Find the Taylor series of sin() around  = 0 (Sometimes the Taylor series around 0 
is called the Maclaurin series.) 
Solution: We give two methods for doing this. 
Method 1. 
{ 
 sin() (1) for  = 2 + 1 = odd,  = 0, 1, 2,   ()(0) = =  0 for  even 
Method 2. Using 
e  e 
sin() = , 2 
we have [ ] 
   1 ()  () 1 
sin() =  = [(1  (1))] 
2 ! ! 2 ! =0 =0 =0 
(We need absolute convergence to add series like this.) 
Conclusion:  2+1  
sin() = (1) 
(2 + 1)!, 
=0 
which converges for  &lt; .

Some simple algebra now gives us the formula in Equation 1. 
Denition. An innite geometric series has the same form as the nite geometric series except there 
is no last term:  
 =  +  + 2+  =  . 
=0 
Note. We will usually simply say geometric series instead of innite geometric series. 
Theorem. If  &lt; 1 then the innite geometric series converges to 
   =   
 = (2) 1   =0 
If   1 then the series does not converge. 
Proof. This is an easy consequence of the formula for the sum of a nite geometric series. Simply 
let    in Equation 1. 
Note. We have assumed a familiarity with convergence of innite series. We will go over this in
more detail in the appendix to this topic. 
7.2.1 Connection to Cauchys integral formula 
Cauchys integral formula says 
1  ()  () = . 2     
Inside the integral we have the expression 
1 
   
which looks a lot like the sum of a geometric series. We will make frequent use of the following
manipulations of this expression. 
( ) 1 1 1 1 =  = 1 + () + ()2 +  (3)     1    
The geometric series in this equation has ratio . Therefore, the series converges, i.e. the formula 
is valid, whenever  &lt; 1, or equivalently when 
 &lt; . 
Similarly, ( ) 1 1 = 1  = 1 1 + () + ()2 +  (4)     1    
The series converges, i.e. the formula is valid, whenever  &lt; 1, or equivalently when 
 &gt; .</text>

The coecients have the formulus 
1  ()  =  2  (  0)+1 
 =1  ()(  0)1 , 2  
where  is any circle   0 =  inside the annulus, i.e. 1 &lt;  &lt; 2. 
Furthermore 
 
 The series (  0) converges to an analytic function for   0 &lt; 2. 
=0 
   The series converges to an analytic function for   0 &gt; 1. 
=1 (  0) 
 Together, the series both converge on the annulus  where  is analytic. 
The proof is given below. First we dene a few terms. 
Denition. The entire series is called the Laurent series for  around 0. The series 
 
(  0) 
=0 
is called the analytic or regular part of the Laurent series. The series 
  
=1 (  0) 
is called the singular or principal part of the Laurent series. 
Note. Since  () may not be analytic (or even dened) at 0 we dont have any formulas for the 
coecients using derivatives. 
Proof. (Laurent series). Choose a point  in . Now set circles 1 and 3 close enough to the 
boundary that  is inside 1+ 2 3 2 as shown. Since this curve and its interior are contained 
in , Cauchys integral formula says 
1  ()  () =  2 1+232

The integrals over 2 cancel, so we have 
1  ()  () = . 2 13    
Next, we divide this into two pieces and use our trick of converting to a geometric series. The 
calculuations are just like the proof of Taylors theorem. On 1 we have 
  0 &lt; 1,   0 
so 
1  () 1  () 1

 ( )  1  () =  (  0) 
2 1(  0)+1 
=0 
 
= (  0). 
=0 
Here  is dened by the integral formula given in the statement of the theorem. Examining the 
above argument we see that the only requirement on  is that   0 &lt; 2. So, this series converges 
for all such . 
Similarly on 3 we have 
  0 &lt; 1,   0 
so 
1  () 1  () 1 
2 3     =2 3   0  (

=0 
 ( )  
=  1  ()(  0)  (  0)1 
2 1 =0 
  =  . 
=1 (  0) 
In the last equality we changed the indexing to match the indexing in the statement of the theorem.
Here  is dened by the integral formula given in the statement of the theorem. Examining the 
above argument we see that the only requirement on  is that   0 &gt; 1. So, this series converges 
for all such .</text>

7 Taylor and Laurent series 
7.1 Introduction 
We originally dened an analytic function as one where the derivative, dened as a limit of ratios,
existed. We went on to prove Cauchys theorem and Cauchys integral formula. These revealed 
some deep properties of analytic functions, e.g. the existence of derivatives of all orders. 
Our goal in this topic is to express analytic functions as innite power series. This will lead us to
Taylor series. When a complex function has an isolated singularity at a point we will replace Taylor
series by Laurent series. Not surprisingly we will derive these series from Cauchys integral formula. 
Although we come to power series representations after exploring other properties of analytic func-
tions, they will be one of our main tools in understanding and computing with analytic functions. 
7.2 Geometric series 
Having a detailed understanding of geometric series will enable us to use Cauchys integral formula
to understand power series representations of analytic functions. We start with the denition: 
Denition. A nite geometric series has one of the following (all equivalent) forms. 
 = (1 +  + 2+ 3+  + ) 
=  +  + 2+ 3+  +  
 
=  
=0 
 
=   
=0 
The number  is called the ratio of the geometric series because it is the ratio of consecutive terms 
of the series. 
Theorem. The sum of a nite geometric series is given by 
(1  +1)  = (1 +  + 2+ 3+  + ) = . (1) 1   
Proof. This is a standard trick that youve probably seen before. 
 = +  + 2+  +  
 =  + 2+  +  ++1 
When we subtract these two equations most terms cancel and we get 
   =   +1

around  = 0. 
Solution: Note that  has a singularity at 0, so we cant expect a convergent Taylor series expansion.
Well aim for the next best thing using the following shortcut. 
[ ] 
1 2(1 + 2)  1 1 1  () = = 2  . 3 1 + 2 3 1 + 2 
Using the geometric series we have 
 1 1 (2) = = = 1  2+ 4 6+  1 + 2 1  (2) =0 
Putting it all together 
( )( 1 )  
 () = 1 2  1 + 2 4+  = +1  (1)2+1 
3 3  =0 
Note. The rst terms are called the singular part, i.e. those with negative powers of . The sum-
mation is called the regular or analytic part. Since the geometric series for 1(1 + 2) converges for 
 &lt; 1, the entire series is valid in 0 &lt;  &lt; 1 
Example 7.11. Find the Taylor series for 
e 
 () = 1   
around  = 0. Give the radius of convergence. 
Solution: We start by writing the Taylor series for each of the factors and then multiply them out. 
( )( ) 2 3 
 () = 1 +  + + +  1 +  + 2+ 3+  2! 3! 
( ) ( ) 1 = 1 + (1 + 1)  + 1 + 1 + 1 2+ 1 + 1 + 1+ 3+  2! 2! 3! 
The biggest disk around  = 0 where  is analytic is  &lt; 1. Therefore, by Taylors theorem, the 
radius of convergence is  = 1. 
 () is analytic on  &lt; 1 and has a singularity at  = 1.

7.3 Convergence of power series 
When we include powers of the variable  in the series we will call it a power series. In this section 
well state the main theorem we need about the convergence of power series. Technical details will
be pushed to the appendix for the interested reader. 
Theorem 7.1. Consider the power series 
 
 () = (  0) . 
=0 
There is a number   0 such that: 
1. If  &gt; 0 then the series converges absolutely to an analytic function for   0 &lt; . 
2. The series diverges for 0 &gt; .  is called the radius of convergence. The disk 0 &lt; 
 is called the disk of convergence. 
3. The derivative is given by term-by-term dierentiation 
 
 () = (  0)1 
=0 
 The series for  also has radius of convergence . 
4. If  is a bounded curve inside the disk of convergence then the integral is given by term-by -
term integration 
 
 ()  = (  0) 
  =0 
Notes. 
 The theorem doesnt say what happens when   0 = . 
 If  =  the function  () is entire. 
 If  = 0 the series only converges at the point  = 0. In this case, the series does not represent 
an analytic function on any disk around 0. 
 Often (not always) we can nd  using the ratio test. 
The proof of this theorem is in the appendix. 
7.3.1 Ratio test and root test 
Here are two standard tests from calculus on the convergence of innite series. 
Ratio test. Consider the series  . If  = lim +1 exists, then: 0 
1. If  &lt; 1 then the series converges absolutely.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>7 TAYLOR AND LAURENT SERIES 4 
2. If  &gt; 1 then the series diverges. 
3. If  = 1 then the test gives no information. 
Note. In words,  is the limit of the absolute ratios of consecutive terms. 
Again the proof will be in the appendix. (It boils down to comparison with a geometric series.) 
Example 7.2. Consider the geometric series 1 +  + 2+ 3+ . The limit of the absolute ratios 
of consecutive terms is 
 = lim +1 =  
 
Thus, the ratio test agrees that the geometric series converges when  &lt; 1. We know this converges 
to 1(1  ). Note, the disk of convergence ends exactly at the singularity  = 1. 
  
Example 7.3. Consider the series  () = ! . The limit from the ratio test is 
=0 
+1( + 1)!   = lim = lim = 0. 
 !  + 1 
Since  &lt; 1 this series converges for every . Thus, by Theorem 7.1, the radius of convergence for 
this series is . That is,  () is entire. Of course we know that  () = e. 
Root test. Consider the series  . If  = lim 1 exists, then: 0 
1. If  &lt; 1 then the series converges absolutely. 
2. If  &gt; 1 then the series diverges. 
3. If  = 1 then the test gives no information . 
Note. In words,  is the limit of the th roots of the (absolute value) of the terms. 
The geometric series is so fundamental that we should check the root test on it. 
Example 7.4. Consider the geometric series 1 +  + 2+ 3+ . The limit of the th roots of the 
terms is 
 = lim 1 = lim  =  
 
Happily, the root test agrees that the geometric series converges when  &lt; 1. 
7.4 Taylor series 
The previous section showed that a power series converges to an analytic function inside its disk of 
convergence. Taylors theorem completes the story by giving the converse: around each point of 
analyticity an analytic function equals a convergent power series.

7.9.1 Examples of poles 
Well go back through many of the examples from the previous sections. 
Example 7.25. The rational function 
1 + 22 
 () = 3+ 5 
expanded to 
)  
 () = +1 (1)2+1 . ( 1  
3  =0 
Thus,  = 0 is a pole of order 3. 
Example 7.26. Consider 
 + 1  () = = 1 + 1 .   
Thus,  = 0 is a pole of order 1, i.e. a simple pole. 
Example 7.27. Consider 
 1 1  () = =  + (), 2+ 1 2    
where  () is analytic at  = . So,  =  is a simple pole. 
Example 7.28. The function 
1  () = (  1) 
has isolated singularities at  = 0 and  = 1. Show that both are simple poles. 
Solution: In a neighborhood of  = 0 we can write 
() 1  () = , where () =    1. 
Since () is analytic at 0,  = 0 is a nite pole. Since (0)  0, the pole has order 1, i.e. it is simple. 
Likewise, in a neighborhood of  = 1, 
()  () = where () = 1 .   1,  
Since  is analytic at  = 1,  has a nite pole there. Since (1)  0 it is simple. 
Example 7.29. Consider 
1 1 1 e = 1 + 1+ + +   2!2 3!3 
So,  = 0 is an essential singularity. 
Example 7.30. log() has a singularity at  = 0. Since the singularity is not isolated, it cant be
classied as either a pole or an essential singularity.</text>

of uniform convergence. The short description is that all of our manipulations of power series are
justied on any closed bounded region. Almost, everything we did can be restricted to a closed disk
or annulus, and so was valid.</text>

  ()(0) = (  0)

ties give Taylors formula. QED 
7.6 Singularities 
Denition. A function  () is singular at a point 0 if it is not analytic at 0 
Denition. For a function  (), the singularity 0 is an isolated singularity if  is analytic on the 
deleted disk 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  for some  &gt; 0. 
 + 1 Example 7.15.  () = has isolated singularities at  = 0, . 3(2 + 1) 
Example 7.16.  () = e1 has an isolated singularity at  = 0. 
Example 7.17.  () = log() has a singularity at  = 0, but it is not isolated because a branch cut, 
starting at  = 0, is needed to have a region where  is analytic. 
Example 7.18.  () = 1 has singularities at  = 0 and  = 1 for  = 1, 2,  The sin( ) 
singularities at 1 are isolated, but the one at  = 0 is not isolated. 
Every neighborhood of 0 contains zeros at 1 for large . 
7.7 Laurent series 
Theorem 7.19. (Laurent series) . Suppose that  () is analytic on the annulus 
  1 &lt;   0 &lt; 2. 
Then  () can be expressed as a series 
      () = + (  0). (  0) 
=1 =0</text>

          <text>7 TAYLOR AND LAURENT SERIES 14 
on the region   0 &lt;  &lt; 1 centered at  = 0. 
Solution: This function has isolated singularities at  = 0, . Therefore it is analytic on the region 
. 
 () has singularities at  = 0, . 
At  = 0 we have 
 () = 1 
3 (1 + )(1  2 + 4  6 + ). 
Multiplying this out we get 
1 1  () = + 1 1 +  + 2 3  . 3 2  
The following example shows that the Laurent series depends on the region under consideration. 
Example 7.23. Find the Laurent series around  = 0 for  () = 1 in each of the following (  1) 
regions: 
(i) the region 1 0 &lt;  &lt; 1 
(ii) the region 2 1 &lt;  &lt; . 
Solution: For (i) 
1  () = 1  = 1(1 +  + 2+ ) = 1  1    2   1     
For (ii): Since the usual geometric series for 1(1  ) does not converge on 2 we need a dierent 
form, ( ) 1 1 1 1  () =  = 1 + 1+ +   (1  1) 2  2 
Since 1 &lt; 1 on 2 our use of the geometric series is justied. 
One lesson from this example is that the Laurent series depends on the region as well as the formula
for the function. 
7.8 Digression to dierential equations 
Here is a standard use of series for solving dierential equations. 
Example 7.24. Find a power series solution to the equation 
 () =  () + 2,  (0) = 0.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>14</slideno>
          <text>7 TAYLOR AND LAURENT SERIES 15 
Solution: We look for a solution of the form 
 
 () = . 
=0 
Using the initial condition we nd  (0) = 0 = 0. Substituting the series into the dierential 
equation we get 
 () = 1+ 22 + 333+  =  () + 2 = 0+ 2 + 1 + 22+  
Equating coecients and using 0= 0 we have 
1= 0+ 2  1 = 2 
22= 1  2= 12 = 1 
33= 2  3 = 13 
44= 3  4 = 1(3  4) 
In general 
 1 ( + 1)+1 =   +1= = ( + 1) 3  4  5  ( + 1). 
You can check using the ratio test that this function is entire. 
7.9 Poles 
Poles refer to isolated singularities. So, we suppose  () is analytic on 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  and has 
Laurent series       () = + (  0). (  0) 
=1 =0 
Denition of poles. If only a nite number of the coecients  are nonzero we say 0 is a nite 
pole of  . In this case, if   0 and  = 0 for all  &gt;  then we say 0 is a pole of order . 
 If 0 is a pole of order 1 we say it is a simple pole of  . 
 If an innite number of the  are nonzero we say that 0 is an essential singularity or a pole 
of innite order of  . 
 If all the  are 0, then 0 is called a removable singularity. That is, if we dene  (0) = 0 
then  is analytic on the disk   0 &lt; . 
The terminology can be a bit confusing. So, imagine that I tell you that  is dened and analytic on 
the punctured disk 0 &lt;   0 &lt; . Then, a priori we assume  has a singularity at 0. But, if after
computing the Laurent series we see there is no singular part we can extend the denition of  to 
the full disk, thereby removing the singularity. 
We can explain the term essential singularity as follows. If  () has a pole of order  at 0 then 
(  0) () is analytic (has a removable singularity) at 0. So,  () itself is not much harder to 
work with than an analytic function. On the other hand, if 0 is an essential singularity then no 
algebraic trick will change  () into an analytic function at 0.</text>

where the series converges on any disk   0 &lt;  contained in . Furthermore, we have formulas 
for the coecients 
 ()(0) 1  ()  = = . (5) ! 2  (  0)+1 
(Where  is any simple closed curve in  around 0, with its interior entirely in .) 
We call the series the power series representing  around 0. 
The proof will be given below. First we look at some consequences of Taylors theorem. 
Corollary. The power series representing an analytic function around a point 0 is unique. That is, 
the coecients are uniquely determined by the function  (). 
Proof. Taylors theorem gives a formula for the coecients. 
7.4.1 Order of a zero 
Theorem. Suppose  () is analytic on the disk   0 &lt;  and  is not identically 0. Then there 
is an integer   0 such that   0 and  has Taylor series around 0 given by 
 
 () = (  0)( + +1(  0) + ) = (  0)  
(  0). (6) 
= 
Proof. Since  () is not identically 0, not all the Taylor coecients are zero. So, we take  to be the 
index of the rst nonzero coecient. 
Theorem 7.6. Zeros are isolated. If  () is analytic and not identically zero then the zeros of  are 
isolated. (By isolated we mean that we can draw a small disk around any zeros that doesnt contain
any other zeros.) 
Isolated zero at 0:  (0) = 0,  ()  0 elsewhere in the disk. 
Proof. Suppose  (0) = 0. Write  as in Equation 6. There are two factors: 
(  0) 
and 
() =  + +1(  0) +  
Clearly (0)  0 if   0. We have (0) =   0, so () is not 0 on some small neighborhood 
of 0. We conclude that on this neighborhood the product is only zero when  = 0, i.e. 0 is an 
isolated 0. 
Denition. The integer  in Theorem 7.6 is called the order of the zero of  at 0. 
Note, if  (0)  0 then 0 is a zero of order 0.</text>

7.5.1 Proof of Taylors theorem 
For convenience we restate Taylors Theorem 7.5. 
Taylors theorem. (Taylor series) Suppose  () is an analytic function in a region . Let 0 . 
Then, 
 
 () = (  0), 
=0 
where the series converges on any disk   0 &lt;  contained in . Furthermore, we have formulas 
for the coecients 
 ()(0) 1  ()  = =  (7) ! 2  (  0)+1 
Proof. In order to handle convergence issues we x 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; . We let  be the circle 
  0 = 2 (traversed counterclockise). 
Disk of convergence extends to the boundary of  
1 &lt; 2 &lt; , but 1 and 2 can be arbitrarily close to . 
Take  inside the disk   0 &lt; 1. We want to express  () as a power series around 0. To do 
this we start with the Cauchy integral formula and then use the geometric series. 
As preparation we note that for  on  and   0 &lt; 1 we have 
  0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2=   0, 
so   0 &lt; 1.   0

1.9.2 Potential Theorem 
Here is an application of Greens theorem which tells us how to spot a conservative eld on a simply
connected region. The theorem does not have a standard name, so we choose to call it the Potential
Theorem. 
Theorem Rev.7. (Potential Theorem) Take  =(, ) dened and dierentiable on a region . 
(a) If  =  then curl =    = 0. 
(b) If  is simply connected and curl = 0 on  , then  =  for some  . 
We know that on a connected region, being a gradient eld is equivalent to being conservative. So we
can restate the Potential Theorem as: on a simply connected region,  is conservative is equivalent 
to curl = 0. 
( ) 
Proof of (a):  = ,  , so curl  =    = 0. 
Proof of (b): Suppose  is a simple closed curve in . Since  is simply connected the interior 
of  is also in  . Therefore, using Greens theorem we have,

1.7.2 Fundamental theorem for gradient elds 
Theorem Rev.4. (Fundamental theorem for gradient elds) 
If  =  then     =  ( )   (), where ,  are the beginning and endpoints respectively  
of . 
Proof. By the chain rule we have 
 (()) =  (())   () = (())   ().  
The last equality follows from our assumption that  =  . Now we can this when we compute the 
line integral: 
 
   =  (())   ()    
  (())  =    
=  (())   (()) 
=  ( )   () 
Notice that the third equality follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
Denition. If a vector eld  is a gradient eld, with  =  , then we call  a a potential function 
for . 
Note: the usual physics terminology would be to call  the potential function for . 
1.7.3 Path independence and conservative functions 
Denition. For a vector eld , the line integral     is called path independent if, for any two 
points  and , the line integral has the same value for every path between  and . 
Theorem.     is path independent is equivalent to     = 0 for any closed path. 
Sketch of proof. Draw two paths from  to  . Following one from  to  and the reverse of the 
other back to  is a closed path. The equivalence follows easily. We refer you to the more detailed 
review of line integrals and Greens theorem for more details. 
Denition. A vector eld with path independent line integrals, equivalently a eld whose line inte-
grals around any closed loop is 0 is called a conservative vector eld. 
Theorem Rev.5. We have the following equivalence: On a connected region, a gradient eld is 
conservative and a conservative eld is a gradient eld. 
Proof. Again we refer you to the more detailed review for details. Essentially, if  is conservative 
then we can dene a potential function  (, ) as the line integral of  from some base point to (, ).

Jeremy Orlo 
1 Review of multivariable calculus (18.02) constructs 
1.1 Introduction 
These notes are a terse summary of what well need from multivariable calculus. If, after reading
these, some parts are still unclear, you should consult your notes or book from your multivariable
calculus or ask about it at oce hours. Weve also posted a more detailed review of line integrals
and Greens theorem. You should consult that if needed. 
Weve seen that complex exponentials make trigonometric functions easier to work with and give
insight into many of the properties of trig functions. Similarly, well eventually reformulate some
material from 18.02 in complex form. Well see that its easier to present and the main properties 
are more transparent in complex form. 
1.2 Terminology and notation 
Vectors. Well denote vectors in the plane by (, ) 
Note. In physics and in 18.02 we usually write vectors in the plane as  + . This use of  and  
would be confusing in 18.04, so we will write this vector as (, ). 
In 18.02 you might have used angled brackets ,  for vectors and round brackets (, ) for points.
In 18.04 we will adopt the more standard mathematical convention and use round brackets for both
vectors and points. It shouldnt lead to any confusion. 
Orthogonal. Orthogonal is a synonym for perpendicular. Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot 
product is zero, i.e.  = (1, 2) and  = (1, 2) are orthogonal if 
   = (1, 2)  (1, 2) = 11+ 22= 0. 
Composition. Composition of functions will be denoted  (()) or  (), which is read as  
composed with  
1.3 Parametrized curves 
We often use the greek letter gamma for a paramtrized curve, i.e. 
() = ((), ()). 
We think of this as a moving point tracing out a curve in the plane. The tangent vector 
 () = ( (),  ()) 
is tangent to the curve at the point ((), ()). Its length  () is the instantaneous speed of the 
moving point.

Note. The curl is a scalar. In 18.02 and in general, the curl of a vector eld is another vector eld. 
However, for vectors elds in the plane the curl is always in the  direction, so we have simply 
dropped the  and made curl a scalar. 
Divergence. The divergence of the vector eld  = (, ) is 
div =  + . 
1.6 Level curves 
Recall that the level curves of a function  (, ) are the curves given by  (, ) = constant. 
Recall also that the gradient  is orthogonal to the level curves of  
1.7 Line integrals 
The ingredients for line (also called path or contour) integrals are the following: 
 A vector eld  = (, ) 
 A curve  () = ( (), ()) dened for      
Then the line integral of  along  is dened by 
 
   =  (())   () =   + .   
Example Rev.3. Let  = (2, 2) and let  be the unit circle. Compute line integral of  along 
. 
Solution: You should be able to supply the answer to this example 
1.7.1 Properties of line integrals 
1. Independent of parametrization. 
2. Reverse direction on curve  change sign. That is,

1.9.4 Extended Greens Theorem 
We can extend Greens theorem to a region  which has multiple boundary curves. 
Suppose  is the region between the two simple closed curves 1 and 2. 
C1
C2RC1
C2C3C4R
(Note  is always to the left as you traverse either curve in the direction indicated.) 
Then we can extend Greens theorem to this setting by 
curl .    + 2    =  1 
Likewise for more than two curves: 
curl .    + 2    + 3    + 4    =  1 
Proof. The proof is based on the following gure. We cut both 1 and 2 and connect them by two 
copies of 3, one in each direction. (In the gure we have drawn the two copies of 3 as separate 
curves, in reality they are the same curve traversed in opposite directions.) 
Now the curve  = 1+ 3+ 2 3 is a simple closed curve and Greens theorem holds on it. 
But the region inside  is exactly  and the contributions of the two copies of 3 cancel. That is, 
we have shown that 
curl  = 1+3+23    = 1+2   .  
This is exactly Greens theorem, which we wanted to prove.</text>

1.9 Extensions and applications of Greens theorem 
1.9.1 Simply connected regions 
Denition: A region  in the plane is simply connected if it has no holes. Said dierently, it is 
simply connected for every simple closed curve  in , the interior of  is fully contained in . 
Examples: 
D1
D2
D3
xy
D4
xy
D5= whole
plane
D1-D5 are simply connected. For any simple closed curve  inside any of these regions the interior 
of  is entirely inside the region. 
Note. Sometimes we say any curve can be shrunk to a point without leaving the region. 
The regions below are not simply connected. For each, the interior of the curve  is not entirely in 
the region.</text>

(ii) The circle of radius 1 around  = 3. 
(iii) The unit circle. 
Solution: For parts (i) and (ii) there is no problem using the antiderivative log() because these 
curves are contained in a simply connected region that doesnt contain the origin. 
(i)  1   = log(1 + )  log(1) = log( 2) +  4 .   
(ii) Since the beginning and end points are the same, we get 
1  = 0   
(iii) We parametrize the unit circle by () = e with 0    2. We compute  () = e. So the 
integral becomes 
2 2 1 1  =  e  =    = 2. e   0 0 
Notice that we could use log() if we were careful to let the argument increase by 2 as it went 
around the origin once. 
1 Example 3.12. Compute  , where  is the unit circle in two ways. 2 
(i) Using the fundamental theorem. 
(ii) Directly from the denition. 
Solution: (i) Let  () = 1. Since  () = 12, the fundamental theorem says 
1  =   ()  =  (endpoint)   (start point) = 0.  2 
It equals 0 because the start and endpoints are the same. 
(ii) As usual, we parametrize the unit circle as () = e with 0    2. So,  () = e and the 
integral becomes 
2 2 2 1 1 
2  =  e  =  e  = e = 0.  0 e2 0 0 
3.6 Cauchys theorem 
Cauchys theorem is analogous to Greens theorem for curl free vector elds. 
Theorem 3.13. (Cauchys theorem) Suppose  is a simply connected region,  () is analytic on  
and  is a simple closed curve in . Then the following three things hold: 
(i)   ()  = 0 
(i) We can drop the requirement that  is simple in part (i). 
(ii) Integrals of  on paths within  are path independent. That is, two paths with the same endpoints 
integrate to the same value.</text>

Similarly, we get (remember:  =  + , so  =  )

  (,  + ) + (,  + )   0 = lim

Together Equations 5 and 6 show 
 1   () = =    
 By Equation 2a we have shown that  is analytic and  =  .  
3.7 Extensions of Cauchys theorem 
Cauchys theorem requires that the function  () be analytic on a simply connected region. In cases 
where it is not, we can extend it in a useful way. 
Suppose  is the region between the two simple closed curves 1 and 2. Note, both 1 and 2 are 
oriented in a counterclockwise direction. 
Theorem 3.14. (Extended Cauchys theorem) If  () is analytic on  then 
 ()  = 0. 12 
Proof. The proof is based on the following gure. We cut both 1 and 2 and connect them by two 
copies of 3, one in each direction. (In the gure we have drawn the two copies of 3 as separate 
curves, in reality they are the same curve traversed in opposite directions.) 
With 3 acting as a cut, the region enclosed by 1+ 3 2 3 is simply connected, so Cauchys 
Theorem 3.13 applies. We get 
 ()  = 0 1+323</text>

          <text>3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHYS THEOREM 10 
By the extended Cauchy theorem we have 
2 
 ()  = 3  ()  =    = 2. 2 0 
Here, the line integral for 3 was computed directly using the usual parametrization of a circle. 
Answer to the question: The only possible values are 0 and 2. 
We can extend this answer in the following way: 
If  is not simple, then the possible values of 
 ()   
are 2, where  is the number of times  goes (counterclockwise) around the origin 0. 
Denition.  is called the winding number of  around 0.  also equals the number of times  
crosses the positive -axis, counting +1 for crossing from below and 1 for crossing from above.

C
A curve with winding number 2 around the origin. 
Example 3.16. A further extension: using the same trick of cutting the region by curves to make it
simply connected we can show that if  is analytic in the region  shown below then 
 ()  = 0. 1234

That is, 1 2 3 4 is the boundary of the region . 
Orientation. It is important to get the orientation of the curves correct. One way to do this is to 
make sure that the region  is always to the left as you traverse the curve. In the above example. 
The region is to the right as you traverse 2, 3 or 4 in the direction indicated. This is why we put 
a minus sign on each when describing the boundary.</text>

          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHYS THEOREM 3 
Proof. This is an application of the chain rule. We have 
 (()) =  (())  ().  
So 
    (())  ()  =   (())  ()  =   =  (()) =  (1)   (0).      
 Another equivalent way to state the fundamental theorem is: if  has an antiderivative  , i.e.  =  
then 
 ()  =  (1)   (0).  
Example 3.6. Redo  2 , with  the straight line from 0 to 1 + . 
Solution: We can check by inspection that 2 has an antiderivative  () = 33. Therefore the 
fundamental theorem implies 
1+ 3 (1 + )3 2(1 + ) 2  = = = .  3 0 3 3 
Example 3.7. Redo  2 , with  the unit circle. 
Solution: Again, since 2 had antiderivative 33 we can evaluate the integral by plugging the end-
points of  into the 33. Since the endpoints are the same the resulting dierence will be 0! 
3.4 Path independence 
We say the integral   ()  is path independent if it has the same value for any two paths with the 
same endpoints. More precisely, if  () is dened on a region  then   ()  is path independent 
in , if it has the same value for any two paths in  with the same endpoints. 
The following theorem follows directly from the fundamental theorem. The proof uses the same 
argument as Example 3.7. 
Theorem 3.8. If  () has an antiderivative in an open region , then the path integral   ()  is 
path independent for all paths in . 
Proof. Since  () has an antiderivative of  (), the fundamental theorem tells us that the integral 
only depends on the endpoints of  , i.e. 
 ()  =  (1)   (0)  
where 0 and 1 are the beginning and end point of . 
An alternative way to express path independence uses closed paths. 
Theorem 3.9. The following two things are equivalent.</text>

          <text>3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHYS THEOREM 6 
(iii)  has an antiderivative in . 
Proof. We will prove (i) using Greens theorem  we could give a proof that didnt rely on Greens,
but it would be quite similar in avor to the proof of Greens theorem. 
Let  be the region inside the curve. And write  =  + . Now we write out the integral as follows 
 ()  =  ( + ) ( + ) =  (    ) + (  +  ).  
Lets apply Greens theorem to the real and imaginary pieces separately. First the real piece: 
     =  (  )   = 0.  
We get 0 because the Cauchy-Riemann equations say  = , so    = 0. 
Likewise for the imaginary piece: 
  +   =  (  )   = 0.  
We get 0 because the Cauchy-Riemann equations say  = , so    = 0. 
To see part (i) you should draw a few curves that intersect themselves and convince yourself that
they can be broken into a sum of simple closed curves. Thus, (i) follows from (i).1 
Part (ii) follows from (i) and Theorem 3.9. 
To see (iii), pick a base point 0  and let 
 
 () =   () . 
0 
Here the integral is over any path in  connecting 0 to . By part (ii),  () is well dened. If we 
can show that  () =  () then well be done. Doing this amounts to managing the notation to
apply the fundamental theorem of calculus and the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So, lets write 
 () = (, ) + (, ),  () = (, ) +  (, ). 
Then we can write  =  + , etc.  
We can formulate the Cauchy-Riemann equations for  () as 
 1   () = = (2a)    
i.e. 
 () =  +  = 1( + ) =   . (2b)  
1In order to truly prove part (i) we would need a more technically precise denition of simply connected so we could 
say that all closed curves within  can be continuously deformed to each other.</text>

          <text>3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHYS THEOREM 4 
1. The integral   ()  is path independent. 
2. The integral   ()  around any closed path is 0. 
Proof. This is essentially identical to the equivalent multivariable proof. We have to show two 
things: 
(i) Path independence implies the line integral around any closed path is 0. 
(ii) If the line integral around all closed paths is 0 then we have path independence. 
To see (i), assume path independence and consider the closed path  shown in gure (i) below. Since 
the starting point 0 is the same as the endpoint 1 the line integral   ()  must have the same 
value as the line integral over the curve consisting of the single point 0. Since that is clearly 0 we 
must have the integral over  is 0. 
To see (ii), assume   ()  = 0 for any closed curve. Consider the two curves 1 and 2 shown 
in gure (ii). Both start at 0 and end at 1. By the assumption that integrals over closed paths are 
0 we have 12  ()  = 0. So, 
 ()  = 2  () . 1 
That is, any two paths from 0 to 1 have the same line integral. This shows that the line integrals 
are path independent.

Example 3.10. Why cant we compute    using the fundamental theorem. 
Solution: Because  doesnt have an antiderivative. We can also see this by noting that if  had an 
antiderivative, then its integral around the unit circle would have to be 0. But, we saw in Example
3.4 that this is not the case.

3 Line integrals and Cauchys theorem 
3.1 Introduction 
The basic theme here is that complex line integrals will mirror much of what weve seen for multi-
variable calculus line integrals. But, just like working with  is easier than working with sine and
cosine, complex line integrals are easier to work with than their multivariable analogs. At the same
time they will give deep insight into the workings of these integrals. 
To dene complex line integrals, we will need the following ingredients: 
 The complex plane:  =  +  
 The complex dierential  =  +  
 A curve in the complex plane: () = () + (), dened for     . 
 A complex function:  () = (, ) + (, ) 
3.2 Complex line integrals 
Line integrals are also called path or contour integrals. Given the ingredients we dene the complex 
line integral   ()  by 
 
 ()  =   (()) () . (1a)   
You should note that this notation looks just like integrals of a real variable. We dont need the 
vectors and dot products of line integrals in 2. Also, make sure you understand that the product 
 (()) () is just a product of complex numbers. 
An alternative notation uses  =  +  to write 
 ()  =  ( + )( + ) (1b)  
Lets check that Equations 1a and 1b are the same. Equation 1b is really a multivariable calculus 
expression, so thinking of  () as ((), ()) it becomes 
 ( ) 
 ()  =  [((), ()) + ((), ()]  () +  ()    
But, 
((), ()) + ((), ()) =  (()) 
and 
 () +  () =  ()

          <text>3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHYS THEOREM 2 
so the right hand side of this equation is 
 
 (()) () .  
That is, it is exactly the same as the expression in Equation 1a. 
Example 3.1. Compute  2 along the straight line from 0 to 1 + . 
Solution: We parametrize the curve as () = (1 + ) with 0    1. So  () = 1 + . The line 
integral is 
1 2(1 + ) 2 =  2(1 + )2(1 + )  = .  3 0 
Example 3.2. Compute    along the straight line from 0 to 1 + . 
Solution: We can use the same parametrization as in the previous example. So, 
1 
  =  (1  )(1 + )  = 1.  0 
Example 3.3. Compute  2  along the unit circle. 
e Solution: We parametrize the unit circle by () = e, where 0    2. We have  () = . 
So, the integral becomes 
2 2 2 e3 
2  =  e2e  =  e3  = = 0.  0 0 3 0 
Example 3.4. Compute    along the unit circle. 
Solution: Parametrize : () = e, with 0    2. So,  () = e. Putting this into the integral 
gives 
2 2 
  =  e  e  =    = 2.  0 0 
3.3 Fundamental theorem for complex line integrals 
This is exactly analogous to the fundamental theorem of calculus.

tion on an open region  and  is a curve in  from 0 to 1 then

13 Analytic continuation and the Gamma function 
13.1 Introduction 
In this topic we will look at the Gamma function. This is an important and fascinating function that
generalizes factorials from integers to all complex numbers. We look at a few of its many interesting
properties. In particular, we will look at its connection to the Laplace transform. 
We will start by discussing the notion of analytic continuation. We will see that we have, in fact,
been using this already without any comment. This was a little sloppy mathematically speaking and
we will make it more precise here. 
13.2 Analytic continuation 
If we have an function which is analytic on a region , we can sometimes extend the function to be 
analytic on a bigger region. This is called analytic continuation. 
Example 13.1. Consider the function 
 
 () =  e3e . (1) 
0 
We recognize this as the Laplace transform of  () = e3 (though we switched the variable from  
to ). The integral converges absolutely and  is analytic in the region  = {Re() &gt; 3}. 
Can we extend  () to be analytic on a bigger region  ? That is, can we nd a region  a function 
() such that 
1.  contains  
2. () is analytic on  
3. () agrees with  on , i.e. () =  () for   . 
Solution: Yes! We know that  () = 1 valid for any  in . So we can dene () = 1 
  3   3 for any  in  =   {3}. 
We say that we have analytically continued  on  to   on  . 
Note. Usually we dont rename the function. We would just say  () dened by Equation 1 can be 
continued to  () = 1 on  .   3 
Denition. Suppose  () is analytic on a region . Suppose also that  is contained in a region . 
We say that  can be analytically continued from  to  if there is a function () such that 
1. () is analytic on . 
2. () =  () for all  in . 
As noted above, we usually just use the same symbol  for the function on  and its continuation to 
.

Re(z )Im(z )
A B
1
The region  = Re() &gt; 0 is contained in  = Re() &gt; 1. 
Note. We used analytic continuation implicitly in, for example, the Laplace inversion formula in-
1 volving residues of  () = ( ; ). Recall that we wrote that for  () = e3,  () = and 3 
 () =  
residues of  . 
As an integral,  () was dened for Re() &gt; 3, but the residue formula relies on its analytic contin-
uation to   {3}. 
13.2.1 Analytic continuation is unique 
Theorem 13.2. Suppose ,  are analytic on a connected region . If  =  on an open subset of 
 then  =  on all of . 
Proof. Let  =   . By hypothesis () = 0 on an open set in . Clearly this means that the zeros 
of  are not isolated. Back in Topic 7 we showed that for analytic  on a connected region  either 
the zeros are isolated or else  is identically zero on . Thus,  is identically 0, which implies  =  
on . 
Corollary. There is at most one way to analytically continue a function from a region  to a con-
nected region  . 
Proof. Two analytic continuations would agree on  and therefore must be the same. 
Extension. Since the proof of the theorem uses the fact that zeros are isolated, we actually have the
stronger statement: if  and  agree on a nondiscrete subset of  then they are equal. In particular, 
if  and  are two analytic functions on  and they agree on a line or ray in  then they are equal. 
Here is an example that shows why we need  to be connected in Theorem 13.2. 
Example 13.3. Suppose  is the plane minus the real axis. Dene two functions on  as follows. 
{
1 for  in the upper half-plane  () = 0 for  in the lower half-plane 
{
1 for  in the upper half-plane () = 1 for  in the lower half-plane 
Both  and  are analytic on  and agree on an open set (the upper half-plane), but they are not the 
same function.</text>

          <text>13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION 6 
The right side of this equation is analytic on +1. Since it agrees with  on 0 it is an analytic 
continuation to +1. The residue at  is

          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION 3 
Here is an example that shows a little care must be taken in applying the corollary. 
Example 13.4. Suppose we dene  and  as follows 
 () = log() with 0 &lt;  &lt; 2 
() = log() with  &lt;  &lt;  
Clearly  and  agree on the rst quadrant. But we cant use the theorem to conclude that  =  
everywhere. The problem is that the regions where they are dened are dierent.  is dened on  
minus the positive real axis, and  is dened on  minus the negative real axis. The region where 
they are both dened is  minus the real axis, which is not connected. 
Because they are both dened on the upper half-plane, we can conclude that they are the same there.
(Its easy to see this is true.) But (in this case) being equal in the rst quadrant doesnt imply they
are the same in the lower half-plane. 
13.3 Denition and properties of the Gamma function 
Denition. The Gamma function is dened by the integral formula 
 
() =  1e  (2) 
0 
The integral converges absolutely for Re() &gt; 0. 
Properties 
1. () is dened and analytic in the region Re( ) &gt; 0. 
2. ( + 1) = !, for integers   0. 
3. ( + 1) = () (functional equation)
This property and Property 2 characterize the factorial function. Thus, () generalizes ! to 
complex numbers . Some authors will write ( + 1) = !. 
4. () can be analytically continued to be meromorphic on the entire plane with simple poles at 
0, 1, 2 . The residues are 
(1) 
Res(, ) = ! 
[  ( )]1  
e  5. () = 1 +  e , where  is Eulers constant  1 
1 1  = lim 1 + 1 + +   log()  0.577 
 23  
This property uses an innite product. Unfortunately we wont have time, but innte products
represent an entire topic on their own. Note that the innite product makes the positions of 
the poles of  clear. 
 6. ()(1  ) = sin()
With Property 5 this gives a product formula for sin( ).</text>

In particular, !  2+12e. (Stirlings formula ) 
8. 221()( + 12) =  
(2) (Legendre duplication formula ) 
Notes. These are just some of the many properties of (). As is often the case, we could have 
chosen to dene () in terms of some of its properties and derived Equation 2 as a theorem. 
We will prove (some of) these properties below. 
  
Example 13.5. Use the properties of  to show that (12) =  and (32) = 2. 
Solution: From Property 2 we have (1) = 0! = 1. The Legendre duplication formula with  = 12 
then shows (1) (1) 
20 (1) =  
(1)   = . 2 2 
Now, using the functional equation Property 3 we get 
 (3) (1 ) (1)  1  =  + 1 =  = . 2 2 2 2 2 
13.4 Connection to Laplace 
() Claim. For Re( ) &gt; 1 and Re( ) &gt; 0, (1; ) = .  
 
1e . Proof. By denition (1; ) = It is clear that if Re() &gt; 1, then the integral 0 converges absolutely for Re( ) &gt; 0. 
Lets start by assuming that  &gt; 0 is real. Use the change of variable  = . The Laplace integral 
becomes   ( ) 1  
1e  =     1 1e () e = = .       0 0 0 
() This shows that (1; ) = for  real and positive. Since both sides of this equation are  
analytic on Re() &gt; 0, the extension to Theorem 13.2 guarantees they are the same. 
Corollary. () = (1; 1). (Of course, this is also clear directly from the denition of () in 
Equation 2. 
13.5 Proofs of (some) properties of  
Property 1. This is clear since the integral converges absolutely for Re() &gt; 0. 
! Property 2. We know (see the Laplace table) (; ) = . Setting  = 1 and using the corollary +1 
to the claim above we get 
( + 1) = (; 1) = !.

Property 3. We could do this relatively easily using integration by parts, but lets continue using the
Laplace transform. Let  () = . We know 
( + 1) (, ) = +1 
 Now assume Re() &gt; 0, so  (0) = 0. Then  = 1 and we can compute ( ; ) two ways. 
() ( ; ) = (1; ) =  
( + 1) ( ; ) = (; ) =  
Comparing these two equations we get property 3 for Re() &gt; 0. 
Property 4. Well need the following notation for regions in the plane. 
0 = {Re() &gt; 0} 
1 = {Re() &gt; 1}  {0} 
2 = {Re() &gt; 2}  {0, 1} 
 = {Re() &gt; }  {0, 1,  ,  + 1} 
So far we know that () is dened and analytic on 0. Our strategy is to use Property 3 to analyti-
cally continue  from 0 to . Along the way we will compute the residues at 0 and the negative 
integers. 
Rewrite Property 3 as 
( + 1) () = (3)  
The right side of this equation is analytic on 1. Since it agrees with () on 0 it represents an 
analytic continuation from 0 to 1. We easily compute 
Res( , 0) = lim () = (1) = 1. 
0 
( + 2) Similarly, Equation 3 can be expressed as ( + 1) = . So,  + 1 
( + 1) ( + 2) () = = (4)  ( + 1) 
The right side of this equation is analytic on 2. Since it agrees with  on 0 it is an analytic 
continuation to 2. The residue at 1 is 
(1) Res(, 1) = lim ( + 1)() = = 1 . 
1 1 
We can iterate this procedure as far as we want 
( +  + 1) () = (5) ( + )( +   1) +  + ( + 1)</text>

For complex numbers the triangle inequality translates to a statement about complex magnitudes.
Precisely: for complex numbers 1, 2 
1 + 2  1+ 2 
with equality only if one of them is 0 or if arg(1) = arg(2). This is illustrated in the following 
gure. 
 1+ 2 
2

Triangle inequality: 1 + 2  1+ 2 
We get equality only if 1 and 2 are on the same ray from the origin, i.e. they have the same 
argument. 
1.5 Polar coordinates 
In the gures above we have marked the length  and polar angle  of the vector from the origin to 
the point  =  + . These are the same polar coordinates you saw in 18.02 and 18.03. There are a
number of synonyms for both  and  
 =  = magnitude = length = norm = absolute value = modulus 
 = arg() = argument of  = polar angle of  
As in 18.02 you should be able to visualize polar coordinates by thinking about the distance  from 
the origin and the angle  with the -axis. 
Example 1.5. Lets make a table of ,  and  for some complex numbers. Notice that  is not 
uniquely dened since we can always add a multiple of 2 to  and still be at the same point in the 
plane. 
 =  +    
1 1 0, 2, 4,  Argument = 0, means  is along the -axis 
 1 2, 2 + 2  Argument = 2, means  is along the -axis 
1 +  2 4, 4 + 2  Argument = 4, means  is along the ray at 45 to the -axis

Note that  is real. We will use this property in the next example to help with division. 
Example 1.3. (Division.) Write 3 + 4 in the standard form  + . 1 + 2 
Solution: We use the useful property of conjugation to clear the denominator: 
3 + 4 3 + 4 1  2 11  2 11  2 =  = = . 1 + 2 1 + 2 1  2 5 5 5 
In the next section we will discuss the geometry of complex numbers, which gives some insight into
the meaning of the magnitude of a complex number. For now we just give the denition. 
Denition. The magnitude of the complex number  +  is dened as 
 
 = 2+ 2. 
The magnitude is also called the absolute value , norm or modulus. 
  
Example 1.4. The norm of 3 + 5 = 9 + 25 = 34. 
Important. The norm is the sum of 2 and 2. It does not include the  and is therefore always 
positive. 
1.4 The complex plane 
1.4.1 The geometry of complex numbers 
Because it takes two numbers  and  to describe the complex number  =  +  we can visualize 
complex numbers as points in the -plane. When we do this we call it the complex plane . Since  
is the real part of  we call the -axis the real axis. Likewise, the -axis is the imaginary axis . 
Imaginary axis 
 
  
 Imaginary axis

Real axis  Real axis

1.4.2 The triangle inequality 
The triangle inequality says that for a triangle the sum of the lengths of any two legs is greater than
the length of the third leg.

2. e1+2= e1e2 
3. (e) = e for positive integers . 
4. (e)1 = e 
5. e  0 
It will turn out that the property e 
= e also holds, but we cant prove this yet because we   havent dened what we mean by the complex derivative .  
Here are some more simple, but extremely important properties of e. You should become 
uent in their use and know how to prove them. 
6. e = 1 
Proof.  
e =  cos( ) +  sin( ) = cos2() + sin2()= 1. 
7. e+ = e (as usual  =  +  and ,  are real). 
Proof. You should be able to supply this. If not: ask a teacher or TA . 
8. The path e for 0 &lt;  &lt;  wraps counterclockwise around the unit circle. It does so innitely
many times. This is illustrated in the following picture.

1.11 Complex functions as mappings 
A complex function  =  () is hard to graph because it takes 4 dimensions: 2 for  and 2 for . So, 
to visualize them we will think of complex functions as mappings. That is we will think of  =  () 
as taking a point in the complex -plane and mapping (sending) it to a point in the complex -plane. 
We will use the following terms and symbols to discuss mappings. 
 A function  =  () will also be called a mapping of  to . 
 Alternatively we will write    or    (). This is read as  maps to . 
 We will say that  is the image of  under the mapping or more simply  is the image of

1 Complex algebra and the complex plane 
We will start with a review of the basic algebra and geometry of complex numbers. Most likely you
have encountered this previously in 18.03 or elsewhere. 
1.1 Motivation 
The equation 2 = 1 has no real solutions, yet we know that this equation arises naturally and we
want to use its roots. So we make up a new symbol for the roots and call it a complex number. 
Denition. The symbols  will stand for the solutions to the equation 2 = 1 . We will call these 
new numbers complex numbers . We will also write 
 
1 =  
Note: Engineers typically use  while mathematicians and physicists use . Well follow the mathe-
matical custom in 18.04. 
The number  is called an imaginary number. This is a historical term. These are perfectly valid 
numbers that dont happen to lie on the real number line.1 Were going to look at the algebra, 
geometry and, most important for us, the exponentiation of complex numbers. 
Before starting a systematic exposition of complex numbers, well work a simple example. 
Example 1.1. Solve the equation 2+  + 1 = 0. 
Solution: We can apply the quadratic formula to get 
     
1  1  4 1  3 1  31 1  3   = = = = . 2 2 2 2 
Think: Do you know how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square? This is how the
quadratic formula is derived and is well worth knowing! 
1.2 Fundamental theorem of algebra 
One of the reasons for using complex numbers is because allowing complex roots means every 
polynomial has exactly the expected number of roots. This is called the fundamental theorem of 
algebra. 
Theorem. (Fundamental theorem of algebra) A polynomial of degree  has exactly  complex 
roots (repeated roots are counted with multiplicity). 
1Our motivation for using complex numbers is not the same as the historical motivation. Historically, mathematicians 
were willing to say 2 = 1 had no solutions. The issue that pushed them to accept complex numbers had to do with
the formula for the roots of cubics. Cubics always have at least one real root, and when square roots of negative numbers
appeared in this formula, even for the real roots, mathematicians were forced to take a closer look at these (seemingly)
exotic objects.

When we want to be clear which value of  is meant, we will specify a branch of arg. For example, 
0   &lt; 2 or  &lt;   . This will be discussed in much more detail in the coming weeks. 
Keeping careful track of the branches of arg will turn out to be one of the key requirements of 
complex analysis. 
1.6 Eulers Formula 
Eulers (pronounced oilers) formula connects complex exponentials, polar coordinates, and sines
and cosines. It turns messy trig identities into tidy rules for exponentials. We will use it a lot. The
formula is the following: 
e = cos() +  sin( ). (1) 
There are many ways to approach Eulers formula. Our approach is to simply take Equation 1 as
the denition of complex exponentials. This is legal, but does not show that its a good denition.
To do that we need to show the e obeys all the rules we expect of an exponential. To do that 
we go systematically through the properties of exponentials and check that they hold for complex
exponentials. 
1.6.1 e behaves like a true exponential 
P1. e dierentiates as expected: 
e 
= e .  
Proof. This follows directly from the denition: 
e 
=  (cos() +  sin()) =  sin() +  cos() = (cos() +  sin()) = e.   
P2. e0= 1. 
Proof. e0 = cos(0) +  sin(0) = 1. 
P3. The usual rules of exponents hold: 
ee = e(+). 
Proof. This relies on the cosine and sine addition formulas. 
e  e = (cos() +  sin())  (cos() +  sin()) 
= cos() cos()  sin() sin() +  (cos() sin() + sin() cos()) 
= cos( + ) +  sin( + ) = e(+). 
P4. The denition of e is consistent with the power series for e. 
Proof. To see this we have to recall the power series for e, cos() and sin(). They are 
e 2 3 4 
= 1 +  + + + +  2! 3! 4!

1.9 Representing complex multiplication as matrix multiplication 
Consider two complex numbers 1=  +  and 2=  +  and their product 
12= ( + )( + ) = (  ) + ( + ) =  (3) 
Now lets dene two matrices 
[ ] [ ]     1= 2=     
Note that these matrices store the same information as 1 and 2, respectively. Lets compute their 
matrix product 
[ ][ ] [ ]        ( + ) 12= = =  .      +     
Comparing  just above with  in Equation 3, we see that  is indeed the matrix corresponding 
to the complex number  = 12. Thus, we can represent any complex number  equivalently by 
the matrix [ ] Re   Im   = Im  Re  
and complex multiplication then simply becomes matrix multiplication. Further note that we can 
write [ ] [ ] 1 0 0 1  = Re  + Im  , 0 1 1 0 
[ ] 0 1 i.e., the imaginary unit  corresponds to the matrix 1 0 and 2 = 1 becomes 
[ ][ ] [ ] 0 1 0 1 1 0 =  . 1 0 1 0 0 1 
Polar form (decomposition). Writing  = e = (cos  +  sin ), we nd 
[ ] [ ][ ] cos   sin   0 cos   sin   =  = sin  cos  0  sin  cos  
corresponding to a stretch factor  multiplied by a 2D rotation matrix. In particular, multiplication 
by  corresponds to the rotation with angle  = 2 and  = 1. 
We will not make a lot of use of the matrix representation of complex numbers, but later it will help
us remember certain formulas and facts. 
1.10 The exponential function 
We have Eulers formula: e = cos() +  sin( ). We can extend this to the complex exponential 
function e. 
Denition. For  =  +  the complex exponential function is dened as 
e = e+ = ee = e(cos() +  sin()). 
In this denition e is the usual exponential function for a real variable . 
It is easy to see that all the usual rules of exponents hold:</text>

For example, under the mapping    the image of the imaginary -axis is the real -axis.

The image of the imaginary axis under   . 
Next, well illustrate visualizing mappings with some examples: 
Example 1.14. The mapping  = 2. We visualize this by putting the -plane on the left and the 
-plane on the right. We then draw various curves and regions in the -plane and the corresponding 
image under 2 in the -plane. 
In the rst gure we show that rays from the origin are mapped by 2 to rays from the origin. We 
see that 
1. The ray 2 at 4 radians is mapped to the ray  (2) at  2 radians. 
2. The rays 2 and 6 are both mapped to the same ray. This is true for each pair of diametrically 
opposed rays. 
3. A ray at angle  is mapped to the ray at angle 2 .

1.6.5 The geometry of th roots 
Looking at the examples above we see that roots are always spaced evenly around a circle centered
at the origin. For example, the fth roots of 1 +  are spaced at increments of 25 radians around 
the circle of radius 215. 
Note also that the roots of real numbers always come in conjugate pairs.

1.7 Inverse Euler formula 
Eulers formula gives a complex exponential in terms of sines and cosines. We can turn this around
to get the inverse Euler formulas. 
Eulers formula says: 
e  = cos() +  sin() and e = cos()   sin(). 
By adding and subtracting we get: 
e + e e  e 
cos() = and sin() = . 2 2 
Please take note of these formulas we will use them frequently! 
1.8 de Moivres formula 
For positive integers  we have de Moivres formula: 
(cos( ) +  sin( )) = cos() +  sin( ) 
Proof. This is a simple consequence of Eulers formula: 
= (e) = e (cos( ) +  sin( )) = cos() +  sin( ). 
The reason this simple fact has a name is that historically de Moivre stated it before Eulers formula
was known. Without Eulers formula there is not such a simple proof.</text>

a jump by 2 when  crosses the branch cut. 
1.12.3 The principal branch of arg() 
Branch (ii) in the previous section is singled out and given a name: 
Denition. The branch  &lt; arg()   is called the principal branch of arg(). We will use the 
notation Arg() (capital A) to indicate that we are using the principal branch. (Of course, in cases
where we dont want there to be any doubt we will say explicitly that we are using the principal
branch.) 
1.12.4 Continuity of arg() 
The examples above show that there is no getting around the jump of 2 as we cross the branch cut. 
This means that when we need arg() to be continuous we will have to restrict its domain to the plane 
minus a branch cut. 
1.13 Concise summary of branches and branch cuts 
We discussed branches and branch cuts for arg(). Before talking about log() and its branches and 
branch cuts we will give a short review of what these terms mean. You should probably scan this 
section now and then come back to it after reading about log(). 
Consider the function  =  (). Suppose that  =  +  and  =  + . 
Domain. The domain of  is the set of  where we are allowed to compute  (). 
Range. The range (image) of  is the set of all  () for  in the domain, i.e. the set of all  reached 
by  . 
Branch. For a multiple-valued function, a branch is a choice of range for the function. We choose
the range to exclude all but one possible value for each element of the domain. 
Branch cut. A branch cut removes (cuts) points out of the domain. This is done to remove points
where the function is discontinuous. 
1.14 The function log() 
Our goal in this section is to dene the log function. We want log() to be the inverse of e. That 
is, we want elog()= . We will see that log() is multiple-valued, so when we use it we will have to 
specify a branch. 
We start by looking at the simplest example which illustrates that log() is multiple-valued. 
Example 1.18. Find log(1). 
Solution: We know that e0 = 1, so log(1) = 0 is one answer. 
We also know that e2 = 1, so log(1) = 2 is another possible answer. In fact, we can choose any 
multiple of 2: 
log(1) = 2, where  is any integer</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>20</slideno>
          <text>1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE 21 
This example leads us to consider the polar form for  as we try to dene log(). If  = e then 
one possible value for log() is 
log() = log(e) = log() + , 
here log() is the usual logarithm of a real positive number. For completeness we show explicitly 
that with this denition elog()= : 
log() log()+ log()e = e e = e = e = . 
Since  =  and  = arg() we have arrived at our denition. 
Denition. The function log() is dened as 
log() = log() +  arg(), 
where log() is the usual natural logarithm of a positive real number. 
Remarks. 
1. Since arg( ) has innitely many possible values, so does log(). 
2. log(0) is not dened. (Both because arg(0) is not dened and log(0) is not dened.) 
3. Choosing a branch for arg() makes log() single valued. The usual terminology is to say we 
have chosen a branch of the log function. 
4. The principal branch of log comes from the principal branch of arg. That is, 
log() = log() +  arg(), where   &lt; arg()   (principal branch) . 
Example 1.19. Compute all the values of log(). Specify which one comes from the principal 
branch. 
 Solution: We have that  = 1 and arg() = + 2 , so 2 
  log() = log(1) +  2+ 2 =  2+ 2, where  is any integer. 
The principal branch of arg() is between  and , so Arg() = 2. Therefore, the value of log() 
from the principal branch is 2. 
 
Example 1.20. Compute all the values of log(1  3 ). Specify which one comes from the 
principal branch. 
 
Solution: Let  = 1  3 . Then  = 2 and in the principal branch Arg() = 23. So all the 
values of log() are 
2 log() = log(2)   + 2. 3 
The value from the principal branch is log() = log(2)  23.</text>

          <text>1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE 24 
This gives only three distinct values 
e6, e56, e96 
 On the principal branch log() =  , so the value of 13 which comes from this is 2 
 
e6 3  = +2. 2 
Example 1.23. Compute all the values of 1. What is the value from the principal branch? 
Solution: This is similar to the problems above. log(1) = 2, so 
1 = e log(1) = e2 2 = e , where  is an integer. 
The principal branch has log(1) = 0 so 1 = 1.</text>

Now we can write the power series for e and then split it into the power series for sine and cosine: 
 
e  () 
= ! 0 
 2  2+1   
= (1) +  (1) 
0 (2)! 0(2 + 1)! 
= cos() +  sin( ). 
So the Euler formula denition is consistent with the usual power series for e. 
Properties P1-P4 should convince you that e behaves like an exponential. 
1.6.2 Complex exponentials and polar form 
Now lets turn to the relation between polar coordinates and complex exponentials. 
Suppose  =  +  has polar coordinates  and . That is, we have  =  cos( ) and  =  sin( ). 
Thus, we get the important relationship 
 =  +  =  cos( ) +  sin( ) = (cos( ) +  sin( )) = e. 
This is so important you shouldnt proceed without understanding. We also record it without the 
intermediate equation. 
 =  +  = e. (2) 
Because  and  are the polar coordinates of (, ) we call  = e the polar form of . 
Lets now verify that magnitude, argument, conjugate, multiplication and division are easy in polar
form. 
Magnitude. e = 1. 
Proof.  
e =  cos( ) +  sin( ) = cos2() + sin2()= 1. 
In words, this says that e is always on the unit circle  this is useful to remember! 
Likewise, if  = e then  = . You can calculate this, but it should be clear from the denitions: 
 is the distance from  to the origin, which is exactly the same denition as for . 
Argument. If  = e then arg() = . 
Proof. This is again the denition: the argument is the polar angle . 
Conjugate. (e)= e. 
Proof. 
 (e)= (cos( ) +  sin( )) = (cos( )   sin( )) = (cos( ) +  sin( )) = e . 
In words: complex conjugation changes the sign of the argument. 
= 1e1 and 2 Multiplication. If 1 = 2e2 then 
12= 12e(1+2).</text>

so cos(2) = Re(e2). The complex replacement trick is to replace cos(2) by e2. We get (justi-
cation below) 
 =  e cos 2 + e sin 2 ,  = Re(). 
Computing  is straightforward: 
e(1+2) 
 =  ee2  =  e(1+2)  = . 1 + 2 
Here we will do the computation rst in rectangular coordinates . In applications, for example
throughout 18.03, polar form is often preferred because it is easier and gives the answer in a more
useable form. 
e(1+2) 1  2  =  1 + 2 1  2 
e(cos(2) +  sin(2))(1  2) = 5 
1 = e(cos(2) + 2 sin(2) + (2 cos(2 ) + sin(2))) 5 
So, 
1  = Re() = e(cos(2) + 2 sin(2)). 5 
Justication of complex replacement. The trick comes by cleverly adding a new integral to  as 
follows. Let  =  e sin(2) . Then we let 
 =  +  =  e(cos(2) +  sin(2))  =  ee2 . 
Clearly, by construction, Re( ) =  as claimed above. 
Alternative using polar coordinates to simplify the expression for  :  
In polar form, we have 1 + 2 = e, where  = 5 and  = arg(1 + 2) = tan1(2) in the rst 
quadrant. Then: 
e(1+2)e e 
e(2)  =  =  =  (cos(2  ) +  sin(2  )). 
5e 5 5 
Thus, 
e 
 = Re() =  cos(2  ).

1.6.4 th roots 
We are going to need to be able to nd the th roots of complex numbers, i.e., solve equations of the 
form 
 = , 
where  is a given complex number. This can be done most conveniently by expressing  and  in 
polar form,  = e and  = e. Then, upon substituting, we have to solve 
 e = e</text>

In a few weeks, we will be able to prove this theorem as a remarkably simple consequence of one of
our main theorems. 
1.3 Terminology and basic arithmetic 
Denitions 
 Complex numbers are dened as the set of all numbers 
 =  + , 
where  and  are real numbers. 
 We denote the set of all complex numbers by . (On the blackboard we will usually write  
this font is called blackboard bold. ) 
 We call  the real part of . This is denoted by  = Re(). 
 We call  the imaginary part of . This is denoted by  = Im(). 
Important: The imaginary part of  is a real number. It does not include the . 
The basic arithmetic operations follow the standard rules. All you have to remember is that 2 = 1 . 
We will go through these quickly using some simple examples. It almost goes without saying that
in 18.04 it is essential that you become uent with these manipulations. 
 Addition: (3 + 4) + (7 + 11) = 10 + 15  
 Subtraction: (3 + 4)  (7 + 11) = 4  7  
 Multiplication: 
(3 + 4)(7 + 11) = 21 + 28  + 33 + 442 = 23 + 61. 
Here we have used the fact that 442 = 44. 
Before talking about division and absolute value we introduce a new operation called conjugation.
It will prove useful to have a name and symbol for this, since we will use it frequently. 
Complex conjugation is denoted with a bar and dened by 
 +  =   . 
If  =  +  then its conjugate is  =    and we read this as z-bar =   . 
Example 1.2. 
3 + 5 = 3  5. 
The following is a very useful property of conjugation : If  =  +  then 
 = ( + )(  ) = 2+ 2 .</text>

This is what mathematicians call trivial to see, just write the multiplication down. In words, the 
formula says the for 12 the magnitudes multiply and the arguments add. 
Division. Again its trivial that 
1e1 1 e(12) = . 2e2 2 
Example 1.6. (Multiplication by 2) Heres a simple but important example. By looking at the graph 
we see that the number 2 has magnitude 2 and argument 2. So in polar coordinates it equals 2e2. 
This means that multiplication by 2 multiplies lengths by 2 and adds 2 to arguments, i.e. rotates 
by 90. The eect is shown in the gures below 
ReIm
2i= 2ei/2
/2
ReIm
ReIm 2i
2 = 2, arg(2) = 2 Multiplication by 2 rotates by 2 and scales by 2 
( )3 
1+ 3 Example 1.7. (Raising to a power) Lets compute (1 + )6 and 2 
  
2e4 Solution: 1 +  has magnitude = 2 and arg = 4, so 1 +  = . Raising to a power is now 
easy: ( )6 
2e4 = 8e64 = 8e32 (1 + )6= = 8 . 
 ( )3 
Similarly, 1 +  3 = e3, so 1 +  3 = (1  e3)3 = e = 1 2 2 
1.6.3 Complexication or complex replacement 
In the next example we will illustrate the technique of complexication or complex replacement. This 
can be used to simplify a trigonometric integral. It will come in handy when we need to compute
certain integrals. 
Example 1.8. Use complex replacement to compute 
 =  e cos(2) . 
Solution: We have Eulers formula 
2 e = cos(2 ) +  sin(2),</text>

For the complex numbers on the left and right to be equal, their magnitudes must be the same and
their arguments can only dier by an integer multiple of 2. This gives 
 = 1  =  + 2, where  = 0, 1, 2,  
Solving for , we have 
 2  = + .   
Example 1.9. Find all 5 fth roots of 2. 
Solution: For  = 2, we have  = 2 and  = 0, so the fth roots of 2 are 
= 215 25  e , where  = 0, 1, 2,  
Looking at the right hand side we see that for  = 5 we have 215e2 which is exactly the same as 
the root when  = 0, i.e. 215e0. Likewise  = 6 gives exactly the same root as  = 1, and so on. 
This means, we have 5 dierent roots corresponding to  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 
= 215, 215e25, 215e45, 215e65, 215e85  
Similarly we can say that in general  = e has  distinct  th roots: 
= 1 e + 2( ) for  = 0, 1, 2,    1.  
Example 1.10. Find the 4 fourth roots of 1. 
Solution: We need to solve 4= 1, so  = 0. So the 4 distinct fourth roots are in polar form 
= 1, e2, e, e32  
and in Cartesian representation 
 = 1, , 1, . 
Example 1.11. Find the 3 cube roots of -1. 
e + 2 , e, e53 Solution: 2 = 1 = . So,  = e 3+ 2(3) and the 3 cube roots are e3 . 
Since  3 radians is 60 we can simpify: 
  
1 3 1 3 e3 = cos(3) +  sin( 3) = +    = 1,   2 2 2 2 
Example 1.12. Find the 5 fth roots of 1 + . 
 
Solution: 5 = 1 +  = 2e(4+2 ), for  = 0, 1, 2, . So, the 5 fth roots are 
2110e20, 2110e920, 2110e17 20, 2110e25 20, 2110e33 20. 
Using a calculator we could write these numerically as  + , but there is no easy simplication. 
Example 1.13. We should check that our technique works as expected for a simple problem. Find
the 2 square roots of 4. 
= 4e 2 = 2 and 2e Solution: 2 . So,  = 2e , with  = 0, 1. So the two roots are 2e0 = 2 
as expected!</text>

1.12.2 Branches of arg() 
Important note. You should master this section. Branches of arg() are the key that really underlies 
all our other examples. Fortunately it is reasonably straightforward. 
The key point is that the argument is only dened up to multiples of 2 so every  produces innitely 
many values for arg(). Because of this we will say that arg( ) is a multiple-valued function . 
Note. In general a function should take just one value. What that means in practice is that whenever
we use such a function will have to be careful to specify which of the possible values we mean. This
is known as specifying a branch of the function. 
Denition. By a branch of the argument function we mean a choice of range so that it becomes 
single-valued. By specifying a branch we are saying that we will take the single value of arg() that 
lies in the branch. 
Lets look at several dierent branches to understand how they work: 
(i) If we specify the branch as 0  arg() &lt; 2 then we have the following arguments. 
arg(1) = 0; arg() = 2; arg(1) = ; arg( ) = 3 2 
This branch and these points are shown graphically in Figure (i) below. 
Figure (i): The branch 0  arg() &lt; 2 of arg( ). 
Notice that if we start at  = 1 on the positive real axis we have arg() = 0. Then arg() increases 
as we move counterclockwise around the circle. The argument is continuous until we get back to the
positive real axis. There it jumps from almost 2 back to 0. 
There is no getting around (no pun intended) this discontinuity. If we need arg() to be continuous 
we will need to remove (cut) the points of discontinuity out of the domain. The branch cut for this 
branch of arg() is shown as a thick orange line in the gure. If we make the branch cut then the 
domain for arg( ) is the plane minus the cut, i.e. we will only consider arg() for  not on the cut. 
For future reference you should note that, on this branch, arg() is continuous near the negative real 
axis, i.e. the arguments of nearby points are close to each other. 
(ii) If we specify the branch as  &lt; arg()   then we have the following arguments: 
arg(1) = 0; arg() = 2; arg(1) = ; arg( ) =  2</text>

This branch and these points are shown graphically in Figure (ii) below. 
Figure (ii): The branch  &lt; arg()   of arg(). 
Compare Figure (ii) with Figure (i). The values of arg() are the same in the upper half plane, but 
in the lower half plane they dier by 2. 
For this branch the branch cut is along the negative real axis. As we cross the branch cut the value
of arg( ) jumps from  to something close to . 
(iii) Figure (iii) shows the branch of arg() with  4  arg() &lt; 94. 
Figure (iii): The branch 4  arg() &lt; 94 of arg( ). 
Notice that on this branch arg() is continuous at both the positive and negative real axes. The jump 
of 2 occurs along the ray at angle 4. 
(iv) Obviously, there are many many possible branches. For example, 
42 &lt; arg()  42 + 2. 
(v) We wont make use of this in 18.04, but, in fact, the branch cut doesnt have to be a straight line.
Any curve that goes from the origin to innity will do. The argument will be continuous except for</text>

By the triangle inequality for integrals, if  &gt; 1 
 1  ()   e . (5) (2e2 + 1)2   0   
From the triangle equality in the form Equation 4b we know that 
2e2 + 1  2e2  1 = 2 1. 
Thus, 
1 1 1 1    2e2 + 1 2e2 + 12 2 1 (2  1)2 . 
Using Equation 5, we then have

  ()  
 0 (2e2 + 1)2   0(2  1)2  =(2  1)2 
Clearly this goes to 0 as  goes to innity. Thus, the integral over the contour 1+  goes to  as 
 gets large. But 
 ()  = 2 1+ 
for all  &gt; 1. We can therefore conclude that  = 2. 
As a sanity check, we note that our answer is real and positive as it needs to be. 
4.4 Proof of Cauchys integral formula 
4.4.1 A useful theorem 
Before proving the theorem well need a theorem that will be useful in its own right. 
Theorem 4.14. (A second extension of Cauchys theorem) Suppose that  is a simply connected 
region containing the point 0. Suppose  is a function which is 
1. Analytic on   {0} 
2. Continuous on . (In particular,  does not blow up at 0.) 
Then, 
()  = 0  
for all closed curves  in . 
Proof. The extended version of Cauchys theorem in the Topic 3 notes tells us that 
()  =  () ,  
where  is a circle of radius  around 0.</text>

4 Cauchys integral formula 
4.1 Introduction 
Cauchys theorem is a big theorem which we will use almost daily from here on out. Right away it
will reveal a number of interesting and useful properties of analytic functions. More will follow as
the course progresses. 
If you learn just one theorem this week it should be Cauchys integral formula! 
We start with a statement of the theorem for functions. After some examples, well give a gener -
alization to all derivatives of a function. After some more examples we will prove the theorems.
After that we will see some remarkable consequences that follow fairly directly from the Cauchys
formula. 
4.2 Cauchys integral for functions 
Theorem 4.1. (Cauchys integral formula) Suppose  is a simple closed curve and the function  () 
is analytic on a region containing  and its interior. We assume  is oriented counterclockwise. Then 
for any 0 inside  :

Cauchys integral formula: simple closed curve  ,  () analytic on and inside . 
This is remarkable: it says that knowing the values of  on the boundary curve  means we know 
everything about  inside !! This is probably unlike anything youve encountered with functions 
of real variables. 
Aside 1. With a slight change of notation ( becomes  and 0 becomes ) we often write the 
formula as 
1  ()  () =  (2) 2     
Aside 2. Were not being entirely fair to functions of real variables. We will see that for  =  +

has exactly  roots. 
Proof. There are two parts to the proof. 
Hard part: Show that  has at least one root. 
This is done by contradiction, together with Liouvilles theorem. Suppose  () does not have a 
zero. Then 
1.  () = 1 () is entire. This is obvious because (by assumption)  () has no zeros. 
2.  () is bounded. This follows because 1 () goes to 0 as  goes to . 
Im(z )Im(z )
RCR
M= max of |
1/P(z)|in here.|1/P (z)|small out
here.
(It is clear that 1 () goes to 0 as  goes to innity, i.e. 1 () is small outside a large circle. 
So 1 () is bounded by  .) 
So, by Liouvilles theorem  () is constant, and therefore  () must be constant as well. But this is 
a contradiction, so the hypothesis of No zeros must be wrong, i.e.  must have a zero. 
Easy part:  has exactly  zeros. Let 0 be one zero. We can factor  () = (  0)(). () has 
degree   1. If   1 &gt; 0, then we can apply the result to (). We can continue this process until 
the degree of  is 0. 
4.6.4 Maximum modulus principle 
Briey, the maximum modulus principle states that if  is analytic and not constant in a domain  
then  () has no relative maximum in  and the absolute maximum of   occurs on the boundary 
of . 
In order to prove the maximum modulus principle we will rst prove the mean value property. This 
will give you a good feel for the maximum modulus principle. It is also important and interesting in
its own right. 
Theorem 4.17. (Mean value property) Suppose  () is analytic on the closed disk of radius  cen-
tered at 0, i.e. the set   0  . Then,

Here we have used that  
 ()  =( )2 + ( )2  = , 
the arclength element.  
Example 4.13. Compute the real integral 
 1   =  (2 + 1)2 
Solution: The trick is to integrate  () = 1(2 + 1)2 over the closed contour 1 +  shown, and 
then show that the contribution of  to this integral vanishes as  goes to .

The only singularity of

inside the contour is at  = . Let 1 () = ( + )2 . 
Since  is analytic on and inside the contour, Cauchys formula gives 
() 2   ()  = 1+  = 2 () = 2  = 2 . 1+ (  )2 (2)3 
We parametrize 1 by 
() = , with      . 
So, 
 ()  =   1 . 1  (2 + 1)2 
This goes to  (the value we want to compute) as   . 
Next, we parametrize  by 
() = e, with 0    . 
So,  1  ()  =  e   0(2e2 + 1)2</text>

4.6 Amazing consequence of Cauchys integral formula 
4.6.1 Existence of derivatives 
Theorem. Suppose  () is analytic on a region . Then,  has derivatives of all order. 
Proof. This follows from Cauchys integral formula for derivatives. That is, we have a formula for 
all the derivatives, so in particular the derivatives all exist. 
A little more precisely: for any point  in  we can put a small disk around 0 that is entirely 
contained in . Let  be the boundary of the disk, then Cauchys formula gives a formula for all the 
derivatives  ()(0) in terms of integrals over . In particular, those derivatives exist.  
Remark. If you look at the proof of Cauchys formula for derivatives youll see that  having 
derivatives of all orders boils down to 1(  ) having derivatives of all orders for  on a curve 
not containing . 
Important remark. We have at times assumed that for  =  +  analytic,  and  have continuous 
higher order partial derivatives. This theorem conrms that fact. In particular,  = , etc. 
4.6.2 Cauchys inequality 
Theorem 4.15. (Cauchys inequality) Let  be the circle 0 = . Assume that  () is analytic 
on  and its interior, i.e. on the disk   0  . Finally let  = max  () over  on . 
Then 
 ()(0)  ! ,  = 1, 2, 3,  (6)  
Proof. Using Cauchys integral formula for derivatives (Equation 3) we have 
 ()  !   ()(0)  !   !  =  2   0+1 2 2 +1 2  +1  
4.6.3 Liouvilles theorem 
Theorem 4.16. (Liouvilles theorem) Assume  () is entire and suppose it is bounded in the complex 
plane, namely  () &lt;  for all    then  () is constant. 
Proof. For any circle of radius  around 0 the Cauchy inequality says  (0)   . But,  can  
be as large as we like so we conclude that  (0) = 0 for every 0 . Since the derivative is 0, 
the function itself is constant. 
In short: 
If  is entire and bounded then  is constant. 
Note.  () =  +  + 0, sin(), e are all entire but not bounded. 
Now, practically for free, we get the fundamental theorem of algebra.

Since () is continuous we know that () is bounded inside . Say, () &lt; . The corollary 
to the triangle inequality says that 
()    (length of ) =  2. 
  
Since  can be as small as we want, this implies that 
()  = 0.  
Note. Using this, we can show that () is, in fact, analytic at 0. The proof will be the same as in 
our proof of Cauchys theorem that () has an antiderivative.

Proof. This is an application of Cauchys integral formula on the disk 
Re(z )Im(z )
z0r Cr  =   0  . 
We can parametrize , the boundary of , as 
() = 0+ e, with 0    2, so  () = e. 
By Cauchys formula we have 
2  (0+ e)2 1  () 1 1  (0) =  = e  =  (0+ e)  e 2    0 2  2 0 0 
This proves the property.  
In words, the mean value property says  (0) is the arithmetic mean of the values on the circle. 
Now we can state and prove the maximum modulus principle. We state the assumptions carefully.
When applying this theorem, it is important to verify that the assumptions are satised. 
Theorem 4.18. (Maximum modulus principle) Suppose  () is analytic in a connected region  
and 0 is a point in . 
1. If   has a relative maximum at 0 then  () is constant in a neighborhood of 0. 
2. If  is bounded and connected, and  is continuous on  and its boundary, then either  is 
constant or the absolute maximum of   occurs only on the boundary of . 
Proof. Part (1): The argument for part (1) is a little fussy. We will use the mean value property and 
the triangle inequality from Theorem 4.11. 
Since 0 is a relative maximum of  , for every small enough circle     0 =  around 0 we 
have  ()   (0) for  on . Therefore, by the mean value property and the triangle inequality 
2 
 (0) =  1  (mean value property)  (0+ e)  2  0 
2   
1   (0+ e)  (triangle inequality) 2 0 
2 
 1  (0)  ( (0+ e)   (0)) 2 0 
=  (0)
Since the beginning and end of the above are both  (0) all the inequalities in the chain must be 
equalities.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>14</slideno>
          <text>4 CAUCHYS INTEGRAL FORMULA 15 
The rst inequality can only be an equality if for all ,  (0+ e) lie on the same ray from the 
origin, i.e. have the same argument or are 0. 
The second inequality can only be an equality if all  (0+ e) =  (0). So we have all  (0+ 
e) have the same magnitude and the same argumeny. This implies they are all the same. 
Finally, if  () is constant along the circle and  (0) is the average of  () over the circle then 
 () =  (0), i.e.  is constant on a small disk around 0. 
Part (2): The assumptions that  is bounded and  is continuous on  and its boundary serve to 
guarantee that   has an absolute maximum (on  combined with its boundary). Part (1) guarantees
that the absolute maximum can not lie in the interior of the region  unless  is constant. (This
requires a bit more argument. Do you see why?) If the absolute maximum is not in the interior it
must be on the boundary.  
Example 4.19. Find the maximum modulus of e on the unit square with 0  ,   1. 
Solution: 
e+ = e , 
so the maximum is when  = 1, 0    1 is arbitrary. This is indeed on the boundary of the unit 
square 
Example 4.20. Find the maximum modulus for sin() on the square [0, 2]  [0, 2]. 
Solution: We use the formula 
sin() = sin  cosh  +  cos  sinh . 
So, 
 sin()2 = sin2  cosh2  + cos2  sinh2  
= sin2  cosh2  + (1  sin2 ) sinh2  
= sin2  + sinh2 . 
We know the maximum over  of sin2() is at  = 2 and  = 3 2. The maximum of sinh2  is 
at  = 2. So maximum modulus is 
  
1 + sinh2(2) = cosh2(2) = cosh(2 ). 
This occurs at the points 
 3  =  +  = 2 + 2, and  = 2 + 2. 
Both these points are on the boundary of the region. 
Example 4.21. Suppose  () is entire. Show that if lim  () = 0 then  ()  0. 
 
Solution: This is a standard use of the maximum modulus principle. The strategy is to show that
the maximum of  () is not on the boundary (of the appropriately chosen region), so  () must be 
constant. Fix 
0. For  &gt; 0 let  be the maximum of  () on the circle  = . The maximum 
modulus theorem says that  (0) &lt; . Since  () goes to 0, as  goes to innity, we must have 
 also goes to 0. This means  (0) = 0. Since this is true for any 0, we have  ()  0.</text>

          <text>4 CAUCHYS INTEGRAL FORMULA 16 
Example 4.22. Here is an example of why you need  to be bounded in the maximum modulus 
theorem. Let  be the upper half-plane 
Im() &gt; 0. 
So the boundary of  is the real axis. 
Let  () = e. We have 
 () = e = 1 
for  along the real axis. Since  (2) = e2 &gt; 1, we see   cannot take its maximum along the 
boundary of . 
Of course, it cant take its maximum in the interior of  either. What happens here is that  () 
doesnt have a maximum modulus. Indeed  () goes to innity along the positive imaginary axis.</text>

That is, if we dene (0) =  (0) then  is continuous at 0. From the extension of Cauchys 
theorem just above, we have 
 ()   (0) ()  = 0, i.e.  = 0.     0 
Thus 
 ()  (0) 1  =   =  (0)   = 2 (0).    0   0   0 
The last equality follows from our, by now, well known integral of 1(  0) on a loop around 0. 
4.5 Proof of Cauchys integral formula for derivatives 
Recall that Cauchys integral formula in Equation 3 says 
!  ()  ()() = ,  = 0, 1, 2,  2  (  )+1 
First well oer a quick proof which captures the reason behind the formula, and then a formal proof. 
Quick proof: We have an integral representation for  (),   , we use that to nd an integral 
representation for  (),   . 
[ ] ( ) 
 1  () 1   () 1  ()  () =  =  =   2     2      2  (  )2 
(Note, since    and   , we know that     0) Thus, 
1  ()  () =  2  (  )2 
Now, by iterating this process, i.e. by mathematical induction, we can show the formula for higher
order derivatives. 
Formal proof: We do this by taking the limit of 
 ( + )   () lim 
0  
using the integral representation of both terms: 
1  () 1  ()  ( + ) = ,  () =  2       2     
Now, using a little algebraic manipulation we get 
 ( + )   () 1  ()  () =    2           
1  () =  2   (    )(  ) 
1  () =  2  (  )2  (  ) 
Letting  go to 0, we get Cauchys formula for  (): 
 ()  () = 1  2  (  )2 
There is no problem taking the limit under the integral sign because everything is continuous and
the denominator is never 0.</text>

4.3.3 The triangle inequality for integrals 
We discussed the triangle inequality in the Topic 1 notes. It says that 

1+ 2  1 + 2, (4a) 
with equality if and only if 1 and 2 lie on the same ray from the origin. 
A useful variant of this statement is 
1  2  1 2. (4b) 
This follows because Equation 4a implies 
1 = (1 2) + 2  1 2 + 2. 
Now subtracting 2 from both sides give Equation 4b 
Since an integral is basically a sum, this translates to the triangle inequality for integrals. Well state
it in two ways that will be useful to us. 
Theorem 4.11. (Triangle inequality for integrals) Suppose () is a complex valued function of a 
real variable, dened on     . Then 
  
 ()  
  ()) ,   
with equality if and only if the values of () all lie on the same ray from the origin. 
Proof. This follows by approximating the integral as a Riemann sum. 
   
  

 ()    (
)()   () . 
The middle inequality is just the standard triangle inequality for sums of complex numbers.  
Theorem 4.12. (Triangle inequality for integrals II) For any function  () and any curve , we have 
  ()   (). 
   
Here  =  ()  and   =  () . 
Proof. This follows immediately from the previous theorem: 
    ()  =   (()) ()    (()) ()  =   (). 
     
Corollary. If  () &lt;  on  then 
 ()     (length of  ). 
  
Proof. Let (), with     , be a parametrization of  . Using the triangle inequality 
  
  ()  
   () =   (())  ()    ()  =   (length of ).</text>

Split the original curve  into 2 pieces that each surround just one singularity. 
We have   = 2+ 4 (  2)( + 2). 
We let   1() = and 2() = .  + 2   2 
So, 
 1() 2() = = . 2+ 4   2  + 2 
The integral, can be written out as 
  1() 2()  = 1+33+2  = 1+3  + 23  2+ 4 2+ 4   2  + 2  
Since 1 is analytic inside the simple closed curve 1+3 and 2 is analytic inside the simple closed 
curve 2 3, Cauchys formula applies to both integrals. The total integral equals 
2(1(2) + 2(2)) = 2(12 + 12) = 2. 
Remarks. 1. We could also have done this problem using partial fractions: 
   = + . (  2)( + 2)   2  + 2 
It will turn out that  = 1(2) and  = 2(2). It is easy to apply the Cauchy integral formula to 
both terms. 
2. Important note. In an upcoming topic we will formulate the Cauchy residue theorem. This will
allow us to compute the integrals in Examples 4.8-4.10 in an easier and less ad hoc manner.</text>

4.3.1 Another approach to some basic examples 
Suppose  is a simple closed curve around 0. We have seen that 
1  = 2.   
The Cauchy integral formula gives the same result. That is, let  () = 1 , then the formula says 
1  ()  =  (0) = 1. 2    0 
Likewise Cauchys formula for derivatives shows 
1  ()  =   =  ()(0) = 0, for integers  &gt; 1.  () +1

Solution: Let  () = cos()(2 + 8).  () is analytic on and inside the curve . That is, the roots

So, its easy to compute

Again its trivial to check that    = 0, so they are orthogonal.

 () = 2 . 
From the previous example we have 
(, ) = 2 2 , (, ) = 2 ,  = (2, 2),  = (2, 2). 
At  = 0, the gradients are both 0 so the theorem on orthogonality doesnt apply. 
Lets look at the level curves through the origin. The level curve (really the level set) for 
 = 2 2= 0 
is the pair of lines  = . At the origin this is not a smooth curve. 
Look at the gures for 2 above. It does appear that away from the origin the level curves of  
intersect the lines where  = 0 at right angles. The same is true for the level curves of  and the lines 
where  = 0. You can see the degeneracy forming at the origin: as the level curves head towards 0 
they get pointier and more right angled. So the level curve  = 0 is more properly thought of as four 
right angles. The level curve of  = 0, not knowing which leg of  = 0 to intersect orthogonally 
takes the average and comes into the origin at 45.</text>

5.6 Orthogonality of curves 
An important property of harmonic conjugates  and  is that their level curves are orthogonal. We 
start by showing their gradients are orthogonal. 
Lemma 5.4. Let  =  +  and suppose that  () = (, ) + (, ) is analytic. Then the dot 
product of their gradients is 0, i.e. 
   = 0. 
Proof. The proof is an easy application of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 
   = (, )  (, ) =  +  =    = 0 
In the last step we used the Cauchy-Riemann equations to substitute  for  and  for .  
The lemma holds whether or not the gradients are 0. To guarantee that the level curves are smooth
the next theorem requires that  ()  0. 
Theorem. Let  =  +  and suppose that 
 () = (, ) + (, ) 
is analytic. If  ()  0 then the level curve of  through (, ) is orthogonal to the level curve  
through (, ). 
Proof. The technical requirement that  ()  0 is needed to be sure that the level curves are smooth. 
We need smoothness so that it even makes sense to ask if the curves are orthogonal. Well discuss
this below. Assuming the curves are smooth the proof of the theorem is trivial: We know from 
18.02 that the gradient  is orthogonal to the level curves of  and the same is true for  and 
the level curves of . Since, by Lemma 5.4, the gradients are orthogonal this implies the curves are 
orthogonal. 
Finally, we show that  ()  0 means the curves are smooth. First note that 
 () = (, )  (, ) = (, ) + (, ). 
Now, since  ()  0 we know that 
 = (, )  0. 
Likewise,   0. Thus, the gradients are not zero and the level curves must be smooth. 
Example 5.5. The gures below show level curves of  and  for a number of functions. In all cases, 
the level curves of  are in orange and those of  are in blue. For each case we show the level curves 
separately and then overlayed on each other.</text>

5 Introduction to harmonic functions 
5.1 Introduction 
Harmonic functions appear regularly and play a fundamental role in math, physics and engineering.
In this topic well learn the denition, some key properties and their tight connection to complex
analysis. The key connection to 18.04 is that both the real and imaginary parts of analytic functions
are harmonic. We will see that this is a simple consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. In
the next topic we will look at some applications to hydrodynamics. 
5.2 Harmonic functions 
We start by dening harmonic functions and looking at some of their properties. 
Denition 5.1. A function (, ) is called harmonic if it is twice continuously dierentiable and 
satises the following partial dierential equation: 
2 =  +  = 0. (1) 
Equation 1 is called Laplaces equation. So a function is harmonic if it satises Laplaces equation. 
The operator 2 is called the Laplacian and 2 is called the Laplacian of . 
5.3 Del notation 
Heres a quick reminder on the use of the notation . For a function (, ) and a vector eld 
(, ) = (, ), we have 
( ) 
  (i)  = ,   
(ii) grad  =  = (, ) 
(iii) curl  =    = (  ) 
(iv) div  =    =  +  
(v) div grad  =    = 2 =  +  
(vi) curl grad  =     = 0 
(vii) div curl  =      = 0.

          <text>5 INTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS 4 
It is a simple matter to apply the Laplacian and see that you get 0. Well leave the algebra to you!
The statement about () follows in either exactly the same way, or by noting that the Laplacian is 
translation invariant. 
Second proof that  analytic implies  and  are harmonic. We are proving that if  =  +  is 
analytic then  and  are harmonic. So, suppose  is analytic at the point 0. This means there is a 
disk of some radius, say , around 0 where  is analytic. Cauchys formula says 
1  ()  () = , 2     
where  is the circle   0 =  and  is in the disk   0 &lt; . 
Now, since the real and imaginary parts of 1(  ) are harmonic, the same must be true of the 
integral, which is limit of linear combinations of such functions. Since the circle is nite and  is 
continuous, interchanging the order of integration and dierentiation is not a problem. 
5.5 Maximum principle and mean value property 
These are similar to the corresponding properties of analytic functions. Indeed, we deduce them 
from those corresponding properties. 
Theorem. (Mean value property) If  is a harmonic function then  satises the mean value property. 
That is, suppose  is harmonic on and inside a circle of radius  centered at 0= 0+ 0 then 
2 1 (0, 0) = (0+ e)  2 0 
Proof. Let  =  +  be an analytic function with  as its real part. The mean value property for  
says 
2 1 (0, 0) + (0, 0) =  (0) =  (0+ e)  2 0 
2 1 (0+ e) + (0+ e)  = 2 0 
Looking at the real parts of this equation proves the theorem. 
Theorem. (Maximum principle) Suppose (, ) is harmonic on a open region . 
(i) Suppose 0 is in . If  has a relative maximum or minimum at 0 then  is constant on a disk 
centered at 0. 
(ii) If  is bounded and connected and  is continuous on the boundary of  then the absolute 
maximum and absolute minimum of  occur on the boundary. 
Proof. The proof for maxima is identical to the one for the maximum modulus principle. The proof
for minima comes by looking at the maxima of . 
Note. For analytic functions we only talked about maxima because we had to use the modulus in
order to have real values. Since   =   we couldnt use the trick of turning minima into maxima 
by using a minus sign.</text>

Since  is simply connected our statement of Cauchys theorem guarantees that () has an 
antiderivative in . Well need to fuss a little to get the constant of integration exactly right.
So, pick a base point 0 in . Dene the antiderivative of () by 
 
 () =  ()  + (0, 0). 
0 
(Again, by Cauchys theorem this integral can be along any path in  from 0 to .) 
4. Show that the real part of  is . 
Lets write  =  +  . So,  () =   . By construction 
 () = () =   . 
This means the rst partials of  and  are the same, so  and  dier by at most a constant. 
However, also by construction, 
 (0) = (0, 0) = (0, 0) +  (0, 0), 
So, (0, 0) = (0, 0) (and  (0, 0) = 0). Since they agree at one point we must have 
 = , i.e. the real part of  is  as we wanted to prove. 
Important corollary.  is innitely dierentiable. 
Proof. By denition we only require a harmonic function  to have continuous second partials. Since 
the analytic  is innitely dierentiable, we have shown that so is ! 
5.3.2 Harmonic conjugates 
Denition. If  and  are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function, then we say  and  
are harmonic conjugates . 
Note. If  () =  +  is analytic then so is  () =  + . So, if  and  are harmonic conjugates 
and so are  and . 
5.4 A second proof that  and  are harmonic 
This fact is important enough that we will give a second proof using Cauchys integral formula.
One benet of this proof is that it reminds us that Cauchys integral formula can transfer a general
question on analytic functions to a question about the function 1. We start with an easy to derive 
fact. 
Fact. The real and imaginary parts of  () = 1 are harmonic away from the origin. Likewise for 
1 () =  (  ) =    
away from the point  = . 
Proof. We have 
1   =    2+ 2 2+ 2 .</text>

5.3.1 Analytic functions have harmonic pieces 
The connection between analytic and harmonic functions is very strong. In many respects it mirrors
the connection between e and sine and cosine. 
Let  =  +  and write  () = (, ) + (, ). 
Theorem 5.2. If  () = (, ) + (, ) is analytic on a region  then both  and  are harmonic 
functions on . 
Proof. This is a simple consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since  =  we have 
 = . 
Likewise,  =  implies 
 = . 
Since  =  we have 
 +  =    = 0. 
Therefore  is harmonic. We can handle  similarly.  
Note. Since we know an analytic function is innitely dierentiable we know  and  have the 
required two continuous partial derivatives. This also ensures that the mixed partials agree, i.e. 
 = . 
To complete the tight connection between analytic and harmonic functions we show that any har-
monic function is the real part of an analytic function. 
Theorem 5.3. If (, ) is harmonic on a simply connected region , then  is the real part of an 
analytic function  () = (, ) + (, ). 
Proof. This is similar to our proof that an analytic function has an antiderivative. First we come up
with a candidate for  () and then show it has the properties we need. Here are the details broken 
down into steps 1-4. 
1. Find a candidate, call it (), for  (): 
 If we had an analytic  with  =  + , then Cauchy-Riemann says that  =   . So, 
lets dene 
 =   . 
 This is our candidate for  . 
2. Show that () is analytic: 
Write  =  + , where  =  and  = . Checking the Cauchy-Riemann equations we 
have [ ] [ ]     =     
Since  is harmonic we know  = , so  = . It is clear that  = . Thus  
satises the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so it is analytic.

really have a problem. Now, as  approaches the -axis from one side or the other, the argument of 
log(2  1) approaches either  or . That is, as such limits, the imaginary part is constant. So the 
streamline on the -axis is the limit case of streamlines near the axis. 
Since () = 0 when  = 0, the origin is a stagnation point. This is where the elds from the two
sources exactly cancel each other. 
Example 6.12. A source in uniform ow. Consider the ow with complex potential 
() =  +  log(). 2 
This is a combination of uniform ow to the right and a source at the origin. The gure below was
drawn using Octave. It shows that the ow looks like a source near the origin. Farther away from
the origin the ow stops being radial and is pushed to the right by the uniform ow. 
A source in uniform ow. 
Since the components of  and  are the same except for signs, we can understand the ow by 
considering 
 () = 1 + . 2 
Near  = 0 the singularity of 1 is most important and 
   . 2 
So, the vector eld looks a linear source. Far away from the origin the 1 term is small and ()  
1, so the eld looks like uniform ow. 
Setting () = 0 we nd one stagnation point 
 =   . 2 
It is the point on the -axis where the ow from the source exactly balances that from the uniform 
ow. For bigger values of  the source pushes uid farther out before being overwhelmed by the 
uniform ow. That is why  is called the source strength. 
Example 6.13. Source + sink. Consider the ow with complex potential 
() = log(  2)  log( + 2). 
This is a combination of source (log(  2)) at  = 2 and a sink ( log( + 2)) at  = 2.</text>

Theorem. Suppose that 
 =  +  
is the complex potential for a velocity eld . Then the uid ows along the level curves of . That 
is, the  is everywhere tangent to the level curves of . The level curves of  are called streamlines 
and  is called the stream function. 
Proof. Again we have already done most of the heavy lifting to prove this. Since  is the velocity 
of the ow at each point, the ow is always tangent to . You also need to remember that  is 
perpendicular to the level curves of . So we have: 
1. The ow is parallel to . 
2.  = , so the ow is orthogonal to the level curves of . 
3. Since  and  are harmonic conjugates, the level curves of  are orthogonal to the level curves 
of . 
Combining 2 and 3 we see that the ow must be along the level curves of . 
6.6.1 Examples 
Well illustrate the streamlines in a series of examples that start by dening the complex potential
for a vector eld. 
Example 6.7. Uniform ow. Let 
() = . 
Find  and draw a plot of the streamlines. Indicate the direction of the ow. 
Solution: Write 
 =  + . 
So 
 =  and  =  = (1, 0), 
which says the ow has uniform velocity and points to the right. We also have 
 = , 
so the streamlines are the horizontal lines  = constant. 
Uniform ow to the right.</text>

(B) Incompressibility. We will assume throughout that the uid is incompressible. This means that
the density of the uid is constant across the domain. Mathematically this says that the velocity eld 
 must be divergence free, i.e. for  = (, ): 
div     =  +  = 0. 
To understand this, recall that the divergence measures the innitesimal ux of the eld. If the ux
is not zero at a point (0, 0) then near that point the eld looks like 
Left: Divergent eld: div &gt; 0, right: Convergent eld: div &lt; 0 
If the eld is diverging or converging then the density must be changing! That is, the ow is not 
incompressible. 
As a uid ow the left hand picture represents a source and the right represents a sink. In electrostat-
ics where  expresses the electric eld, the left hand picture is the eld of a positive charge density
and the right is that of a negative charge density. 
If you prefer a non-innitesimal explanation, we can recall Greens theorem in ux form. It says 
that for a simple closed curve  and a eld  = (, ), dierentiable on and inside , the ux of  
through  satises 
Flux of  across      =   div  , =  
where  is the region inside . Now, suppose that div(0, 0) &gt; 0, then div(, ) &gt; 0 for all 
(, ) close to (0, 0). So, choose a small curve  around (0, 0) such that div &gt; 0 on and inside 
. By Greens theorem 
Flux of  through  div   &gt; 0. =   
Clearly, if there is a net ux out of the region the density is decreasing and the ow is not incom-
pressible. The same argument would hold if div(0, 0) &lt; 0. We conclude that incompressible is 
equivalent to divergence free. 
(C) Irrotational ow. We will assume that the uid is irrotational. This means that the there are no 
innitesimal vortices in . Mathematically this says that the velocity eld  must be curl free, i.e. 
for  = (, ): 
curl     =    = 0. 
To understand this, recall that the curl measures the innitesimal rotation of the eld. Physically this
means that a small paddle placed in the ow will not spin as it moves with the ow. 
6.4.2 Examples 
Example 6.4. The eddy is irrotational! The eddy from Example 6.2 is irrotational. The vortex at 
the origin is not in  =   {0} and you can easily check that curl = 0 everywhere in . This is</text>

Example 6.3. Source  = (2, 2) 
6.4 Physical assumptions, mathematical consequences 
This is a wordy section, so well start by listing the mathematical properties that will follow from
our assumptions about the velocity eld  =  + . 
(A)  = (, ) is a function of ,, but not time  (stationary). 
(B) div  = 0 (divergence free). 
(C) curl  = 0 (curl free). 
6.4.1 Physical assumptions 
We will make some standard physical assumptions. These dont apply to all ows, but they do 
apply to a good number of them and they are a good starting point for understanding uid ow 
more generally. More important to 18.04, these are the ows that are readily susceptible to complex 
analysis. 
Here are the assumptions about the ow, well discuss them further below: 
(A) The ow is stationary. 
(B) The ow is incompressible. 
(C) The ow is irrotational. 
We have already discussed stationarity in Section 6.3, so lets now discuss the other two properties.</text>

          <text>6 TWO DIMENSIONAL HYDRODYNAMICS AND COMPLEX POTENTIALS 4 
not physically impossible: if you placed a small paddle wheel in the ow it would travel around the
origin without spinning! 
Example 6.5. Shearing ows are rotational. Heres an example of a vector eld that has rotation, 
though not necessarily swirling. 
Re(z )Im(z )
Shearing ow: box turns because current is faster at the top. 
The eld  = (, 0) is horizontal, but curl =   0. Because the top moves faster than the bottom
it will rotate a square parcel of uid. The minus sign tells you the parcel will rotate clockwise! This
is called a shearing ow. The water at one level will be sheared away from the level above it. 
6.4.3 Summary 
(A) Stationary:  depends on , , but not , i.e., 
(, ) = ((, ), (, )). 
(B) Incompressible: divergence free: 
div =  +  = 0, i.e.  = . 
(C) Irrotational: curl free: 
curl =    = 0, i.e.,  = . 
For future reference we put the last two equalities in a numbered equation: 
 =  and  =  (1) 
These look almost like the Cauchy-Riemann equations (with sign dierences)! 
6.5 Complex potentials 
There are dierent ways to do this. Well start by seeing that every complex analytic function leads
to an irrotational, incompressible ow. Then well go backwards and see that all such ows lead to
an analytic function. We will learn to call the analytic function the complex potential of the ow. 
Annoyingly, we are going to have to switch notation. Because  and  are already taken by the vector 
eld , we will call our complex potential 
 =  + .</text>

Step 2: Since  is simply connected, Cauchys theorem says that () has an antiderivative on . 
We call the antiderivative (). 
Step 3: Show that () is a complex potential function for . This means we have to show that if 
we write  =  + , then  = . To do this we just unwind the denitions. 
 =    (standard formula for ) 
 =  =    (denition of  and  ) 
Comparing these equations we get 
 = ,  = . 
But this says precisely that  = . QED 
Example 6.6. Source elds. The vector eld 
( )    =  2 , 2 
models a source pushing out water or the 2D electric eld of a positive charge at the origin. (If you
prefer a 3D model, it is the eld of an innite wire with uniform charge density along the -axis.) 
Show that  is curl-free and divergence-free and nd its complex potential. 
We could compute directly that this is curl-free and divergence-free away from 0. An alternative 
method is to look for a complex potential . If we can nd one then this will show  is curl and 
divergence free and nd  and  all at once. If there is no such  then well know that  is not both 
curl and divergence free. 
One standard method is to use the formula for : 
(  )    =    =  =  = . 2 ()  
This is analytic and we have 
() =  log(). 
6.6 Stream functions 
In everything we did above poor old  just tagged along as the harmonic conjugate of the potential 
function . Lets turn our attention to it and see why its called the stream function.</text>

          <text>6 TWO DIMENSIONAL HYDRODYNAMICS AND COMPLEX POTENTIALS 8 
Note that another way to see that the ow is to the right is to check the direction that the potential  
increases. The Topic 5 notes show pictures of this complex potential which show both the streamlines
and the equipotential lines. 
Example 6.8. Linear source. Let 
() = log(). 
Find  and draw a plot of the streamlines. Indicate the direction of the ow. 
Solution: Write 
 = log() + . 
So 
 = log() and  =  = (2, 2), 
which says the ow is radial and decreases in speed as it gets farther from the origin. The eld is
not dened at  = 0. We also have 
 = , 
so the streamlines are rays from the origin. 
Linear source: radial ow from the origin. 
6.6.2 Stagnation points 
A stagnation point is one where the velocity eld is 0. 
Stagnation points. If  is the complex potential for a eld  then the stagnation points  = 0 are 
exactly the points  where () = 0 . 
Proof. This is clear since  = (, ) and  =   . 
Example 6.9. Stagnation points. Draw the streamlines and identify the stagnation points for the 
potential () = 2. 
Solution: (We drew the level curves for this in Topic 5.) We have 
 = ( 2 2) + 2. 
So the streamlines are the hyperbolas: 2 = constant. Since  = 2 2 increases as  increases 
and decreases as  increases, the arrows, which point in the direction of increasing , are as shown 
on the gure below.</text>

6 Two dimensional hydrodynamics and complex potentials 
6.1 Introduction 
Laplaces equation and harmonic functions show up in many physical models. As we have just seen,
harmonic functions in two dimensions are closely linked with complex analytic functions. In this
section we will exploit this connection to look at two dimensional hydrodynamics, i.e. uid ow. 
Since static electric elds and steady state temperature distributions are also harmonic, the ideas and
pictures we use can be repurposed to cover these topics as well. 
6.2 Velocity elds 
Suppose we have water owing in a region  of the plane. Then at every point (, ) in  the water 
has a velocity. In general, this velocity will change with time. Well let  stand for the velocity 
vector eld and we can write 
(, , ) = ( (, , ), (, , )). 
The arguments (, , ) indicate that the velocity depends on these three variables. In general, we 
will shorten the name to velocity eld. 
A beautiful and mesmerizing example of a velocity eld is at http://hint.fm/wind/index.html. 
This shows the current velocity of the wind at all points in the continental U.S. 
6.3 Stationary ows 
If the velocity eld is unchanging in time we call the ow a stationary ow. In this case, we can drop 
 as an argument and write: 
(, ) = ((, ), (, )) 
Here are a few examples. These pictures show the streamlines from similar gures in topic 5. Weve
added arrows to indicate the direction of ow. 
Example 6.1. Uniform ow.  = (1, 0). 
Example 6.2. Eddy (vortex)  = (2, 2)

6.5.1 Analytic functions give us incompressible, irrotational ows 
Let () be an analytic function on a region . For  =  +  we write 
() = (, ) + (, ). 
From this we can dene a vector eld 
 =  = (, ) = (, ), 
here we mean that  and  are dened by  and . 
From our work on analytic and harmonic functions we can make a list of properties of these functions. 
1.  and  are both harmonic. 
2. The level curves of  and  are orthogonal. 
3.  =   . 
4.  is divergence and curl free (proof just below). That is, the analytic function  has given us 
an incompressible, irrotational vector eld . 
It is standard terminology to call  a potential function for the vector eld . We will also call  a 
complex potential function for . The function  will be called the stream function of  (the name 
will be explained soon). The function  will be called the complex velocity. 
Proof. ( is curl and divergence free.) This is an easy consequence of the denition. We nd 
curl =    =    = 0 
div =  +  =  +  = 0 (since  is harmonic). 
Well postpone examples until after deriving the complex potential from the ow. 
6.5.2 Incompressible, irrotational ows always have complex potential functions 
For technical reasons we need to add the assumption that  is simply connected. This is not usually
a problem because we often work locally in a disk around a point (0, 0). 
Theorem. Assume  = (, ) is an incompressible, irrotational eld on a simply connected region 
. Then there is an analytic function  which is a complex potential function for . 
Proof. We have done all the heavy lifting for this in previous topics. The key is to use the property 
 =    to guess  . Working carefully we dene 
() =    
Step 1: Show that  is analytic. Keeping the signs straight, the Cauchy Riemann equations are 
 = () and  = () = . 
But, these are exactly the equations in Equation 1. Thus () is analytic.</text>

Stagnation ow: stagnation point at  = 0. 
The stagnation points are the zeros of 
() = 2 , 
i.e. the only stagnation point is at the  = 0. 
Note. The stagnation points are what we called the critical points of a vector eld in 18.03. 
6.7 More examples with pretty pictures 
Example 6.10. Linear vortex. Analyze the ow with complex potential function 
() =  log(). 
Solution: Multiplying by  switches the real and imaginary parts of log() (with a sign change). We 
have 
 =   +  log(). 
The stream lines are the curves log() = constant, i.e. circles with center at  = 0. The ow is 
clockwise because the potential  =  increases in the clockwise direction. 
Linear vortex. 
This ow is called a linear vortex. We can nd  using  . 
   = = +  =   .  2 2 
So 
 = (, ) = (2 , 2).</text>

          <text>6 TWO DIMENSIONAL HYDRODYNAMICS AND COMPLEX POTENTIALS 10 
(By now this should be a familiar vector eld.) There are no stagnation points, but there is a singu-
larity at the origin. 
Example 6.11. Double source. Analyze the ow with complex potential function 
() = log(  1) + log( + 1). 
Solution: This is a ow with linear sources at 1. We used Octave to plot the level curves of 
 = Im() . 
Two sources. 
We can analyze this ow further as follows. 
 Near each source the ow looks like a linear source. 
 On the -axis the ow is along the axis. That is, the -axis is a streamline. Its worth seeing 
three dierent ways of arriving at this conclusion. 
Reason 1: By symmetry of vector elds associated with each linear source, the  components cancel 
and the combined eld points along the -axis. Reason 2: We can write 
() = log(  1) + log( + 1) = log((  1)( + 1)) = log(
2  1). 
So 
() = 2 . 2 1 
On the imaginary axis 
2 () = . 2 1 
Thus, ( ) 2  = 0, 2+ 1 
which is along the axis. 
Reason 3: On the imaginary axis () = log( 2  1). Since this has constant imaginary part, the 
axis is a streamline. Because of the branch cut for log() we should probably be a little more careful here. First note that 
the vector eld  comes from 
 = 2(2  1), which doesnt have a branch cut. So we shouldnt</text>

1. Any line not through the origin is mapped to a circle through the origin. 
2. Any line through the origin is mapped to a line through the origin. 
3. Any circle not through the origin is mapped to a circle not through the origin. 
4. Any circle through the origin is mapped to a line not through the origin. 
Now, to prove that an arbitrary fractional linear transformation maps lines and circles to lines and
circles, we factor it into a sequence of simpler transformations. 
First suppose that  = 0. So, 
 () = ( + ). 
Since this is just translation, scaling and rotating, it is clear it maps circles to circles and lines to
lines. 
Now suppose that   0. Then, 
 ( + ) +    
 +        () = = = +  +   +    +  
So,  =  () can be computed as a composition of transforms 
  1=  +   2 = 11   =  + (  )2  
We know that each of the transforms in this sequence maps lines and circles to lines and circles.
Therefore the entire sequence does also.  
10.7.3 Mapping  to  
It turns out that for two sets of three points 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3 there is a fractional linear 
transformation that takes  to  . We can construct this map as follows. 
Let (  1)(2 3) 1() = (  3)(2 1). 
Notice that 
1(1) = 0, 1(2) = 1, 1(3) = . 
Likewise let 
(  1)(2 3) 2() = (  3)(2 1). 
Notice that 
2(1) = 0, 2(2) = 1, 2(3) = . 
Now  () =  11() is the required map. 2</text>

Solution: The map  () = e does the trick. (See the Topic 1 notes!) 
You supply the picture: horizontal lines get mapped to rays from the origin and vertical segments

The calculations from 1 are all trivial. 
Notes. 
1. It is possible, but more tedious and less insightful, to arrive at this theorem by direct calcula-
tion. 
2. If  is on the unit circle then 1 = . That is,  is its own reection in the unit circle as it 
should be. 
3. The center of the circle 0 is symmetric to the point at . 
The gure below shows three pairs of points symmetric in the unit circle:

Example 10.17. Reection in the circle of radius . Suppose  is the circle  =  and 1 is a 
point not on . Find the reection of 1 in . 
Solution: Our strategy is to map  to the unit circle, nd the reection and then map the unit circle 
back to . 
Start with the map  () =  = . Clearly  maps  to the unit circle and 
1=  (1) = 1. 
The reection of 1 is 
2 = 11= 1. 
Mapping back from the unit circle by  1 we have 
2=  1(2) = 2= 21. 
Therefore the reection of 1 is 21.</text>

Useful fact. If () is analytic then so is () = () and  () =  (). 
Proof. Use the Taylor series for  to get the Taylor series for  and then compare  () and  ().  
Using this we have 
() =1 1

For large  the second term decays much faster than the rst, so 
()  1

That is, far from  = 0, the velocity eld looks just like the velocity eld for  (), i.e. the velocity 
eld of a source at  = 2.

() = 2 
we can transform a ow from the upper half-plane to the rst quadrant

10.11 Examples of conformal maps and excercises 
As weve seen, once we have ows or harmonic functions on one region, we can use conformal maps
to map them to other regions. In this section we will oer a number of conformal maps between
various regions. By chaining these together along with scaling, rotating and shifting we can build a
large library of conformal maps. Of course there are many many others that we will not touch on. 
For convenience, in this section we will let 
   0() = .  +  
This is our standard map of taking the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
Example 10.29. Let  be the half-plane above the line 
 = tan(),</text>

For any real , 1=  and 2 = 1 are symmetric in the unit circle. We can choose a specic  so 
that  and 1 are equidistant from , i.e. also symmetric in the line  = . It is clear geometrically 
that this can be done. Algebraically we solve the equation 
   + 1 1 =   2 2 + 1 = 0   =  + 2 1  =   2 1. 2  
  
Thus 1=  1( + 2  1) and 2=  1(  2  1) are the required points. 
Example 10.20. Show that if two circles dont intersect then there is a pair of points 1, 2 that is 
symmetric with respect to both circles. 
Solution: Using a fractional linear transformation that maps one of the circles to a line (and the other
to a circle) we can reduce the problem to that in the previous example. 
Example 10.21. Show that any two circles that dont intersect can be mapped conformally to con-
centric circles. 
Solution: Call the circles 1 and 2. Using the previous example start with a pair of points 1, 2 
which are symmetric in both circles. Next, pick a fractional linear transformation  that maps 1 to 
0 and 2 to innity. For example,   1  () = .   2 
Since  preserves symmetry 0 and  are symmetric in the circle  (1). This implies that 0 is the 
center of  (1). Likewise 0 is the center of  (2). Thus,  (1) and  (2) are concentric. 
10.9 Solving the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions 
In general, a Dirichlet problem in a region  asks you to solve a partial dierential equation in  
where the values of the solution on the boundary of  are speciced. 
Example 10.22. Find a function  harmonic on the unit disk such that 
{
1 for 0 &lt;  &lt;  (e) = 0 for  &lt;  &lt; 0 
This is a Dirichlet problem because the values of  on the boundary are specied. The partial dier -
ential equation is implied by requiring that  be harmonic, i.e. we require 2 = 0. We will solve 
this problem in due course. 
10.9.1 Harmonic functions on the upper half-plane 
Our strategy will be to solve the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the upper half-plane
and then transfer these solutions to other domains. 
Example 10.23. Find a harmonic function (, ) on the upper half-plane that satises the boundary 
condition {
1 for  &lt; 0 (, 0) = 0 for  &gt; 0</text>

10.5 Digression to harmonic functions 
Theorem 10.9. If  and  are harmonic conjugates and  =  +  has  (0)  0, then the level 
curves of  and  through 0 are orthogonal. 
Note. We proved this in an earlier topic using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Here will make an
argument involving conformal maps. 
Proof. First well examine how  maps the level curve (, ) = . Since  =  + , the image of 
the level curve is  =  + , i.e its (contained in) a vertical line in the -plane. Likewise, the level 
curve (, ) =  is mapped to the horizontal line  =  + . 
Thus, the images of the two level curves are orthogonal. Since  is conformal it preserves the angle 
between the level curves, so they must be orthogonal.

10.6 Riemann mapping theorem 
The Riemann mapping theorem is a major theorem on conformal maps. The proof is fairly technical
and we will skip it. In practice, we will write down explicit conformal maps between regions. 
Theorem 10.10. (Riemann mapping theorem ) If  is simply connected and not the whole plane, 
then there is a bijective conformal map from  to the unit disk. 
Corollary. For any two such regions there is a bijective conformal map from one to the other. We 
say they are conformally equivalent. 
10.7 Fractional linear transformations 
Denition. A fractional linear transformation is a function of the form 
 +   () = , where , , ,  are complex constants and     0  +  
These are also called Mobius transforms or bilinear transforms. We will abbreviate fractional linear 
transformation as FLT. 
Simple point. If    = 0 then  () is a constant function.</text>

In 18.04, we use parametrized curves () = () + () in the complex plane. Considered this way, 
the tangent vector is just the derivative: 
 () =  () +  (). 
It should be clear that these representations are equivalent. The vector (  ,  ) and the complex 
number  +   both represent the same displacement. Also, the length of a vector and the angle
between two vectors is the same in both representations. 
Thinking of tangent vectors to curves as complex numbers allows us to recast conformality in terms
of complex numbers. 
Theorem 10.3. If  () is conformal at 0 then there is a complex number  = e such that the 
map  multiplies tangent vectors at 0 by . Conversely, if the map  multiplies all tangent vectors 
at 0 by  = e then  is conformal at 0. 
Proof. By denition  is conformal at 0 means that there is an angle  and a scalar  &gt; 0 such 
that the map  rotates tangent vectors at 0 by  and scales them by . This is exactly the eect of 
multiplication by  = e. 
10.4 Analytic functions are conformal 
Theorem 10.4. (Operational denition of conformal) If  is analytic on the region  and  (0)  0, 
then  is conformal at 0. Furthermore, the map  multiplies tangent vectors at 0 by  (0). 
Proof. The proof is a quick computation. Suppose  = () is curve through 0 with (0) = 0. The 
curve  () is transformed by  to the curve  =  (()). By the chain rule we have 
 (()) =  ((0)) (0) =  (0) (0).  0 
The theorem now follows from Theorem 10.3. 
Example 10.5. (Basic example) Suppose  = e and consider the map  () = . Geometrically, 
this map rotates every point by  and scales it by . Therefore, it must have the same eect on all 
tangent vectors to curves. Indeed,  is analytic and  () =  is constant. 
Example 10.6. Let  () = 2. So  () = 2 . Thus the map  has a dierent aect on tangent 
vectors at dierent points 1 and 2. 
Example 10.7. (Linear approximation ) Suppose  () is analytic at  = 0. The linear approximation 
(rst two terms of the Taylor series) is 
 ()   (0) +  (0). 
If () is a curve with (0) = 0 then, near 0, 
 (())   (0) +  (0)(). 
That is, near 0,  looks like our basic example plus a shift by  (0). 
Example 10.8. The map  () =  has lots of nice geometric properties, but it is not conformal. It
preserves the length of tangent vectors and the angle between tangent vectors. The reason it isnt 
conformal is that is does not rotate tangent vectors. Instead, it reects them across the -axis. 
In other words, it reverses the orientation of a pair of vectors. Our denition of conformal maps 
requires that it preserves orientation.</text>

10 Conformal transformations 
10.1 Introduction 
In this topic we will look at the geometric notion of conformal maps. It will turn out that analytic
functions are automatically conformal. Once we have understood the general notion, we will look
at a specic family of conformal maps called fractional linear transformations and, in particular at
their geometric properties. As an application we will use fractional linear transformations to solve
the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the unit disk with specied values on the unit circle.
At the end we will return to some questions of uid ow. 
10.2 Geometric denition of conformal mappings 
We start with a somewhat hand-wavy denition: 
Informal denition. Conformal maps are functions on  that preserve the angles between curves. 
More precisely: Suppose  () is dierentiable at 0 and () is a smooth curve through 0. To be 
concrete, lets suppose (0) = 0. The function maps the point 0 to 0=  (0) and the curve  to 
 () =  (()). 
Under this map, the tangent vector  (0) at 0 is mapped to the tangent vector 
  (0) = ( )(0) 
at 0. With these notations we have the following denition. 
Denition. The function  () is conformal at 0 if there is an angle  and a scale  &gt; 0 such that 
for any smooth curve () through 0 the map  rotates the tangent vector at 0 by  and scales it by 
. That is, for any , the tangent vector ( )(0) is found by rotating  (0) by  and scaling it by 
. 
If  () is dened on a region , we say it is a conformal map on  if it is conformal at each point  
in . Note. The scale factor  and rotation angle  depends on the point , but not on any of the curves 
through . 
Example 10.1. The gure below shows a conformal map  () mapping two curves through 
0 to 
two curves through 0=  (0). The tangent vectors to each of the original curves are both rotated 
and scaled by the same amount.

To convince yourself that  satises the boundary condition test a few points: 
 At 3: all the  = 0. So, (3, 0) = 3 as required. 
 At 2: 1= 2= 0, 3= . So, (2, 0) = 3+ 2 3= 2 as required. 
 Likewise, at 1 and 0,  have the correct values. 
As before,  is harmonic because it is the real part of the analytic function 
(2 3) (1 2) (1 0) () = 3 + log(  3) + log(  2) + log(  1).    
10.9.2 Harmonic functions on the unit disk 
Lets try to solve a problem similar to the one in Example 10.22. 
Example 10.25. Find a function  harmonic on the unit disk such that 
{ 
(e) = 1 for 2 &lt;  &lt; 2 
0 for 2 &lt;  &lt; 32 
xy

iu= 1 u= 0z
Solution: Our strategy is to start with a conformal map  from the upper half-plane to the unit disk.
We can use this map to pull the problem back to the upper half-plane. We solve it there and then
push the solution back to the disk. 
Lets call the disk , the upper half-plane . Let  be the variable on  and  the variable on . 
Back in Example 10.14 we found a map from  to . The map and its inverse are 
    +   =  () = ,  =  1() =  +   + 1.

10.10.2 Examples 
Think of  () as representing ow, possibly with sources or vortices outside  = . Then () 
represents the new ow when a circular obstacle is placed in the ow. Here are a few examples. 
Example 10.26. (Uniform ow around a circle ) We know from Topic 6 that  () =  is the complex 
potential for uniform ow to the right. So, 
() =  + 2 
is the potential for uniform ow around a circle of radius  centered at the origin. 
Uniform ow around a circle 
Just because they look nice, the gure includes streamlines inside the circle. These dont interact 
with the ow outside the circle. 
Note, that as  gets large ow looks uniform. We can see this analytically because 
() = 1  22 
goes to 1 as  gets large. (Recall that the velocity eld is (, ), where  =  +  ...) 
Example 10.27. (Source ow around a circle) Here the source is at  = 2 (outside the unit circle) 
with complex potential 
 () = log( + 2). 
With the appropriate branch cut the singularities of  are also outside  = 1. So we can apply 
Milne-Thomson and obtain (1 ) 
() = log( + 2) + log + 2  
Source ow around a circle 
We know that far from the origin the ow should look the same as a ow with just a source at  = 2. 
Lets see this analytically. First we state a useful fact:</text>

Note that  is the fractional linear transformation with coecients 
[ ] [ ]     = .   0 1 
Example 10.13. (Inversion ) Let  () = 1. This is called an inversion. It turns the unit circle 
inside out. Note that  (0) =  and  () = 0. In the gure below the circle that is outside the unit 
circle in the  plane is inside the unit circle in the  plane and vice-versa. Note that the arrows on 
the curves are reversed.

1iz7!w= 1/z
The map  = 1 inverts the plane. 
Note that  is the fractional linear transformation with coecients 
[ ] [ ]   0 1 = .   1 0 
Example 10.14. Let 
    () = .  +  
We claim that this maps the -axis to the unit circle and the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
Proof. First take  real, then 
 
   2+ 1  () =  +  =  = 1. 
2+ 1 
So,  maps the -axis to the unit circle. 
Next take  =  +  with  &gt; 0, i.e.  in the upper half-plane. Clearly 
 + 1 &gt;   1, 
so 
 +  =  + ( + 1) &gt;  + (  1) =   , 
implying that 
    () =  +  &lt; 1. 
So,  maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
We will use this map frequently, so for the record we note that 
 () = 0 ,  () = 1,  (1) = ,  (0) = 1,  (1) = .</text>

10.8 Reection and symmetry 
10.8.1 Reection and symmetry in a line 
Example 10.16. Suppose we have a line  and a point 1 not on . The reection of 1 in  is the 
point 2 so that  is the perpendicular bisector to the line segment 12. Since there is exactly one 
such point 2, the reection of a point in a line is unique. 
Denition. If 2 is the reection of 1 in , we say that 1 and 2 are symmetric with respect to the 
line  . 
In the gure below the points 1 and 2 are symmetric in the -axis. The points 3 and 4 are 
symmetric in the line .

In order to dene the reection of a point in a circle we need to work a little harder. Looking back 
at the previous example we can show the following. 
Fact. If 1 and 2 are symmetric in the line , then any circle through 1 and 2 intersects  
orthogonally. 
Proof. Call the circle . Since  is the perpendicular bisector of a chord of , the center of  lies 
on  . Therefore  is a radial line, i.e. it intersects  orthogonally.

Solution: We can write down a solution explicitly as 
1 (, ) = ,  
where  is the argument of  =  + . Since we are only working on the upper half-plane we can
take any convenient branch with branch cut in the lower half-plane, say  2 &lt;  &lt; 32.

To show  is truly a solution, we have to verify two things: 
1.  satises the boundary conditions 
2.  is harmonic. 
) Both of these are straightforward. First, look at the point 2 on the positive -axis. This has argument 
 = 0, so (2, 0) = 0. Likewise arg(1) = , so (1, 0) = 1. Thus, we have shown point (1). 
To see point (2) remember that 
log() = log() + . 
So, ( 1  = Re log()  
Since it is the real part of an analytic function,  is harmonic. . 
Example 10.24. Suppose 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3. Find a harmonic function  on the upper half-plane that 
satises the boundary condition

3 2 1 (, ) = 3+ (2 3) + (1 2) + (0 1) .    
Here, the  are the angles shown in the gure. One again, we chose a branch of  that has 0 &lt;  &lt;  
for points in the upper half-plane. (For example the branch  2 &lt;  &lt; 32.)

10.7.4 Correspondence with matrices 
We can identify the transformation 
 +   () =  +  
with the matrix [ ]   .   
This identication is useful because of the following algebraic facts.
[ ] [ ]     1. If   0 then and  correspond to the same FLT.     
Proof. This follows from the obvious equality 
 +   +  = .  +   +  
[ ] [ ]     2. If  () corresponds to  = and () corresponds to  = then composition     
 () corresponds to matrix multiplication . 
Proof. The proof is just a bit of algebra. 
( )  +   (( +  )( + )) +  ( + ) +  +   () =  = =  +   (( +  )( + )) +  ( + ) +  +  [ ] [ ] [ ]      +   +   = =      +   +  
The claimed correspondence is clear from the last entries in the two lines above.
[ ]   3. If  () corresponds to  = then  has an inverse and  1() corresponds to 1 and   [ ]   also to , i.e. to 1 without the factor of 1 det().   
Proof. Since 1 =  it is clear from the previous fact that  1 corresponds to 1. Since 
[ ] 
1   1 =      
[ ]   Fact 1 implies 1 and both correspond to the same FLT, i.e. to  1.   
Example 10.15. 
[ ]   1. The matrix 0 1 corresponds to  () =  + . 
[ ] e 
2. The matrix e0 
 corresponds to rotation by 2 . 0 
[ ] 0 1 3. The matrix 1 0 corresponds to the inversion  = 1.</text>

10.8.2 Reection and symmetry in a circle 
We will adapt this for our denition of reection in a circle. So that the logic ows correctly we 
need to start with the denition of symmetric pairs of points. 
Denition. Suppose  is a line or circle. A pair of points 1, 2 is called symmetric with respect to 
 if every line or circle through the two points intersects  orthogonally. 
First we state an almost trivial fact. 
Fact. Fractional linear transformations preserve symmetry. That is, if 1 and 2 are symmetric in a 
line or circle  , then, for an FLT  ,  (1) and  (2) are symmetric in  (). 
Proof. The denition of symmetry is in terms of lines and circles, and angles. Fractional linear 
transformations map lines and circles to lines and circles and, being conformal, preserve angles.  
Theorem. Suppose  is a line or circle and 1 a point not on . There is a unique point 2 such that 
the pair 1, 2 is symmetric in . 
Proof. Let  be a fractional linear transformation that maps  to a line. We know that 1=  (1) 
has a unique reection 2 in this line. Since  1 preserves symmetry, 1 and 2=  1(2) are 
symmetric in . Since 2 is the unique point symmetric to 1 the same is true for 2 vis-a-vis 1. 
This is all shown in the gure below. 
xy
z1z2=T1(w2)S
xy
w1=T(z1)w2T(S)w=T(z)
We can now dene reection in a circle. 
Denition. The point 2 in the theorem is called the reection of 1 in . 
10.8.3 Reection in the unit circle 
Using the symmetry preserving feature of fractional linear transformations, we start with a line and
transform to the circle. Let  be the real axis and  the unit circle. We know the FLT

maps  to . We also know that the points  and  are symmetric in . Therefore 
      1=  () = and 2=  () =  +   +  
are symmetric in . Looking at the formulas, it is clear that 2 = 11. This is important enough 
that we highlight it as a theorem.

These relationships determine the boundary values of  from those we were given for . We compute: 
 1() = 1,  1() = 1 ,  1(1) = ,  1(1) = 0. 
This shows the left hand semicircle bounding  is mapped to the segment [1, 1] on the real axis. 
Likewise, the right hand semicircle maps to the two half-lines shown. (Literally, to the segment 1 
to  to 1.) 
We know how to solve the problem for a harmonic function  on  : 
( ) 1 () = 1  1 2+ 1= Re 1  1 log(  1) + 1 log( + 1) .     
Transforming this back to the disk we have 
( ) 
() =  1() = Re 1  1 log( 1()  1) + 1 log( 1() + 1) .   
If we wanted to, we could simplify this somewhat using the formula for  1.

10.10.1 Milne-Thomson circle theorem 
The Milne-Thomson theorem allows us to insert a circle into a two-dimensional ow and see how 
the ow adjusts. First well state and prove the theorem. 
Theorem. (Milne-Thomson circle theorem) If  () is a complex potential with all its singularities 
outside  =  then ( ) 
2 
() =  () +   
is a complex potential with streamline on  =  and the same singularities as  in the region 
 &gt; . 
Proof. First note that 2 is the reection of  in the circle  = . 
Next we need to see that  (2) is analytic for  &gt; . By assumption  () is analytic for   , 
so it can be expressed as a Taylor series 
 () = 0+ 1 + 22+  (1) 
Therefore, ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 2 
 = 0+ 1 + 2 +  (2)    
All the singularities of  are outside  = , so the Taylor series in Equation 1 converges for 
  . This means the Laurent series in Equation 2 converges for   . That is,  (2) is 
analytic for   , i.e. it introduces no singularies to () outside  = . 
The last thing to show is that  =  is a streamline for (). This follows because for  = e 
(e) =  (e) +  (e) 
is real. Therefore 
(e) = Im((e) = 0.</text>

Pairs of points  ;  symmetric in the circle of radius 2. 
Example 10.18. Find the reection of 1 in the circle of radius  centered at . 
Solution: Let  () = (  ).  maps the circle centered at  to the unit circle. The inverse map 
is 
 1() =  + . 
So, the reection of 1 is given by mapping  to  (), reecting this in the unit circle, and mapping 
back to the original geometry with  1. That is, the reection 2 is 
1   2 
1    2= + .  1  1  
We can now record the following important fact. 
Fact. (Reection of the center) For a circle  with center  the pair  ,  is symmetric with respect 
to the circle. 
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the formula for the reection of a point in a circle. For
example, the reection of  in the unit circle is 1. So, the reection of 0 is innity. 
Example 10.19. Show that if a circle and a line dont intersect then there is a pair of points 1, 2 
that is symmetric with respect to both the line and circle. 
Solution: By shifting, scaling and rotating we can nd a fractional linear transformation  that maps
the circle and line to the following conguration: The circle is mapped to the unit circle and the line
to the vertical line  =  &gt; 1.

This was clearly more work than we want to do for every limit. Fortunately, most of the time we can
apply general rules to determine a limit without resorting to epsilons! 
Remarks. 
1. In 18.04 we will be able to spot the limit of most concrete examples of sequences. The formal
denition is needed when dealing abstractly with sequences. 
2. To mathematicians  is one of the go-to symbols for a small number. The prominent and rather
eccentric mathematician Paul Erdos used to refer to children as epsilons, as in How are the
epsilons doing? 
3. The term captured by the circle is not in common usage, but it does capture what is happen-
ing. 
2.11.2 lim  () 
0 
Sometimes we need limits of the form lim  () = . Again, the intuitive meaning is clear: as  gets 
0 
close to 0 we should see  () get close to . Here is the technical denition 
Denition. Suppose  () is dened on a punctured disk 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  around 0. We say 
lim  () =  if for every  &gt; 0 there is a  such that 
0 
 ()   &lt;  whenever 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  
This says exactly that as  gets closer (within ) to 0 we have  () is close (within ) to . Since  
can be made as small as we want,  () must go to . 
Remarks. 
1. Using the punctured disk (also called a deleted neighborhood) means that  () does not have 
to be dened at 0 and, if it is then  (0) does not necessarily equal . If  (0) =  then we 
say the  is continuous at 0. 
2. Ask any mathematician to complete the phrase For every  and the odds are that they will 
respond there is a  ... 
2.11.3 Connection between limits of sequences and limits of functions 
Heres an equivalent way to dene limits of functions: the limit lim  () =  if, for every sequence 
0 
of points {} with limit 0 the sequence { ()} has limit .</text>

Remember: The limit has to exist and be the same no matter how you approach 0! 
If  is analytic at all the points in an open region  then we say  is analytic on . 
As usual with derivatives there are several alternative notations. For example, if  =  () we can 
write 
  ()   (0)    (0) = = lim = lim  0   00  0 
Example 2.8. Find the derivative of  () = 2. 
Solution: We did this above in Example 2.1. Take a look at that now. Of course,  () = 2 . 
Example 2.9. Show  () =  is not dierentiable at any point . 
Solution: We did this above in Example 2.2. Take a look at that now. 
Challenge. Use polar coordinates to show the limit in the previous example can be any value with
modulus 1 depending on the angle at which  approaches 0. 
2.6.1 Derivative rules 
It wouldnt be much fun to compute every derivative using limits. Fortunately, we have the same
dierentiation formulas as for real-valued functions. That is, assuming  and  are dierentiable we 
have: 
  Sum rule: ( () + ()) =  +   
 
  Product rule: ( ()()) =    +   
 
       
 Quotient rule: ( () ()) =  2 
  Chain rule: ( ()) =  ( ()) ()  
1  Inverse rule:  1()=   ( 1()) 
To give you the avor of these arguments well prove the product rule. 
  ()()   (0)(0) ( ()()) = lim  0   0 
( ()   (0))() +  (0)(()  (0)) = lim 
0   0 
 ()   (0) (()  (0)) = lim () +  (0) 
0   0   0 
=  (0)(0) +  (0) (0) 
Here is an important fact that you would have guessed. We will prove it in the next section. 
Theorem. If  () is dened and dierentiable on an open disk and  () = 0 on the disk then  () 
is constant.</text>

2.10 Branch cuts and function composition 
We often compose functions, i.e.  (()). In general in this case we have the chain rule to compute 
the derivative. However we need to specify the domain for  where the function is analytic. And
when branches and branch cuts are involved we need to take care. 
Example 2.14. Let  () = e2 . Since e and 2 are both entire functions, so is  () = e2 . The 
chain rule gives us 
 () = e2(2). 
Example 2.15. Let  () = e and () = 1.  () is entire and () is analytic everywhere but 0. 
So  (()) is analytic except at 0 and 
 (()) 1  1 =  (()) () = e  2 . 
Example 2.16. Let () = 1(e  1). Clearly  is entire except where the denominator is 0. The 
denominator is 0 when e  1 = 0. That is, when  = 2 for any integer . Thus, () is analytic 
on the set 
  {2, where  is any integer } 
The quotient rule gives  () = e(e  1)2. A little more formally: () =  (()). where 
 () = 1 and  = () = e  1. We know that () is entire and  () is analytic everywhere 
except  = 0. Therefore,  (()) is analytic everywhere except where  () = 0. 
Example 2.17. It can happen that the derivative has a larger domain where it is analytic than the
original function. The main example is  () = log(). This is analytic on  minus a branch cut. 
However 
 1 log() =   
is analytic on   {0}. The converse cant happen.
 
Example 2.18. Dene a region where 1   is analytic. 
Solution: Choosing the principal branch of argument, we have  
 is analytic on 
  {  0,  = 0}, (see gure below.) . 
So  
1   is analytic except where  = 1   is on the branch cut, i.e. where  = 1   is real and 
 0. Its easy to see that 
 = 1   is real and  0   is real and  1. 
 
So 1   is analytic on the region (see gure below) 
  {  1,  = 0} 
Note. A dierent branch choice for  
 would lead to a dierent region where  
1   is analytic.</text>

 If 2  0 then lim  () () = 12 0 
 If () is continuous and dened on a neighborhood of 1 then lim ( ()) = (1) 
0
(Note: we will give the ocial denition of continuity in the next section.) 
We wont give a proof of these properties. As a challenge, you can try to supply it using the formal
denition of limits given in the appendix. 
We can restate the denition of limit in terms of functions of (, ). To this end, lets write 
 () =  ( + ) = (, ) + (, ) 
and abbreviate 
 = (, ), 0= (0, 0), 0= 0+ 0. 
Then {
lim 0 (, ) = 0 lim  () = 0 i 
0 lim 0 (, ) = 0. 
Note. The term i stands for if and only if which is another way of saying is equivalent to. 
2.4.2 Continuous functions 
A function is continuous if it doesnt have any sudden jumps. This is the gist of the following 
denition. 
Denition. If the function  () is dened on an open disk around 0 and lim  () =  (0) then we 
0 
say  is continuous at 0. If  is dened on an open region  then the phrase  is continuous on 
 means that  is continuous at every point in . 
As usual, we can rephrase this in terms of functions of (, ): 
Fact.  () = (, ) + (, ) is continuous i (, ) and (, ) are continuous as functions of 
two variables. 
Example 2.5. (Some continuous functions)
(i) A polynomial 
 () = 0+ 1 + 22+  +  
is continuous on the entire plane. Reason: it is clear that each power ( + ) is continuous as a 
function of (, ). 
(ii) The exponential function is continuous on the entire plane. Reason: 
e = e+ = e cos() + e sin(). 
So the both the real and imaginary parts are clearly continuous as a function of (, ). 
(iii) The principal branch Arg() is continuous on the plane minus the non-positive real axis. Reason:
this is clear and is the reason we dened branch cuts for arg. We have to remove the negative real 
axis because Arg() jumps by 2 when you cross it. We also have to remove  = 0 because Arg() 
is not even dened at 0.</text>

2.8 Cauchy-Riemann all the way down 
Weve dened an analytic function as one having a complex derivative. The following theorem 
 shows that if  is analytic then so is  . Thus, there are derivatives all the way down! 
Theorem 2.13. Assume the second order partials of  and  exist and are continuous. If  () = + 
is analytic, then so is  (). 
Proof. To show this we have to prove that  () satises the Cauchy-Riemann equations. If  = + 
we know 
  = ,  = ,  =  + . 
Lets write 
  =  +  , 
so, by Cauchy-Riemann, 
 =  = ,  =  = . (2) 
We want to show that  =  and  = . We do them one at a time. 
To prove  = , we use Equation 2 to see that 
 =  and  = . 
Since  = , we have  = . 
Similarly, to show  = , we compute 
 =  and  = . 
So,  = . QED. 
Technical point. Weve assumed as many partials as we need. So far we cant guarantee that all the
partials exist. Soon we will have a theorem which says that an analytic function has derivatives of
all order. Well just assume that for now. In any case, in most examples this will be obvious. 
2.9 Gallery of functions 
In this section well look at many of the functions you know and love as functions of . For each 
one well have to do three things. 
1. Dene how to compute it. 
2. Specify a branch (if necessary) giving its range. 
3. Specify a domain (with branch cut if necessary) where it is analytic. 
4. Compute its derivative. 
Most often, we can compute the derivatives of a function using the algebraic rules like the quotient
rule. If necessary we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations or, as a last resort, even the denition
of the derivative as a limit. 
Before we start on the gallery we dene the term entire function. 
Denition. A function that is analytic at every point in the complex plane is called an entire function. 
We will see that e, , sin() are all entire functions.</text>

2.11.1 Limits of sequences 
Intuitively, we say a sequence of complex numbers 1, 2,  converges to  if for large ,  is really 
close to . To be a little more precise, if we put a small circle of radius  around  then eventually the 
sequence should stay inside the circle. Lets refer to this as the sequence being captured by the circle.
This has to be true for any circle no matter how small, though it may take longer for the sequence to
be captured by a smaller circle. 
This is illustrated in the gure below. The sequence is strung along the curve shown heading towards 
. The bigger circle of radius 2 captures the sequence by the time  = 47, the smaller circle doesnt 
capture it till  = 59. Note that 25 is inside the larger circle, but since later points are outside the
circle we dont say the sequence is captured at  = 25 
A sequence of points converging to  
Denition. The sequence 1, 2, 3,  converges to the value  if for every  &gt; 0 there is a number 
 such that    &lt;  for all  &gt;  . We write this as 
lim  = . 
 
Again, the denition just says that eventually the sequence is within  of , no matter how small you 
choose  . 
Example 2.20. Show that the sequence  = (1 + )2 has limit -1. 
Solution: This is clear because 1  0. For practice, lets phrase it in terms of epsilons: given 
 &gt; 0 we have to choose  such that 
  (1) &lt;  for all  &gt;  
One strategy is to look at  + 1 and see what  should be. We have 
1 2 1 2   (1) = 
(
 1+ )2
+ 1 
 = 
2+   &lt; 2+  
So all we have to do is pick  large enough that 
1 2 + &lt;  2   
Since this can clearly be done we have proved that   .</text>

Branch: Any branch of log(). 
Domain: Generally the domain is  minus a branch cut of log. If  is an integer  0 then  
is entire. If  is a negative integer then  is dened and analytic on   {0}. 
 
= 1 .  
12. sin1()  
Denition. sin1() =  log( + 1  2). 
The denition is chosen so that sin(sin1()) = . The derivation of the formula is as follows. 
Let  = sin1(), so  = sin(). Then, 
e  e 2  2e  1 = 0  =  e 2 
Solving the quadratic in e gives 
  2 + 42+ 4 e = =  + 1  2. 2 
Taking the log gives 
  
 = log( + 1  2)   =  log( + 1  2). 
From the denition we can compute the derivative: 
 sin1() =  1 .  1  2 
Choosing a branch is tricky because both the square root and the log require choices. We will
look at this more carefully in the future. 
For now, the following discussion and gure are for your amusement. 
Sine (likewise cosine) is not a 1-1 function, so if we want sin1() to be single-valued then we 
have to choose a region where sin() is 1-1. (This will be a branch of sin1(), i.e. a range for 
the image,) The gure below shows a domain where sin() is 1-1. The domain consists of the 
vertical strip  =  +  with 2 &lt;  &lt; 2 together with the two rays on boundary where 
  0 (shown as red lines). The gure indicates how the regions making up the domain in the 
-plane are mapped to the quadrants in the -plane.

Solution: Again, lets take  
 to be analytic on the region 
  {  0,  = 0} 
So,  () is analytic except where 1 + e is real and  0. That is, except where e is real and  1. 
Now, e = ee is real only when  is a multiple of . It is negative only when  is an odd mutltiple 
of . It has magnitude greater than 1 only when  &gt; 0. Therefore  () is analytic on the region 
  {  0,  = odd multiple of }

2.11 Appendix: Limits 
The intuitive idea behind limits is relatively simple. Still, in the 19th century mathematicians were
troubled by the lack of rigor, so they set about putting limits and analysis on a rm footing with
careful denitions and proofs. In this appendix we give you the formal denition and connect it 
to the intuitive idea. In 18.04 we will not need this level of formality. Still, its nice to know the 
foundations are solid, and some students may nd this interesting.</text>

The limits dont agree! The problem is that the limit depends on how  approaches 0. If we came
from other directions wed get other values. Theres nothing to do, but agree that the limit does not
exist. 
Well, there is something we can do: explore and understand limits. Lets do that now. 
2.3 Open disks, open deleted disks, open regions 
Denition. The open disk of radius  around 0 is the set of points  with   0 &lt; , i.e. all points 
within distance  of 0. 
The open deleted disk of radius  around 0 is the set of points  with 0 &lt;   0 &lt; . That is, we 
remove the center 0 from the open disk. A deleted disk is also called a punctured disk. 
z0r

Left: an open disk around 0; right: a deleted open disk around 0 
Denition. An open region in the complex plane is a set  with the property that every point in  
can be be surrounded by an open disk that lies entirely in . We will often drop the word open and 
simply call  a region. 
In the gure below, the set  on the left is an open region because for every point in  we can draw 
a little circle around the point that is completely in . (The dashed boundary line indicates that the 
boundary of  is not part of .) In contrast, the set  is not an open region. Notice the point  
shown is on the boundary, so every disk around  contains points outside  . 
Left: an open region ; right:  is not an open region 
2.4 Limits and continuous functions 
Denition. If  () is dened on a punctured disk around 0 then we say 
lim  () = 0 0 
if  () goes to 0 no matter what direction  approaches 0. 
The gure below shows several sequences of points that approach 0. If lim  () = 0 then  () 
0 
must go to 0 along each of these sequences.</text>

One way to visualize the point at  is by using a (unit) Riemann sphere and the associated stereo-
graphic projection. The gure below shows a sphere whose equator is the unit circle in the complex
plane. 
Stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane. 
Stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane is accomplished by drawing the secant line
from the north pole  through a point on the sphere and seeing where it intersects the plane. This
gives a 1-1 correspondence between a point on the sphere  and a point in the complex plane . It 
is easy to see show that the formula for stereographic projection is 
   = (, , )   = +  . 1   1   
The point  = (0, 0, 1) is special, the secant lines from  through  become tangent lines to the 
sphere at  which never intersect the plane. We consider  the point at innity. 
In the gure above, the region outside the large circle through the point  is a neighborhood of 
innity. It corresponds to the small circular cap around  on the sphere. That is, the small cap 
around  is a neighborhood of the point at innity on the sphere! 
The gure below shows another common version of stereographic projection. In this gure the 
sphere sits with its south pole at the origin. We still project using secant lines from the north pole. 
2.6 Derivatives 
The denition of the complex derivative of a complex function is similar to that of a real derivative
of a real function: For a function  () the derivative  at 0 is dened as 
 ()   (0)  (0) = lim 
0   0 
Provided, of course, that the limit exists. If the limit exists we say  is analytic at 0 or  is dier -
entiable at 0.</text>

The following is a concise list of a number of functions and their complex derivatives. None of 
the derivatives will surprise you. We also give important properties for some of the functions. The

1.  () = e = e cos() + e sin(). 
Domain = all of  ( is entire). 
 () = e. 
2.  ()   (constant) 
Domain = all of  ( is entire). 
 () = 0.

(iv) The principal branch of the function log() is continuous on the plane minus the non-positive 
real axis. Reason: the principal branch of log has 
log() = log() +  Arg(). 
So the continuity of log() follows from the continuity of Arg(). 
2.4.3 Properties of continuous functions 
Since continuity is dened in terms of limits, we have the following properties of continuous func-
tions. 
Suppose  () and  () are continuous on a region . Then 
  () + () is continuous on . 
  ()() is continuous on . 
  () () is continuous on  except (possibly) at points where () = 0. 
 If  is continuous on  () then ( ()) is continuous on . 
Using these properties we can claim continuity for each of the following functions: 
 e2 
 cos() = (e + e)2 
 If  () and () are polynomials then  ()() is continuous except at roots of (). 
2.5 The point at innity 
By denition the extended complex plane =   {}. That is, we have one point at innity to be 
thought of in a limiting sense described as follows. A sequence of points {
} goes to innity if  goes to innity. This point at innity is approached
in any direction we go. All of the sequences shown in the gure below are growing, so they all go
to the (same) point at innity. 
Various sequences all going to innity.</text>

We have found two dierent representations of  () in terms of the partials of  and . If put them 
together we have the Cauchy-Riemann equations: 
          () = +  =    = , and = .         
It turns out that the converse is true and will be very useful to us. 
Theorem. Consider the function  () = (, ) + (, ) dened on a region . If  and  satisfy 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations and have continuous partials then  () is dierentiable on . 
The proof of this is a tricky exercise in analysis. It is somewhat beyond the scope of this class, so
we will skip it. If youre interested, with a little eort you should be able to grasp it. 
2.7.3 Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations 
The Cauchy-Riemann equations provide us with a direct way of checking that a function is dieren-
tiable and computing its derivative. 
Example 2.11. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that e is dierentiable and its derivative 
is e. 
= e+ Solution: We write e = e cos() + e sin(). So 
(, ) = e cos() and (, ) = e sin().</text>

If we draw a large circle around 0 in the plane, then we call the region outside this circle a neigh-
borhood of innity. 
R
Re(z )Im(z )
The shaded region outside the circle of radius  is a neighborhood of innity. 
2.5.1 Limits involving innity 
The key idea is 1 = 0. By this we mean 
1 lim = 0 
  
We then have the following facts: 
 lim  () =   lim 1 () = 0 
0 0 
 lim  () = 0  lim  (1) = 0  0 
 lim  () =   lim1 = 0 
 0  (1) 
Example 2.6. lim e is not dened because it has dierent values if we go to innity in dierent 
 
= ee and directions, e.g. we have e 
ee lim = 0 
 
ee lim =  
+ 
lim ee is not dened, since  is constant, so ee loops in a circle indenitely. 
+ 
Example 2.7. Show lim  =  (for  a positive integer). 
 
Solution: We need to show that  gets large as  gets large. Write  = , then 
 =  =  =

2.9.2 A few proofs 
Here we prove at least some of the facts stated in the list just above. 
1.  () = e. This was done in Example 2.11 using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 
2.  ()   (constant). This case is trivial. 
3.  () =  ( an integer  0): show  () = 1 
Its probably easiest to use the denition of derivative directly. Before doing that we note the 
factorization 
   = (  0)(1 + 20+ 32
0 +  + 23 + 2 + 1) 0 0 0 0 
Now 
    ()   (0) 0  (0) = lim = lim 
0   0 0   0 
= lim (1 + 20+ 320 +  + 23 + 2 + 1) 0 0 0 0 
=  
01 . 
Since we showed directly that the derivative exists for all , the function must be entire. 
4.  () (polynomial). Since a polynomial is a sum of monomials, the formula for the derivative
follows from the derivative rule for sums and the case  () = . Likewise the fact the  () 
is entire. 
5.  () = 1. This follows from the quotient rule. 
6.  () =  ()(). This also follows from the quotient rule. 
7. sin(), cos(). All the facts about sin() and cos() follow from their denition in terms of 
exponentials. 
8. Other trig functions cot(), sec() etc. Since these are all dened in terms of cos and sin, all 
the facts about these functions follow from the derivative rules. 
9. sinh(), cosh(). All the facts about sinh() and cosh() follow from their denition in terms 
of exponentials. 
10. log(). The derivative of log() can be found by dierentiating the relation elog()=  using 
the chain rule. Let  = log(), so e =  and 
 e  e  e  1 = = 1  = 1  = 1  = e       
Using  = log() we get 
 log() 1 = .

Sequences going to 0 are mapped to sequences going to 0. 
Example 2.3. Many functions have obvious limits. For example: 
lim 2= 4 
2 
and 
lim(2 + 2)(3 + 1) = 69. 
2 
Here is an example where the limit doesnt exist because dierent sequences give dierent limits. 
Example 2.4. (No limit) Show that 
  +  lim = lim 
0  0    
does not exist. 
Solution: On the real axis we have   = = 1,   
so the limit as   0 along the real axis is 1. 
By contrast, on the imaginary axis we have 
  = = 1 ,   
so the limit as   0 along the imaginary axis is -1. Since the two limits do not agree the limit as 
  0 does not exist!

2 Analytic functions 
2.1 Introduction 
The main goal of this topic is to dene and give some of the important properties of complex analytic
functions. A function  () is analytic if it has a complex derivative  (). In general, the rules for
computing derivatives will be familiar to you from single variable calculus. However, a much richer
set of conclusions can be drawn about a complex analytic function than is generally true about real
dierentiable functions. 
2.2 The derivative: preliminaries 
In calculus we dened the derivative as a limit. In complex analysis we will do the same. 
  ( + )   ()  () = lim = lim . 
0  0  
Before giving the derivative our full attention we are going to have to spend some time exploring
and understanding limits. To motivate this well rst look at two simple examples  one positive and 
one negative. 
Example 2.1. Find the derivative of  () = 2. 
Solution: We compute using the denition of the derivative as a limit. 
( + )2  2 2+ 2 + ()2  2 
lim = lim = lim 2 +  = 2. 
0  0  0 
That was a positive example. Heres a negative one which shows that we need a careful understanding
of limits. 
Example 2.2. Let  () = . Show that the limit for  (0) does not converge. 
Solution: Lets try to compute  (0) using a limit: 
 ()   (0)      (0) = lim = lim = . 
0  0   +  
Here we used  =  + . 
Now,   0 means both  and  have to go to 0. There are lots of ways to do this. For example, 
if we let  go to 0 along the -axis then,  = 0 while  goes to 0. In this case, we would have 
 (0) = lim  = 1. 
0  
On the other hand, if we let  go to 0 along the positive -axis then 
  (0) = lim = 1 .

2.7 Cauchy-Riemann equations 
The Cauchy-Riemann equations are our rst consequence of the fact that the limit dening  () must 
be the same no matter which direction you approach  from. The Cauchy-Riemann equations will 
be one of the most important tools in our toolbox. 
2.7.1 Partial derivatives as limits 
Before getting to the Cauchy-Riemann equations we remind you about partial derivatives. If (, ) 
is a function of two variables then the partial derivatives of  are dened as 
 ( + , )  (, ) (, ) = lim ,  0  
i.e. the derivative of  holding  constant. 
 (,  + )  (, ) (, ) = lim ,  0  
i.e. the derivative of  holding  constant. 
2.7.2 The Cauchy-Riemann equations 
The Cauchy-Riemann equations use the partial derivatives of  and  to allow us to do two things: 
rst, to check if  has a complex derivative and second, to compute that derivative. We start by 
stating the equations as a theorem. 
Theorem 2.10. (Cauchy-Riemann equations) If  () = (, ) + (, ) is analytic (complex dif-
ferentiable) then 
     () = +  =       
In particular, 
  and  =   = .     
This last set of partial dierential equations is what is usually meant by the Cauchy-Riemann equa-
tions. 
Here is the short form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations: 
 =  
 =  
Proof. Lets suppose that  () is dierentiable in some region  and 
 () =  ( + ) = (, ) + (, ). 
Well compute  () by approaching  rst from the horizontal direction and then from the vertical 
direction. Well use the formula 
 ( + )   ()  () = lim , 
0</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>10</slideno>
          <text>2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS 11 
Computing partial derivatives we have 
 = e cos(),  = e sin() 
 = e sin(),  = e cos() 
We see that  =  and  = , so the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satised. Thus, e is 
dierentiable and  e =  +  = e cos() + e sin() = e.  
Example 2.12. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that  () =  is not dierentiable. 
Solution:  ( + ) =   , so (, ) = , (, ) = . Taking partial derivatives 
 = 1,  = 0,  = 0,  = 1 
Since    the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satised and therefore  is not dierentiable. 
Theorem. If  () is dierentiable on a disk and  () = 0 on the disk then  () is constant. 
Proof. Since  is dierentiable and  ()  0, the Cauchy-Riemann equations show that 
(, ) = (, ) = (, ) = (, ) = 0 
We know from multivariable calculus that a function of (, ) with both partials identically zero is 
constant. Thus  and  are constant, and therefore so is  . 
2.7.4  () as a 2  2 matrix 
Recall that we could represent a complex number  +  as a 2  2 matrix 
[ ]    +   . (1)   
Now if we write  () in terms of (, ) we have 
 () =  ( + ) = (, ) + (, )   (, ) = ((, ), (, )). 
We have 
 () =  + , 
so we can represent  () as [ ]   .   
Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations we can replace  by  and  by  which gives us the 
representation [ ]    ()  ,   
i.e,  () is just the Jacobian of  (, ). 
For me, it is easier to remember the Jacobian than the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since  () is a 
complex number I can use the matrix representation in Equation 1 to remember the Cauchy-Riemann
equations!</text>

Proof. Since the functions are analytic  , and  +, are both 0. So Equation 4 shows  =  +. 
QED. 
We think of  as a small perturbation of  . 
Example 11.7. Show all 5 zeros of 5+ 3 + 1 are inside the curve 2  = 2. 
Solution: Let  () = 5 and () = 3  +1. Clearly all 5 roots of  (really one root with multiplicity 
5) are inside 2. Also clearly,  &lt; 7 &lt; 32 =   on 2. The corollary to Rouchs theorem says all 
5 roots of  +  = 5+ 3 + 1 must also be inside the curve. 
Example 11.8. Show  + 3 + 2e has one root in the left half-plane. 
Solution: Let  () =  + 3, () = 2e. Consider the contour from  to  along the -axis and 
then the left semicircle of radius  back to . That is, the contour 1+  shown below.

To apply the corollary to Rouchs theorem we need to check that (for  large)  &lt;   on 1+ . 
On 1,  = , so 
 () = 3 +   3, () = 2e = 2. 
So  &lt;   on 1. 
On ,  =  +  with  &lt; 0 and  = . So, 
 () &gt;   3 for  large , () = 2e+ = 2e &lt; 2 (since  &lt; 0). 
So  &lt;   on . 
The only zero of  is at  = 3, which lies inside the contour. 
Therefore, by the Corollary to Rouchs theorem,  +  has the same number of roots as  inside 
the contour, that is 1. Now let  go to innity and we see that  +  has only one root in the entire 
half-plane. Theorem. Fundamental theorem of algebra.

max(1, 1,  , 0). Then on  =  we have

by Blacks formula 
() () = (7) 1 + (), 
where  is called the feedback factor. We will just accept this formula. Any class or book on control 
theory will derive it for you. 
In this context () is called the open loop system function. 
Since  is a system function, we can ask if the system is stable. 
Theorem. The poles of the closed loop system function () given in Equation 7 are the zeros 
of 1 + (). 
Proof. Looking at Equation 7, there are two possible sources of poles for . 
1. The zeros of the denominator 1 + . The theorem recognizes these. 
2. The poles of . Since  is in both the numerator and denominator of  it should be clear that 
the poles cancel. We can show this formally using Laurent series. If  has a pole of order  at 0 
then ( ) 
() = 1  + 1(  0) +  0(  0) + 1(  0)+1 +  , (  0) 
where   0. So, 
( ) 1  + 1(  0) +  0(  0) +  (0) 
() = ( )  1 +  + 1(  0) +  0(  0) +  (0) 
( ) 
 + 1(  0) +  0(  0) +  
= ( ), 
(  0) +   + 1(  0) +  0(  0) +  
which is clearly analytic at 0. (At 0 it equals () = 1.) 
Example 11.13. Set the feedback factor  = 1. Assume  is real, for what values of  is the open 
loop system () = 1 stable? For what values of  is the corresponding closed loop system  +  
() stable? 
(There is no particular reason that  needs to be real in this example. But in physical systems, 
complex poles will tend to come in conjugate pairs.) 
Solution: () has one pole at  = . Thus, it is stable when the pole is in the left half-plane, i.e. 
for  &gt; 0. 
The closed loop system function is 
1( + ) 1 = () = 1 + 1( + )  +  + 1. 
This has a pole at  =   1, so its stable if  &gt; 1. The feedback loop has stabilized the unstable 
open loop systems with 1 &lt;   0. (Actually, for  = 0 the open loop is marginally stable, but it 
is fully stabilized by the closed loop.) 
Note. The algebra involved in canceling the + term in the denominators is exactly the cancellation 
that makes the poles of  removable singularities in .

Proof. Theorem 11.1 showed that

  ()  = 2(,  , ) 
So we need to show is that the integral also equals the winding number given. This is simply the 
change of variables  =  (). With this change of variables the countour  = () becomes  = 
 () and  =  ()  so 
 ()   =   = 2 Ind( , 0)   ()  
The last equality in the above equation comes from the denition of winding number. 
Note that by assumption  does not go through any zeros of  , so  =  (()) is never zero and 1 
in the integral is not a problem. 
Here is an easy corollary to the argument principle that will be useful to us later.

11 Argument Principle 
11.1 Introduction 
The argument principle (or principle of the argument) is a consequence of the residue theorem. It 
connects the winding number of a curve with the number of zeros and poles inside the curve. This 
is useful for applications (mathematical and otherwise) where we want to know the location of zeros
and poles. 
11.2 Principle of the argument 
Setup. 
 a simple closed curve, oriented in a counterclockwise direction. 
 () analytic on and inside , except for (possibly) some nite poles inside (not on)  and some zeros 
inside (not on) . 
Let 1,  ,  be the poles of  inside  . 
Let 1,  ,  be the zeros of  inside  . 
Write mult() = the multiplicity of the zero at . Likewise write mult() = the order of the pole 
at . 
We start with a theorem that will lead to the argument principle. 
Theorem 11.1. With the above setup 
(  )  ()  = 2 mult()  mult() .   () 
Proof. To prove this theorem we need to understand the poles and residues of  () (). With this 
in mind, suppose  () has a zero of order  at 0. The Taylor series for  () near 0 is 
 () = (  0)() 
where () is analytic and never 0 on a small neighborhood of 0. This implies 
 () (  0)1() + (  0) () =  () (  0)() 
  () =   0+ () 
Since () is never 0,  () () is analytic near 0. This implies that 0 is a simple pole of 
 () () and ( )  () Res , 0=  = mult(0).  ()

Likewise, if 0 is a pole of order  then the Laurent series for  () near 0 is 
 () = (  0)() 
where () is analytic and never 0 on a small neighborhood of 0. Thus, 
 () (  0)1() + (  0) () =   () (  0)() 
  () =  +   0 () 
Again we have that 0 is a simple pole of  () () and 
( )  () Res , 0 =  = mult(0).  () 
The theorem now follows immediately from the Residue Theorem: 
 ()  = 2sum of the residues   () (  ) 
= 2 mult()  mult() .

Denition. Winding number. We have an intuition for what this means. We dene it formally via 
Cauchys formula. If  is a closed curve then its winding number (or index ) about 0 is dened as

11.2.1 Mapping curves:   
One of the key notions in this topic is mapping one curve to another. That is, if  = () is a curve 
and  =  () is a function, then  =  () =  (()) is another curve. We say  maps  to  . 
We have done this frequently in the past, but it is important enough to us now, so that we will stop
here and give a few examples. This is a key concept in the argument principle and you should make
sure you are very comfortable with it. 
Example 11.2. Let () = e with 0    2 (the unit circle). Let  () = 2. Describe the curve 
 . 
Solution: Clearly  () = e2 traverses the unit circle twice as  goes from 0 to 2 . 
Example 11.3. Let () =  with  &lt;  &lt;  (the -axis). Let  () = 1( + 1). Describe the 
curve  ().</text>

On  =  we have  () = , so we have shown  &lt;   on the curve. Thus, the corollary to 
Rouchs theorem says  +  and  have the same number of zeros inside  = . Since we know 
 has exactly  zeros inside the curve the same is true for the polynomial  + . Now let  go to 
innity, weve shown that  +  has exactly  zeros in the entire plane. 
Note. The proof gives a simple bound on the size of the zeros: they are all have magnitude less than
or equal to max(1, 1,  , 0). 
11.3 Nyquist criterion for stability 
The Nyquist criterion is a graphical technique for telling whether an unstable linear time invariant
system can be stabilized using a negative feedback loop. We will look a little more closely at such
systems when we study the Laplace transform in the next topic. For this topic we will content 
ourselves with a statement of the problem with only the tiniest bit of physical context. 
Note. You have already encountered linear time invariant systems in 18.03 (or its equivalent) when
you solved constant coecient linear dierential equations. 
11.3.1 System functions 
A linear time invariant system has a system function which is a function of a complex variable. 
Typically, the complex variable is denoted by  and a capital letter is used for the system function. 
Let () be such a system function. We will make a standard assumption that () is meromorphic
with a nite number of (nite) poles. This assumption holds in many interesting cases. For example,
quite often  () is a rational function () () ( and  are polynomials). 
We will be concerned with the stability of the system. 
Denition. The system with system function () is called stable if all the poles of  are in the left 
half-plane. That is, if all the poles of  have negative real part. 
The system is called unstable if any poles are in the right half-plane, i.e. have positive real part. 
For the edge case where no poles have positive real part, but some are pure imaginary we will call
the system marginally stable. This case can be analyzed using our techniques. For our purposes it 
would require and an indented contour along the imaginary axis. If we have time we will do the 
analysis. 
 Example 11.9. Is the system with system function  () = stable? ( + 2)(2+ 4 + 5) 
Solution: The poles are 2, 2  . Since they are all in the left half-plane, the system is stable. 
 Example 11.10. Is the system with system function () = stable? (2  4)(2+ 4 + 5) 
Solution: The poles are 2, 2  . Since one pole is in the right half-plane, the system is unstable. 
 Example 11.11. Is the system with system function () = stable? ( + 2)(2 + 4) 
Solution: The poles are 2, 2. There are no poles in the right half-plane. Since there are poles on
the imaginary axis, the system is marginally stable. 
Terminology. So far, we have been careful to say the system with system function (). From 
now on we will allow ourselves to be a little more casual and say the system (). It is perfectly</text>

clear and rolls o the tongue a little easier! 
11.3.2 Pole-zero diagrams 
We can visualize () using a pole-zero diagram. This is a diagram in the -plane where we put a 
small cross at each pole and a small circle at each zero. 
Example 11.12. Give zero-pole diagrams for each of the systems 
   1() = , 2() = , 3() = ( + 2)(2+ 4 + 5) (2  4)(2+ 4 + 5) ( + 2)(2 + 4) 
Solution: These are the same systems as in the examples just above. We rst note that they all have
a single zero at the origin. So we put a circle at the origin and a cross at each pole.

11.3.3 A bit about stability 
This is just to give you a little physical orientation. Given our denition of stability above, we could,
in principle, discuss stability without the slightest idea what it means for physical systems. 
The poles of () correspond to what are called modes of the system. A simple pole at 1 corresponds 
to a mode 1() = e1. The system is stable if the modes all decay to 0, i.e. if the poles are all in the 
left half-plane. 
Physically the modes tell us the behavior of the system when the input signal is 0, but there are
initial conditions. A pole with positive real part would correspond to a mode that goes to innity as 
 grows. It is certainly reasonable to call a system that does this in response to a zero signal (often
called no input) unstable. 
To connect this to 18.03: if the system is modeled by a dierential equation, the modes correspond
to the homogeneous solutions () = e, where  is a root of the characteristic equation. In 18.03 we
called the system stable if every homogeneous solution decayed to 0. That is, if the unforced system
always settled down to equilibrium. 
11.3.4 Closed loop systems 
If the system with system function () is unstable it can sometimes be stabilized by what is called a 
negative feedback loop. The new system is called a closed loop system. Its system function is given</text>

Proof. Applying the argument principle in Equation 2 to the function 1 +  (), we get 
(1 +  )() 
 1 +  ()  = 2 Ind(1 +  , 0) = 2(1+ ,  1+ , ) 
Now, we can compare each of the terms in this equation to those in Equation 3:

curves.

2. 2 = circle of radius 1/2. 
3. 3 = circle of radius 1. 
answers.  () has zeros at 0, 1. It has no poles. 
So,  has no poles and two zeros inside 1. The argument principle says Ind( 1, 0) = ,1 
 , = 2 
Likewise  has no poles and one zero inside 2, so Ind( 2, 0) = 1  0 = 1 
For 3 a zero of  is on the curve, i.e.  (1) = 0, so the argument principle doesnt apply. The

Solution: () has a pole in the right half-plane, so the open loop system is not stable. The closed
loop system function is 
 ( + 1)(  1)  + 1 = = () = 1 +  1 + 2( + 1)(  1) 3 + 1. 
The only pole is at  = 13 , so the closed loop system is stable. This is a case where feedback 
stabilized an unstable system. 
  1 Example 11.15. () = . Is the open loop system stable? Is the closed loop system stable  + 1 
when  = 2. 
Solution: The only pole of () is in the left half-plane, so the open loop system is stable. The closed 
loop system function is 
 (  1)( + 1)   1 = = () = 1 +  1 + 2(  1)( + 1) 3  1. 
This has one pole at  = 13, so the closed loop system is unstable. This is a case where feedback
destabilized a stable system. It can happen! 
11.3.5 Nyquist plot 
For the Nyquist plot and criterion the curve  will always be the imaginary -axis. That is 
 = () = , where   &lt;  &lt; . 
For a system  () and a feedback factor , the Nyquist plot is the plot of the curve 
 = () = (). 
That is, the Nyquist plot is the image of the imaginary axis under the map  = (). 
Note. In () the variable is a greek omega and in  =  we have a double-u. 
Example 11.16. Let  () = 1 . Draw the Nyquist plot with  = 1.  + 1 
Solution: In this case () is a fractional linear transformation, so we know it maps the imaginary
axis to a circle. It is easy to check it is the circle through the origin with center  = 12. You can 
also check that it is traversed clockwise.

There are no poles of  and  on  .

Then 
Ind( , 0) = Ind(( + ), 0). 
That is, 
 ,   , =  +,   +, (4) 
Proof. In class we gave a heuristic proof involving a person walking a dog around   on a leash of 
length . Here is the analytic proof. 
The argument principle requires the function to have no zeros or poles on . So we rst show that 
this is true of  ,  + , ( + ) . The argument is goes as follows. 
Zeros: The fact that 0   &lt;   on  implies  has no zeros on . It also implies  +  has no 
zeros on , since the value of  is never big enough to cancel that of  . Since  and  +  have no 
zeros, neither does ( + ) . 
Poles: By assumption  and  have no poles on , so  +  has no poles there. Since  has no zeros 
on , ( + ) has no poles there. 
Now we can apply the argument principle to  and  +

maps  to the inside of the unit disk centered at 1. (You should draw a gure for this.) This implies 
that (( ) )  +  Ind , 0 = 0.  
 +    
Let  = . The above says Ind( , 0) = 0. So,   = 0. (We showed above that  has   
no zeros or poles on .) 
 ( + )  Now, its easy to compute that  
=  . So, using   +   
  ( + )  Ind( , 0) =   =      = 0  Ind(( + ), 0) = Ind( , 0).   +   
Now equations 5 and 6 tell us ,   , =  +,   +, , i.e. we have proved Rouchs theorem.

Nyquist plot of () = 1( + 1), with  = 1. 
Example 11.17. Take () from the previous example. Describe the Nyquist plot with gain factor

Solution: The Nyquist plot is the graph of (). The factor  = 2 will scale the circle in the 
previous example by 2. That is, the Nyquist plot is the circle through the origin with center  = 1. 
In general, the feedback factor will just scale the Nyquist plot. 
11.3.6 Nyquist criterion 
The Nyquist criterion gives a graphical method for checking the stability of the closed loop system. 
Theorem 11.18. Nyquist criterion. Suppose that () has a nite number of zeros and poles in 
the right half-plane. Also suppose that () decays to 0 as  goes to innity. Then the closed loop 
system with feedback factor  is stable if and only if the winding number of the Nyquist plot around 
 = 1 equals the number of poles of  () in the right half-plane. 
More briey, 
() is stable  Ind( , 1) = ,RHP 
Here,  is the imaginary -axis and ,RHP is the number of poles of the original open loop system 
function  () in the right half-plane. 
Proof.  is stable exactly when all its poles are in the left half-plane. Now, recall that the poles 
of  are exactly the zeros of 1 + . So, stability of  is exactly the condition that the number 
of zeros of 1 +  in the right half-plane is 0. 
Lets work with a familiar contour.

Let  = 1+ . Note that  is traversed in the clockwise direction. Choose  large enough 
that the (nite number) of poles and zeros of  in the right half-plane are all inside . Now we can 
apply Equation 3 in the corollary to the argument principle to  () and  to get 
Ind( , 1) = 1+,   ,  
(The minus sign is because of the clockwise direction of the curve.) Thus, for all large  
the system is stable  1+,  = 0  Ind( , 1) = , . 
Finally, we can let  go to innity. The assumption that () decays 0 to as  goes to  implies</text>

So the poles are the roots of 
(  0.33)2 + 1.752 + (  1) = 2+ (  0.66) + 0.332 + 1.752   
For a quadratic with positive coecients the roots both have negative real part. This happens when 
0.66 &lt;  &lt; 0.332 + 1.752  3.17. 
Example 11.23. What happens when  goes to 0. 
Solution: As  goes to 0, the Nyquist plot shrinks to a single point at the origin. In this case the 
winding number around -1 is 0 and the Nyquist criterion says the closed loop system is stable if and
only if the open loop system is stable. 
This should make sense, since with  = 0, 
 = = .  1 +  
Example 11.24. Make a system with the following zeros and poles: 
A pair of zeros at 0.6  0.75 
A pair of poles at 0.5  2.5. 
A single pole at 0.25. 
Is the corresponding closed loop system stable when  = 6? 
Solution: The answer is no,  is not stable.  has one pole in the right half plane. The mathlet 
shows the Nyquist plot winds once around  = 1 in the clockwise direction. So the winding 
number is -1, which does not equal the number of poles of  in the right half-plane. 
If we set  = 3, the closed loop system is stable. 
11.4 A bit on negative feedback 
Given Equation 7, in 18.04 we can ask if there are any poles in the right half-plane without needing
any underlying physical model. Still, its nice to have some sense of where this ts into science and
engineering. 
In a negative feedback loop the output of the system is looped back and subtracted from the input. 
Example 11.25. The heating system in my house is an example of a system stabilized by feedback.
The thermostat is the feedback mechanism. When the temperature outside (input signal) goes down
the heat turns on. Without the thermostat it would stay on and overheat my house. The thermostat
turns the heat up or down depending on whether the inside temperature (the output signal) is too low
or too high (negative feedback). 
Example 11.26. Walking or balancing on one foot are examples negative feedback systems. If you
feel yourself falling you compensate by shifting your weight or tensing your muscles to counteract
the unwanted acceleration.</text>

11.3.7 Examples using the Nyquist Plot mathlet 
The Nyquist criterion is a visual method which requires some way of producing the Nyquist plot.
For this we will use one of the MIT Mathlets (slightly modied for our purposes). 
Open the Nyquist Plot applet at 
http://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/jmoapplets/nyquist/nyquistCrit.html 
Play with the applet, read the help. 
Now refresh the browser to restore the applet to its original state. Check the Formula box. The 
formula is an easy way to read o the values of the poles and zeros of (). In its original state, 
applet should have a zero at  = 1 and poles at  = 0.33  1.75 . 
The left hand graph is the pole-zero diagram. The right hand graph is the Nyquist plot. 
Example 11.19. To get a feel for the Nyquist plot. Look at the pole diagram and use the mouse
to drag the yellow point up and down the imaginary axis. Its image under () will trace out the 
Nyquis plot. 
Notice that when the yellow dot is at either end of the axis its image on the Nyquist plot is close to
0. Example 11.20. Refresh the page, to put the zero and poles back to their original state. There are
two poles in the right half-plane, so the open loop system () is unstable. With  = 1, what is the 
winding number of the Nyquist plot around -1? Is the closed loop system stable? 
Solution: The curve winds twice around -1 in the counterclockwise direction, so the winding number 
Ind( , 1) = 2. Since the number of poles of  in the right half-plane is the same as this winding 
number, the closed loop system is stable. 
Example 11.21. With the same poles and zeros, move the  slider and determine what range of  
makes the closed loop system stable. 
Solution: When  is small the Nyquist plot has winding number 0 around -1. For these values of , 

 is unstable. As  increases, somewhere between  = 0.65 and  = 0.7 the winding number
jumps from 0 to 2 and the closed loop system becomes stable. This continues until  is between 3.10 
and 3.20, at which point the winding number becomes 1 and  becomes unstable. 
Answer: The closed loop system is stable for  (roughly) between 0.7 and 3.10. 
Example 11.22. In the previous problem could you determine analytically the range of  where 
() is stable? 
Solution: Yes! This is possible for small systems. It is more challenging for higher order systems,
but there are methods that dont require computing the poles. 
In this case, we have

2. Any line through the origin is mapped to a line through the origin. 
3. Any circle not through the origin is mapped to a circle not through the origin. 
4. Any circle through the origin is mapped to a line not through the origin. 
Now, to prove that an arbitrary fractional linear transformation maps lines and circles to lines and
circles, we factor it into a sequence of simpler transformations. 
First suppose that  = 0. So, 
 () = ( + ). 
Since this is just translation, scaling and rotating, it is clear it maps circles to circles and lines to
lines. 
Now suppose that   0. Then, 
 ( + ) +    
 +        () = = = +  +   +    +  
So,  =  () can be computed as a composition of transforms 
  1=  +   2 = 11   =  + (  )2  
We know that each of the transforms in this sequence maps lines and circles to lines and circles.
Therefore the entire sequence does also.  
10.7.3 Mapping  to  
It turns out that for two sets of three points 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3 there is a fractional linear 
transformation that takes  to  . We can construct this map as follows. 
Let (  1)(2 3) 1() = (  3)(2 1). 
Notice that 
1(1) = 0, 1(2) = 1, 1(3) = . 
Likewise let 
(  1)(2 3) 2() = (  3)(2 1). 
Notice that 
2(1) = 0, 2(2) = 1, 2(3) = . 
Now  () =  11() is the required map. 2</text>

The gure below shows three pairs of points symmetric in the unit circle:

Example 10.17. Reection in the circle of radius . Suppose  is the circle  =  and 1 is a 
point not on . Find the reection of 1 in . 
Solution: Our strategy is to map  to the unit circle, nd the reection and then map the unit circle 
back to . 
Start with the map  () =  = . Clearly  maps  to the unit circle and 
1=  (1) = 1. 
The reection of 1 is 
2 = 11= 1. 
Mapping back from the unit circle by  1 we have 
2=  1(2) = 2= 21. 
Therefore the reection of 1 is 21.</text>

Useful fact. If () is analytic then so is () = () and  () =  (). 
Proof. Use the Taylor series for  to get the Taylor series for  and then compare  () and  ().  
Using this we have 
() =1 1

For large  the second term decays much faster than the rst, so 
()  1

That is, far from  = 0, the velocity eld looks just like the velocity eld for  (), i.e. the velocity 
eld of a source at  = 2.

() = 2 
we can transform a ow from the upper half-plane to the rst quadrant

10.11 Examples of conformal maps and excercises 
As weve seen, once we have ows or harmonic functions on one region, we can use conformal maps
to map them to other regions. In this section we will oer a number of conformal maps between
various regions. By chaining these together along with scaling, rotating and shifting we can build a
large library of conformal maps. Of course there are many many others that we will not touch on. 
For convenience, in this section we will let 
   0() = .  +  
This is our standard map of taking the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
Example 10.29. Let  be the half-plane above the line

For any real , 1=  and 2 = 1 are symmetric in the unit circle. We can choose a specic  so 
that  and 1 are equidistant from , i.e. also symmetric in the line  = . It is clear geometrically 
that this can be done. Algebraically we solve the equation 
   + 1 1 =   2 2 + 1 = 0   =  + 2 1  =   2 1. 2  
  
Thus 1=  1( + 2  1) and 2=  1(  2  1) are the required points. 
Example 10.20. Show that if two circles dont intersect then there is a pair of points 1, 2 that is 
symmetric with respect to both circles. 
Solution: Using a fractional linear transformation that maps one of the circles to a line (and the other
to a circle) we can reduce the problem to that in the previous example. 
Example 10.21. Show that any two circles that dont intersect can be mapped conformally to con-
centric circles. 
Solution: Call the circles 1 and 2. Using the previous example start with a pair of points 1, 2 
which are symmetric in both circles. Next, pick a fractional linear transformation  that maps 1 to 
0 and 2 to innity. For example,   1  () = .   2 
Since  preserves symmetry 0 and  are symmetric in the circle  (1). This implies that 0 is the 
center of  (1). Likewise 0 is the center of  (2). Thus,  (1) and  (2) are concentric. 
10.9 Solving the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions 
In general, a Dirichlet problem in a region  asks you to solve a partial dierential equation in  
where the values of the solution on the boundary of  are speciced. 
Example 10.22. Find a function  harmonic on the unit disk such that 
{
1 for 0 &lt;  &lt;  (e) = 0 for  &lt;  &lt; 0 
This is a Dirichlet problem because the values of  on the boundary are specied. The partial dier -
ential equation is implied by requiring that  be harmonic, i.e. we require 2 = 0. We will solve 
this problem in due course. 
10.9.1 Harmonic functions on the upper half-plane 
Our strategy will be to solve the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the upper half-plane
and then transfer these solutions to other domains. 
Example 10.23. Find a harmonic function (, ) on the upper half-plane that satises the boundary 
condition {
1 for  &lt; 0 (, 0) = 0 for  &gt; 0</text>

10.5 Digression to harmonic functions 
Theorem 10.9. If  and  are harmonic conjugates and  =  +  has  (0)  0, then the level 
curves of  and  through 0 are orthogonal. 
Note. We proved this in an earlier topic using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Here will make an
argument involving conformal maps. 
Proof. First well examine how  maps the level curve (, ) = . Since  =  + , the image of 
the level curve is  =  + , i.e its (contained in) a vertical line in the -plane. Likewise, the level 
curve (, ) =  is mapped to the horizontal line  =  + . 
Thus, the images of the two level curves are orthogonal. Since  is conformal it preserves the angle 
between the level curves, so they must be orthogonal.

10.6 Riemann mapping theorem 
The Riemann mapping theorem is a major theorem on conformal maps. The proof is fairly technical
and we will skip it. In practice, we will write down explicit conformal maps between regions. 
Theorem 10.10. (Riemann mapping theorem ) If  is simply connected and not the whole plane, 
then there is a bijective conformal map from  to the unit disk. 
Corollary. For any two such regions there is a bijective conformal map from one to the other. We 
say they are conformally equivalent. 
10.7 Fractional linear transformations 
Denition. A fractional linear transformation is a function of the form 
 +   () = , where , , ,  are complex constants and     0  +  
These are also called Mobius transforms or bilinear transforms. We will abbreviate fractional linear 
transformation as FLT. 
Simple point. If    = 0 then  () is a constant function.</text>

In 18.04, we use parametrized curves () = () + () in the complex plane. Considered this way, 
the tangent vector is just the derivative: 
 () =  () +  (). 
It should be clear that these representations are equivalent. The vector (  ,  ) and the complex 
number  +   both represent the same displacement. Also, the length of a vector and the angle
between two vectors is the same in both representations. 
Thinking of tangent vectors to curves as complex numbers allows us to recast conformality in terms
of complex numbers. 
Theorem 10.3. If  () is conformal at 0 then there is a complex number  = e such that the 
map  multiplies tangent vectors at 0 by . Conversely, if the map  multiplies all tangent vectors 
at 0 by  = e then  is conformal at 0. 
Proof. By denition  is conformal at 0 means that there is an angle  and a scalar  &gt; 0 such 
that the map  rotates tangent vectors at 0 by  and scales them by . This is exactly the eect of 
multiplication by  = e. 
10.4 Analytic functions are conformal 
Theorem 10.4. (Operational denition of conformal) If  is analytic on the region  and  (0)  0, 
then  is conformal at 0. Furthermore, the map  multiplies tangent vectors at 0 by  (0). 
Proof. The proof is a quick computation. Suppose  = () is curve through 0 with (0) = 0. The 
curve  () is transformed by  to the curve  =  (()). By the chain rule we have 
 (()) =  ((0)) (0) =  (0) (0).  0 
The theorem now follows from Theorem 10.3. 
Example 10.5. (Basic example) Suppose  = e and consider the map  () = . Geometrically, 
this map rotates every point by  and scales it by . Therefore, it must have the same eect on all 
tangent vectors to curves. Indeed,  is analytic and  () =  is constant. 
Example 10.6. Let  () = 2. So  () = 2 . Thus the map  has a dierent aect on tangent 
vectors at dierent points 1 and 2. 
Example 10.7. (Linear approximation ) Suppose  () is analytic at  = 0. The linear approximation 
(rst two terms of the Taylor series) is 
 ()   (0) +  (0). 
If () is a curve with (0) = 0 then, near 0, 
 (())   (0) +  (0)(). 
That is, near 0,  looks like our basic example plus a shift by  (0). 
Example 10.8. The map  () =  has lots of nice geometric properties, but it is not conformal. It
preserves the length of tangent vectors and the angle between tangent vectors. The reason it isnt 
conformal is that is does not rotate tangent vectors. Instead, it reects them across the -axis. 
In other words, it reverses the orientation of a pair of vectors. Our denition of conformal maps 
requires that it preserves orientation.</text>

10 Conformal transformations 
10.1 Introduction 
In this topic we will look at the geometric notion of conformal maps. It will turn out that analytic
functions are automatically conformal. Once we have understood the general notion, we will look
at a specic family of conformal maps called fractional linear transformations and, in particular at
their geometric properties. As an application we will use fractional linear transformations to solve
the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the unit disk with specied values on the unit circle.
At the end we will return to some questions of uid ow. 
10.2 Geometric denition of conformal mappings 
We start with a somewhat hand-wavy denition: 
Informal denition. Conformal maps are functions on  that preserve the angles between curves. 
More precisely: Suppose  () is dierentiable at 0 and () is a smooth curve through 0. To be 
concrete, lets suppose (0) = 0. The function maps the point 0 to 0=  (0) and the curve  to 
 () =  (()). 
Under this map, the tangent vector  (0) at 0 is mapped to the tangent vector 
  (0) = ( )(0) 
at 0. With these notations we have the following denition. 
Denition. The function  () is conformal at 0 if there is an angle  and a scale  &gt; 0 such that 
for any smooth curve () through 0 the map  rotates the tangent vector at 0 by  and scales it by 
. That is, for any , the tangent vector ( )(0) is found by rotating  (0) by  and scaling it by 
. 
If  () is dened on a region , we say it is a conformal map on  if it is conformal at each point  
in . Note. The scale factor  and rotation angle  depends on the point , but not on any of the curves 
through . 
Example 10.1. The gure below shows a conformal map  () mapping two curves through 
0 to 
two curves through 0=  (0). The tangent vectors to each of the original curves are both rotated 
and scaled by the same amount.

To convince yourself that  satises the boundary condition test a few points: 
 At 3: all the  = 0. So, (3, 0) = 3 as required. 
 At 2: 1= 2= 0, 3= . So, (2, 0) = 3+ 2 3= 2 as required. 
 Likewise, at 1 and 0,  have the correct values. 
As before,  is harmonic because it is the real part of the analytic function 
(2 3) (1 2) (1 0) () = 3 + log(  3) + log(  2) + log(  1).    
10.9.2 Harmonic functions on the unit disk 
Lets try to solve a problem similar to the one in Example 10.22. 
Example 10.25. Find a function  harmonic on the unit disk such that 
{ 
(e) = 1 for 2 &lt;  &lt; 2 
0 for 2 &lt;  &lt; 32 
xy

iu= 1 u= 0z
Solution: Our strategy is to start with a conformal map  from the upper half-plane to the unit disk.
We can use this map to pull the problem back to the upper half-plane. We solve it there and then
push the solution back to the disk. 
Lets call the disk , the upper half-plane . Let  be the variable on  and  the variable on . 
Back in Example 10.14 we found a map from  to . The map and its inverse are 
    +   =  () = ,  =  1() =  +   + 1.

10.10.2 Examples 
Think of  () as representing ow, possibly with sources or vortices outside  = . Then () 
represents the new ow when a circular obstacle is placed in the ow. Here are a few examples. 
Example 10.26. (Uniform ow around a circle ) We know from Topic 6 that  () =  is the complex 
potential for uniform ow to the right. So, 
() =  + 2 
is the potential for uniform ow around a circle of radius  centered at the origin. 
Uniform ow around a circle 
Just because they look nice, the gure includes streamlines inside the circle. These dont interact 
with the ow outside the circle. 
Note, that as  gets large ow looks uniform. We can see this analytically because 
() = 1  22 
goes to 1 as  gets large. (Recall that the velocity eld is (, ), where  =  +  ...) 
Example 10.27. (Source ow around a circle) Here the source is at  = 2 (outside the unit circle) 
with complex potential 
 () = log( + 2). 
With the appropriate branch cut the singularities of  are also outside  = 1. So we can apply 
Milne-Thomson and obtain (1 ) 
() = log( + 2) + log + 2  
Source ow around a circle 
We know that far from the origin the ow should look the same as a ow with just a source at  = 2. 
Lets see this analytically. First we state a useful fact:</text>

Note that  is the fractional linear transformation with coecients 
[ ] [ ]     = .   0 1 
Example 10.13. (Inversion ) Let  () = 1. This is called an inversion. It turns the unit circle 
inside out. Note that  (0) =  and  () = 0. In the gure below the circle that is outside the unit 
circle in the  plane is inside the unit circle in the  plane and vice-versa. Note that the arrows on 
the curves are reversed.

1iz7!w= 1/z
The map  = 1 inverts the plane. 
Note that  is the fractional linear transformation with coecients 
[ ] [ ]   0 1 = .   1 0 
Example 10.14. Let 
    () = .  +  
We claim that this maps the -axis to the unit circle and the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
Proof. First take  real, then 
 
   2+ 1  () =  +  =  = 1. 
2+ 1 
So,  maps the -axis to the unit circle. 
Next take  =  +  with  &gt; 0, i.e.  in the upper half-plane. Clearly 
 + 1 &gt;   1, 
so 
 +  =  + ( + 1) &gt;  + (  1) =   , 
implying that 
    () =  +  &lt; 1. 
So,  maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
We will use this map frequently, so for the record we note that 
 () = 0 ,  () = 1,  (1) = ,  (0) = 1,  (1) = .</text>

10.8 Reection and symmetry 
10.8.1 Reection and symmetry in a line 
Example 10.16. Suppose we have a line  and a point 1 not on . The reection of 1 in  is the 
point 2 so that  is the perpendicular bisector to the line segment 12. Since there is exactly one 
such point 2, the reection of a point in a line is unique. 
Denition. If 2 is the reection of 1 in , we say that 1 and 2 are symmetric with respect to the 
line  . 
In the gure below the points 1 and 2 are symmetric in the -axis. The points 3 and 4 are 
symmetric in the line .

In order to dene the reection of a point in a circle we need to work a little harder. Looking back 
at the previous example we can show the following. 
Fact. If 1 and 2 are symmetric in the line , then any circle through 1 and 2 intersects  
orthogonally. 
Proof. Call the circle . Since  is the perpendicular bisector of a chord of , the center of  lies 
on  . Therefore  is a radial line, i.e. it intersects  orthogonally.

Solution: We can write down a solution explicitly as 
1 (, ) = ,  
where  is the argument of  =  + . Since we are only working on the upper half-plane we can
take any convenient branch with branch cut in the lower half-plane, say  2 &lt;  &lt; 32.

To show  is truly a solution, we have to verify two things: 
1.  satises the boundary conditions 
2.  is harmonic. 
) Both of these are straightforward. First, look at the point 2 on the positive -axis. This has argument 
 = 0, so (2, 0) = 0. Likewise arg(1) = , so (1, 0) = 1. Thus, we have shown point (1). 
To see point (2) remember that 
log() = log() + . 
So, ( 1  = Re log()  
Since it is the real part of an analytic function,  is harmonic. .

satises the boundary condition

3 2 1 (, ) = 3+ (2 3) + (1 2) + (0 1) .    
Here, the  are the angles shown in the gure. One again, we chose a branch of  that has 0 &lt;  &lt;  
for points in the upper half-plane. (For example the branch  2 &lt;  &lt; 32.)

10.7.4 Correspondence with matrices 
We can identify the transformation 
 +   () =  +  
with the matrix [ ]   .   
This identication is useful because of the following algebraic facts.
[ ] [ ]     1. If   0 then and  correspond to the same FLT.     
Proof. This follows from the obvious equality 
 +   +  = .  +   +  
[ ] [ ]     2. If  () corresponds to  = and () corresponds to  = then composition     
 () corresponds to matrix multiplication . 
Proof. The proof is just a bit of algebra. 
( )  +   (( +  )( + )) +  ( + ) +  +   () =  = =  +   (( +  )( + )) +  ( + ) +  +  [ ] [ ] [ ]      +   +   = =      +   +  
The claimed correspondence is clear from the last entries in the two lines above.
[ ]   3. If  () corresponds to  = then  has an inverse and  1() corresponds to 1 and   [ ]   also to , i.e. to 1 without the factor of 1 det().   
Proof. Since 1 =  it is clear from the previous fact that  1 corresponds to 1. Since 
[ ] 
1   1 =      
[ ]   Fact 1 implies 1 and both correspond to the same FLT, i.e. to  1.   
Example 10.15.

[ ] e 
2. The matrix e0 
 corresponds to rotation by 2 . 0

10.8.2 Reection and symmetry in a circle 
We will adapt this for our denition of reection in a circle. So that the logic ows correctly we 
need to start with the denition of symmetric pairs of points. 
Denition. Suppose  is a line or circle. A pair of points 1, 2 is called symmetric with respect to 
 if every line or circle through the two points intersects  orthogonally. 
First we state an almost trivial fact. 
Fact. Fractional linear transformations preserve symmetry. That is, if 1 and 2 are symmetric in a 
line or circle  , then, for an FLT  ,  (1) and  (2) are symmetric in  (). 
Proof. The denition of symmetry is in terms of lines and circles, and angles. Fractional linear 
transformations map lines and circles to lines and circles and, being conformal, preserve angles.  
Theorem. Suppose  is a line or circle and 1 a point not on . There is a unique point 2 such that 
the pair 1, 2 is symmetric in . 
Proof. Let  be a fractional linear transformation that maps  to a line. We know that 1=  (1) 
has a unique reection 2 in this line. Since  1 preserves symmetry, 1 and 2=  1(2) are 
symmetric in . Since 2 is the unique point symmetric to 1 the same is true for 2 vis-a-vis 1. 
This is all shown in the gure below. 
xy
z1z2=T1(w2)S

w1=T(z1)w2T(S)w=T(z)
We can now dene reection in a circle. 
Denition. The point 2 in the theorem is called the reection of 1 in . 
10.8.3 Reection in the unit circle 
Using the symmetry preserving feature of fractional linear transformations, we start with a line and
transform to the circle. Let  be the real axis and  the unit circle. We know the FLT 
    () =  +  
maps  to . We also know that the points  and  are symmetric in . Therefore 
      1=  () = and 2=  () =  +   +  
are symmetric in . Looking at the formulas, it is clear that 2 = 11. This is important enough 
that we highlight it as a theorem.

These relationships determine the boundary values of  from those we were given for . We compute: 
 1() = 1,  1() = 1 ,  1(1) = ,  1(1) = 0. 
This shows the left hand semicircle bounding  is mapped to the segment [1, 1] on the real axis. 
Likewise, the right hand semicircle maps to the two half-lines shown. (Literally, to the segment 1 
to  to 1.) 
We know how to solve the problem for a harmonic function  on  : 
( ) 1 () = 1  1 2+ 1= Re 1  1 log(  1) + 1 log( + 1) .     
Transforming this back to the disk we have 
( ) 
() =  1() = Re 1  1 log( 1()  1) + 1 log( 1() + 1) .   
If we wanted to, we could simplify this somewhat using the formula for  1. 
10.10 Flows around cylinders 
10.10.1 Milne-Thomson circle theorem 
The Milne-Thomson theorem allows us to insert a circle into a two-dimensional ow and see how 
the ow adjusts. First well state and prove the theorem. 
Theorem. (Milne-Thomson circle theorem) If  () is a complex potential with all its singularities 
outside  =  then ( ) 
2 
() =  () +   
is a complex potential with streamline on  =  and the same singularities as  in the region

Proof. First note that 2 is the reection of  in the circle  = . 
Next we need to see that  (2) is analytic for  &gt; . By assumption  () is analytic for   , 
so it can be expressed as a Taylor series 
 () = 0+ 1 + 22+  (1) 
Therefore, ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 2 
 = 0+ 1 + 2 +  (2)    
All the singularities of  are outside  = , so the Taylor series in Equation 1 converges for 
  . This means the Laurent series in Equation 2 converges for   . That is,  (2) is 
analytic for   , i.e. it introduces no singularies to () outside  = . 
The last thing to show is that  =  is a streamline for (). This follows because for  = e 
(e) =  (e) +  (e) 
is real. Therefore 
(e) = Im((e) = 0.</text>

Pairs of points  ;  symmetric in the circle of radius 2. 
Example 10.18. Find the reection of 1 in the circle of radius  centered at . 
Solution: Let  () = (  ).  maps the circle centered at  to the unit circle. The inverse map 
is 
 1() =  + . 
So, the reection of 1 is given by mapping  to  (), reecting this in the unit circle, and mapping 
back to the original geometry with  1. That is, the reection 2 is 
1   2 
1    2= + .  1  1  
We can now record the following important fact. 
Fact. (Reection of the center) For a circle  with center  the pair  ,  is symmetric with respect 
to the circle. 
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the formula for the reection of a point in a circle. For
example, the reection of  in the unit circle is 1. So, the reection of 0 is innity. 
Example 10.19. Show that if a circle and a line dont intersect then there is a pair of points 1, 2 
that is symmetric with respect to both the line and circle. 
Solution: By shifting, scaling and rotating we can nd a fractional linear transformation  that maps
the circle and line to the following conguration: The circle is mapped to the unit circle and the line
to the vertical line  =  &gt; 1.

Example 12.6. Compute 
(cos()). 
Solution: We use the formula 
e + e 
cos() = . 2 
1(  ) + 1( + )  So, 
(cos(); ) = = 2 2+ 2 . 
12.3.2 Connection to Fourier transform 
The Laplace and Fourier transforms are intimately connected. In fact, the Laplace transform is often
called the Fourier-Laplace transform. To see the connection well start with the Fourier transform 
of a function  (). 
 
() =   ()e . 
 
If we assume  () = 0 for  &lt; 0, this becomes 
 
() =   ()e . (1) 
0 
Now if  =  then the Laplace transform is 
 
( ; ) = ( ; ) =   ()e  (2) 
0 
Comparing these two equations we see that () = ( ; ). We see the transforms are basically
the same things using dierent notation at least for functions that are 0 for  &lt; 0. 
12.4 Exponential type 
The Laplace transform is dened when the integral for it converges. Functions of exponential type 
are a class of functions for which the integral converges for all  with Re() large enough. 
Denition. We say that  () has exponential type  if there exists an  such that  () &lt; e for 
all   0. 
Note. As weve dened it, the exponential type of a function is not unique. For example, a function
of exponential type 2 is clearly also of exponential type 3. Its nice, but not always necessary, to nd
the smallest exponential type for a function. 
Theorem. If  has exponential type  then ( ) converges absolutely for Re() &gt; . 
Proof. We prove absolute convergence by bounding 
 ()e.</text>

          <text>12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 11 
The (conditional) convergence of this integral follows using exactly the same argument as in the 
e example near the end of Topic 9 on the Fourier inversion formula for  () = . That is, the 
integrand is a decaying oscillation, around 0, so its integral is also a decaying oscillation around 
some limiting value. 
Now we use the contour shown below. 
Re(z)Im(z)

We will let  go to innity and use the following steps to prove Equation 14. 
1. The residue theorem guarantees that if the curve is large enough to contain  then 
( ) 
e  e 1 = e  = Res ,  . 2 123+4       
2. In a moment we will show that the integrals over 2, 3, 4 all go to 0 as   . 
3. Clearly as  goes to innity, the integral over 1 goes to the integral in Equation 14 
Putting these steps together we have 
e +e 
e = lim  =  . 
 123+4        
Except for proving the claims in step 2, this proves Equation 14. 
To verify step 2 we look at one side at a time. 
2: 2 is parametrized by  = () =  + , with     . So, 
  e e(+) e e  e 
  = . =   2       +       
Since  and  are xed, its clear this goes to 0 as  goes to innity. 
The bottom 4 is handled in exactly the same manner as the top 2. 
3: 3 is parametrized by  = () =  + , with     . So, 
 e   e(+)  e e  2e 
  =  = . =   3       +       +   +    +  
Since  and  &gt; 0 are xed, its clear this goes to 0 as  goes to innity. 
Example 12.19. Repeat the previous example with  () =  for  &gt; 0,  () = 12.</text>

This is similar to the previous example. Since  decays like 12 we can actually allow   0 
Theorem 12.20. Laplace inversion 1. Assume  is continuous and of exponential type . Then for 
 &gt;  we have + 
 () = 1  ()e . (15) 2  
As usual, this formula holds for  &gt; 0. 
Proof. The proof uses the Fourier inversion formula. We will just accept this theorem for now. 
Example 12.18 above illustrates the theorem. 
Theorem 12.21. Laplace inversion 2. Suppose  () has a nite number of poles and decays like 
1 (or faster). Dene 
 () =  
Res( ()e, ), where the sum is over all the poles . (16) 
Then ( ; ) =  () 
Proof. Proof given in class. To be added here. The basic ideas are present in the examples above,
though it requires a fairly clever choice of contours. 
The integral inversion formula in Equation 15 can be viewed as writing  () as a sum of exponen-
tials. This is extremely useful. For example, for a linear system if we know how the system responds
to input  () = e for all , then we know how it responds to any input by writing it as a sum of 
exponentials. 
12.9 Delay and feedback. 
Let  () = 0 for  &lt; 0. Fix  &gt; 0 and let () =  (  ). So, () is a delayed version of the signal 
 (). The Laplace property Equation 10 says 
 (), () = e 
where  and  are the Laplace transforms of  and  respectively. 
Now, suppose we have a system with system function (). (Again, called the open loop system.)
As before, can feed the output back through the system. But, instead of just multiplying the output
by a scalar we can delay it also. This is captured by the feedback factor e. 
The system function for the closed loop system is 
 () = 1 + e 
Note even if you start with a rational function the system function of the closed loop with delay is
not rational. Usually it has an innite number of poles. 
Example 12.22. Suppose  () = 1 ,  = 1 and  = 1 nd the poles of (). 
Solution: 
1 . () = 1 + e 
So the poles occur where e = 1, i.e. at , where  is an odd integer. There are an innite 
number of poles on the imaginary axis. 
Example 12.23. Suppose () = 1,  = 1 and  = 12 nd the poles of (). Is the closed loop 
system stable?</text>

Equation 4 gives us formulas for all derivatives of  . 
( ; ) = 2 ()   (0)   (0) (5) 
( ; ) = 3 ()  2 (0)   (0)   (0) (6) 
Proof. For Equation 5: 
( ; ) = (( ); ) = ( ; ) (0) =  ( ()   (0)) (0) = 2 () (0) (0). QED 
The proof Equation 6 is similar. Also, similar statements hold for higher order derivatives. 
Note. There is a further complication if we want to consider functions that are discontinuous at the
origin or if we want to allow  () to be a generalized function like (). In these cases  (0) is not 
dened, so our formulas are undened. The technical x is to replace 0 by 0 in the denition and 
all of the formulas for Laplace transform. You can learn more about this by taking 18.031. 
Property 3. Theorem. If  () has exponential type , then  () is an analytic function for Re() &gt;  
and 
 () =  ( (); ). (7) 
Proof. We take the derivative of  (). The absolute convergence for Re() large guarantees that we 
can interchange the order of integration and taking the derivative. 
    () =  ()e  =   ()e  = ( (); ).  0 0 
This proves Equation 7. 
Equation 7 is called the -derivative rule. We can extend it to more derivatives in : Suppose 
( ; ) =  (). Then, 
( (); ) =   () (8) 
( (); ) = (1) ()() (9) 
Equation 8 is the same as Equation 7 above. Equation 9 follows from this. 
Example 12.8. Use the s-derivative rule and the formula (1; ) = 1 to compute the Laplace 
transform of  for  a positive integer. 
Solution: Let  () = 1 and  () = ( ; ). Using the s-derivative rule we get 
1 (; ) = ( ; ) =  () = 2 
2 (2; ) = (2 ; ) = (1)2 () = 3 
! (; ) = ( ; ) = (1) () = +1 
Property 4. -shift rule. As usual, assume  () = 0 for  &lt; 0. Suppose  &gt; 0. Then, 
( (  ); ) = e () (10)</text>

          <slideno>12</slideno>
          <text>12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 13 
Solution: 
1 () = 1 + e2. 
So the poles occur where e = 2, i.e. at  log(2)+ , where  is an odd integer. Since  log(2) &lt; 
0, there are an innite number of poles in the left half-plane. With all poles in the left half-plane,
the system is stable. 
Example 12.24. Suppose () = 1,  = 1 and  = 2 nd the poles of (). Is the closed loop 
system stable? 
Solution: 
1 . () = 1 + 2e 
So the poles occur where e = 12 , i.e. at log(2)+ , where  is an odd integer. Since log(2) &gt; 0, 
there are an innite number of poles in the right half-plane. With poles in the right half-plane, the
system is not stable. 
Remark. If Re( ) is large enough we can express the system function 
1 () = 1 + e 
as a geometric series 
1  + 2 2  3 3 +  = 1  e e e 1 + e 
So, for input  (), we have output 
 () + 2e2 ()  3e3 () +  () = () () =  ()  e 
Using the shift formula Equation 10, we have 
() =  ()   (  ) + 2 (  2)  3 (  3) +  
(This is not really an innite series because  () = 0 for  &lt; 0.) If the input is bounded and  &lt; 1 
then even for large  the series is bounded. So bounded input produces bounded output this is also
what is meant by stability. On the other hand if  &gt; 1, then bounded input can lead to unbounded 
output this is instability.

Lets continue to work from this specic example. From it well be able to remind you of the general
approach to solving constant coecient dierential equations. 
Example 12.14. Suppose  () = 2+8+7. Find the exponential modes of the equation  () = 0. 
Solution: The exponential modes are solutions of the form () = e0. Using the substititution rule 
 ()e0 = 0   (0) = 0. 
That is, () = e0 is a mode exactly when 0 is a root of  (). The roots of  () are 1, 7. So the 
modal solutions are 
 7 1() = e and 2() = e . 
Example 12.15. Redo the previous example using the Laplace transform. 
Solution: For this we solve the dierential equation with arbitrary initial conditions: 
 () =   + 8 + 7 = 0; (0) = 1,  (0) = 2. 
Let  () = (; ). Applying the Laplace transform to the equation we get 
(2 ()  (0)   (0)) + 8( ()  (0)) + 7 () = 0 
Algebra: 
1+ 81+ 2 (2+ 8 + 7) ()  1 2 81= 0   = 2+ 8 + 7 
Factoring the denominator and using partial fractions, we get 
1+ 81+ 2 1+ 81+ 2    () = = = + 2+ 8 + 7 ( + 1)( + 7)  + 1  + 7. 
We are unconcerned with the exact values of  and  . Taking the Laplace inverse we get 
 + e7 () = e . 
That is, () is a linear combination of the exponential modes. 
You should notice that the denominator in the expression for  () is none other than the characteristic 
polynomial  (). 
12.7.2 The system function 
Example 12.16. With the same  () as in Example 12.12 solve the inhomogeneous DE with rest 
initial conditions:  () =  (), (0) = 0,  (0) = 0. 
Solution: Taking the Laplace transform of the equation we get 
 () () =  (). 
Therefore 1  () =  ()  () 
We cant nd () explicitly because  () isnt specied.</text>

The properties in Equations 3-10 will be used in examples below. They are also in the table at the 
end of these notes. 
12.6 Dierential equations 
Coverup method. We are going to use partial fractions and the coverup method. We will assume
you have seen partial fractions. If you dont remember them well or have never seen the coverup
method, you should read the note Partial fractions and the coverup method posted with the class 
notes. 
Example 12.9. Solve     = e2, (0) = 1,  (0) = 1 using Laplace transform. 
Solution: Call () =  . Apply the Laplace transform to the equation gives 
(2  (0)   (0))   =1 
  2 
A little bit of algebra now gives 
(2  1) =1+  + 1.   2 
So 
1  + 1 1 1  = + = + (  2)(2  1) 2 1 (  2)(2  1)   1 
Use partial fractions to write 
   1  = + + +   2   1  + 1   1. 
The coverup method gives  = 13,  = 12 ,  = 16. 
We recognize 
1 
   
as the Laplace transform of e, so 
() = e2 + e + e + e = 1e2  1e + 1e + e. 3 2 6 
Example 12.10. Solve     = 1, (0) = 0,  (0) = 0. 
Solution: The rest (zero) initial conditions are nice because they will not add any terms to the algebra.
As in the previous example we apply the Laplace transform to the entire equation. 
1 1 1    2   = , so  = = = + +  (2  1) (  1)( + 1)    1  + 1 
The coverup method gives  = 1,  = 12,  = 12. So, 
 =  + e + e = 1 + 1

12.3 Laplace transform 
Denition. The Laplace transform of a function  () is dened by the integral 
 
( ; ) =  e () , 
0 
for those  where the integral converges. Here  is allowed to take complex values. 
Important note. The Laplace transform is only concerned with  () for   0. Generally, speaking 
we can require  () = 0 for  &lt; 0. 
Standard notation. Where the notation is clear, we will use an upper case letter to indicate the 
Laplace transform, e.g, ( ; ) =  (). 
The Laplace transform we dened is sometimes called the one-sided Laplace transform. There is a 
two-sided version where the integral goes from  to . 
12.3.1 First examples 
Lets compute a few examples. We will also put these results in the Laplace transform table at the
end of these notes. 
e Example 12.3. Let  () = . Compute  () = ( ; ) directly. Give the region in the complex

(e; ) =  
ee e()  
  =  e()  = 
{     0 0 0 
1 if Re() &gt; Re()  = 
divergent otherwise 
The last formula comes from plugging  into the exponential. This is 0 if Re(  ) &lt; 0 and 
undened otherwise.

-plane where the integral converges. 
 e  
  (; ) =  e = 
{   0 0 
 if Re() &gt; 0  = 
divergent otherwise 
The last formula comes from plugging  into the exponential. This is 0 if Re( ) &lt; 0 and undened 
otherwise. Example 12.5. Let  () = . Compute  () = ( ; ) directly. Give the region in the complex

1. If  () = () for   0, then clearly  () = (). Since the Laplace transform only concerns 
  0, the functions can dier completely for  &lt; 0. 
2. Suppose  () = e and {
 () for   1 () = . 0 for  = 1. 
That is,  and  are the same except we arbitrarily assigned them dierent values at  = 1. Then, 
since the integrals wont notice the dierence at one point,  () = () = 1(  ). In this sense 
it is impossible to dene 1( ) uniquely. 
The good news is that the inverse exists as long as we consider two functions that only dier on a
negligible set of points the same. In particular, we can make the following claim. 
Theorem. Suppose  and  are continuous and  () = () for all  with Re() &gt;  for some . 
Then  () = () for   0. 
This theorem can be stated in a way that includes piecewise continuous functions. Such a statement
takes more care, which would obscure the basic point that the Laplace transform has a unique inverse
up to some, for us, trivial dierences. 
We start with a few examples that we can compute directly. 
Example 12.18. Let 
 () = e . 
So, 
1  () = .    
Show 
 () =  
Res( ()e) (13) 
+ 
 () = 1  ()e  (14) 2  
The sum is over all poles of e(  ). As usual, we only consider  &gt; 0. 
Here,  &gt; Re() and the integral means the path integral along the vertical line  = . 
Solution: Proving Equation 13 is straightforward: It is clear that 
e 
   
has only one pole which is at  = . Since, 
( )  e 
= e Res ,     
we have proved Equation 13. 
Proving Equation 14 is more involved. We should rst check the convergence of the integral. In this 
case,  =  + , so the integral is 
+ e(+) e e 1 1  ()e  =   = . 2  2   +    2   +</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 4 
The key here is that Re() &gt;  implies Re(  ) &lt; 0. So, we can write 
   
 ()e   e()  =  eRe()  0 0 0 
The last integral clearly converges when Re(  ) &lt; 0. QED 
Example 12.7. Here is a list of some functions of exponential type. 
 () = e  &lt; 2eRe()  () (exponential type Re()) 
 () = 1   () &lt; 2 = 2e0 (exponential type 0) 
 () = cos()   ()  1 (exponential type 0) 
In the above, all of the inequalities are for   0. 
For  () = , it is clear that for any  &gt; 0 there is an  depending on  such that  ()  e 
for   0. In fact, it is a simple calculus exercise to show  = 1() works. So,  () =  has 
exponential type  for any  &gt; 0. 
The same is true of . Its worth pointing out that this follows because, if  has exponential type  
and  has exponential type  then   has exponential type  + . So, if  has exponential type  then 
 has exponential type . 
12.5 Properties of Laplace transform 
We have already used the linearity of Laplace transform when we computed (cos()). Lets o-
cially record it as a property. 
Property 1. The Laplace transform is linear. That is, if  and  are constants and  and  are 
functions then 
( + ) = ( ) + ( ). (3) 
(The proof is trivial integration is linear.) 
Property 2. A key property of the Laplace transform is that, with some technical details, 
Laplace transform transforms derivatives in  to multiplication by  (plus some details). 
This is proved in the following theorem. 
Theorem. If  () has exponential type  and Laplace transform  () then 
( (); ) =  ()   (0), valid for Re() &gt; . (4) 
Proof. We prove this using integration by parts. 
  
()e  =  ()e  ( ; ) =   0+   ()e  =  (0) +  (). 
0 0 
,  ()e In the last step we used the fact that at  = = 0, which follows from the assumption 
about exponential type.</text>

But, we can make the following denitions and observations. Let () = 1 (). If we declare  
to be the input and  the output of this linear time invariant system, then () is called the system 
function. So, we have 
 () = ()   (). (12) 
The formula  =    can be phrased as 
output = system function  input. 
Note well, the roots of  () correspond to the exponential modes of the system, i.e. the poles of 
() correspond to the exponential modes. 
The system is called stable if the modes all decay to 0 as  goes to innity. That is, if all the poles 
have negative real part. 
Example 12.17. This example is to emphasize that not all system functions are of the form 1 (). 
Consider the system modeled by the dierential equation 
 () = () , 
where  and  are polynomials. Suppose we consider  to be the input and  to be the ouput. Find 
the system function. 
Solution: If we start with rest initial conditions for  and  then the Laplace transform gives 
 () () = () () or 
() () =   ()  () 
Using the formulation 
output = system function  input, 
we see that the system function is 
() () =  () . 
Note that when  () = 0 the dierential equation becomes  () = 0. If we make the assumption 
that the () () is in reduced form, i.e.  and  have no common zeros, then the modes of the 
system (which correspond to the roots of  ()) are still the poles of the system function. 
Comments. All LTI systems have system functions. They are not even all of the form () (). 
But, in the -domain, the output is always the system function times the input. If the system function
is not rational then it may have an innite number of poles. Stability is harder to characterize, but
under some reasonable assumptions the system will be stable if all the poles are in the left half-plane. 
The system function is also called the transfer function . You can think of it as describing how the 
system transfers the input to the output. 
12.8 Laplace inverse 
Up to now we have computed the inverse Laplace transform by table lookup. For example, 1(1( 
)) = e. To do this properly we should rst check that the Laplace transform has an inverse. 
We start with the bad news: Unfortunately this is not strictly true. There are many functions with
the same Laplace transform. We list some of the ways this can happen.</text>

12 Laplace transform 
12.1 Introduction 
The Laplace transform takes a function of time and transforms it to a function of a complex variable 
. Because the transform is invertible, no information is lost and it is reasonable to think of a function 
 () and its Laplace transform  () as two views of the same phenomenon. Each view has its uses
and some features of the phenomenon are easier to understand in one view or the other. 
We can use the Laplace transform to transform a linear time invariant system from the time domain
to the -domain. This leads to the system function () for the system this is the same system 
function used in the Nyquist criterion for stability. 
One important feature of the Laplace transform is that it can transform analytic problems to algebraic
problems. We will see examples of this for dierential equations. 
12.2 A brief introduction to linear time invariant systems 
Lets start by dening our terms. 
Signal. A signal is any function of time. 
System. A system is some machine or procedure that takes one signal as input does something with 
it and produces another signal as output. 
Linear system. A linear system is one that acts linearly on inputs. That is, 1() and 2() are inputs 
to the system with outputs 1() and 2() respectively, then the input 1+ 2 produces the output 
1+ 2 and, for any constant , the input 1 produces output 1. 
This is often phrased in one sentence as input 11+ 22 produces output 11+ 22, i.e. linear 
combinations of inputs produces a linear combination of the corresponding outputs. 
Time invariance. Suppose a system takes input signal  () and produces output signal (). The 
system is called time invariant if the input signal () =  (  ) produces output signal (  ). 
LTI. We will call a linear time invariant system an LTI system. 
Example 12.1. Consider the constant coecient dierential equation 
3  + 8 + 7 =  () 
This equation models a damped harmonic oscillator, say a mass on a spring with a damper, where 
 () is the force on the mass and () is its displacement from equilibrium. If we consider  to be 
the input and  the output, then this is a linear time invariant (LTI) system. 
Example 12.2. There are many variations on this theme. For example, we might have the LTI system 
3  + 8 + 7 =  (), 
where we call  () the input signal and () the output signal.

12.7 System functions and the Laplace transform 
When we introduced the Nyquist criterion for stability we stated without any justication that the
system was stable if all the poles of the system function ()were in the left half-plane. We also 
asserted that the poles corresponded to exponential modes of the system. In this section well use 
the Laplace transform to more fully develop these ideas for dierential equations. 
12.7.1 Lightning review of 18.03 
Denitions. 
 1.  = is called a dierential operator . Applied to a function  () we have  
  = .  
We read  as  applied to  . 
Example 12.11. If  () = 3+ 2 then  = 32, 2 = 6. 
2. If  () is a polynomial then  () is called a polynomial dierential operator. 
Example 12.12. Suppose  () = 2+ 8 + 7. What is  ()? Compute  () applied to  () = 
3+ 2 + 5. Compute  () applied to () = e2. 
Solution:  () = 2+ 8 + 7 . (The  in 7 is the identity operator.) To compute  () we 
compute all the terms and sum them up: 
 () = 3+ 2 + 5 
 () = 3 2+ 2 
2 () = 6  
Therefore: (2+ 8 + 7 ) = 6 + 8(32 + 2) + 7( 3+ 2 + 5) = 73 + 242 + 20 + 51. 
() = e2 
() = 2e2 
2() = 4e2 
Therefore: (2+ 8 + 7 ) = 4e2 + 8(2)e2 + 7e2 = (4 + 16 + 7)e2 =  (2)e2. 
The substitution rule is a straightforward statement about the derivatives of exponentials. 
Theorem 12.13. (Substitution rule) For a polynomial dierential operator  () we have 
 ()e =  ()e . (11) 
Proof. This is obvious. We prove it by example. Let  () = 2+ 8 + 7 . Then 
 () = 2e + 8e + 7e =  ()e = (2+ 8 + 7)e .</text>

This was clearly more work than we want to do for every limit. Fortunately, most of the time we can
apply general rules to determine a limit without resorting to epsilons! 
Remarks. 
1. In 18.04 we will be able to spot the limit of most concrete examples of sequences. The formal
denition is needed when dealing abstractly with sequences. 
2. To mathematicians  is one of the go-to symbols for a small number. The prominent and rather
eccentric mathematician Paul Erdos used to refer to children as epsilons, as in How are the
epsilons doing? 
3. The term captured by the circle is not in common usage, but it does capture what is happen-
ing. 
2.11.2 lim  () 
0 
Sometimes we need limits of the form lim  () = . Again, the intuitive meaning is clear: as  gets 
0 
close to 0 we should see  () get close to . Here is the technical denition 
Denition. Suppose  () is dened on a punctured disk 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  around 0. We say 
lim  () =  if for every  &gt; 0 there is a  such that 
0 
 ()   &lt;  whenever 0 &lt;   0 &lt;  
This says exactly that as  gets closer (within ) to 0 we have  () is close (within ) to . Since  
can be made as small as we want,  () must go to . 
Remarks. 
1. Using the punctured disk (also called a deleted neighborhood) means that  () does not have 
to be dened at 0 and, if it is then  (0) does not necessarily equal . If  (0) =  then we 
say the  is continuous at 0. 
2. Ask any mathematician to complete the phrase For every  and the odds are that they will 
respond there is a  ... 
2.11.3 Connection between limits of sequences and limits of functions 
Heres an equivalent way to dene limits of functions: the limit lim  () =  if, for every sequence 
0 
of points {} with limit 0 the sequence { ()} has limit .</text>

Remember: The limit has to exist and be the same no matter how you approach 0! 
If  is analytic at all the points in an open region  then we say  is analytic on . 
As usual with derivatives there are several alternative notations. For example, if  =  () we can 
write 
  ()   (0)    (0) = = lim = lim  0   00  0 
Example 2.8. Find the derivative of  () = 2. 
Solution: We did this above in Example 2.1. Take a look at that now. Of course,  () = 2 . 
Example 2.9. Show  () =  is not dierentiable at any point . 
Solution: We did this above in Example 2.2. Take a look at that now. 
Challenge. Use polar coordinates to show the limit in the previous example can be any value with
modulus 1 depending on the angle at which  approaches 0. 
2.6.1 Derivative rules 
It wouldnt be much fun to compute every derivative using limits. Fortunately, we have the same
dierentiation formulas as for real-valued functions. That is, assuming  and  are dierentiable we 
have: 
  Sum rule: ( () + ()) =  +   
 
  Product rule: ( ()()) =    +   
 
       
 Quotient rule: ( () ()) =  2 
  Chain rule: ( ()) =  ( ()) ()  
1  Inverse rule:  1()=   ( 1()) 
To give you the avor of these arguments well prove the product rule. 
  ()()   (0)(0) ( ()()) = lim  0   0 
( ()   (0))() +  (0)(()  (0)) = lim 
0   0 
 ()   (0) (()  (0)) = lim () +  (0) 
0   0   0 
=  (0)(0) +  (0) (0) 
Here is an important fact that you would have guessed. We will prove it in the next section. 
Theorem. If  () is dened and dierentiable on an open disk and  () = 0 on the disk then  () 
is constant.</text>

2.10 Branch cuts and function composition 
We often compose functions, i.e.  (()). In general in this case we have the chain rule to compute 
the derivative. However we need to specify the domain for  where the function is analytic. And
when branches and branch cuts are involved we need to take care. 
Example 2.14. Let  () = e2 . Since e and 2 are both entire functions, so is  () = e2 . The 
chain rule gives us 
 () = e2(2). 
Example 2.15. Let  () = e and () = 1.  () is entire and () is analytic everywhere but 0. 
So  (()) is analytic except at 0 and 
 (()) 1  1 =  (()) () = e  2 . 
Example 2.16. Let () = 1(e  1). Clearly  is entire except where the denominator is 0. The 
denominator is 0 when e  1 = 0. That is, when  = 2 for any integer . Thus, () is analytic 
on the set 
  {2, where  is any integer } 
The quotient rule gives  () = e(e  1)2. A little more formally: () =  (()). where 
 () = 1 and  = () = e  1. We know that () is entire and  () is analytic everywhere 
except  = 0. Therefore,  (()) is analytic everywhere except where  () = 0. 
Example 2.17. It can happen that the derivative has a larger domain where it is analytic than the
original function. The main example is  () = log(). This is analytic on  minus a branch cut. 
However 
 1 log() =   
is analytic on   {0}. The converse cant happen.
 
Example 2.18. Dene a region where 1   is analytic. 
Solution: Choosing the principal branch of argument, we have  
 is analytic on 
  {  0,  = 0}, (see gure below.) . 
So  
1   is analytic except where  = 1   is on the branch cut, i.e. where  = 1   is real and 
 0. Its easy to see that 
 = 1   is real and  0   is real and  1. 
 
So 1   is analytic on the region (see gure below) 
  {  1,  = 0} 
Note. A dierent branch choice for  
 would lead to a dierent region where  
1   is analytic.</text>

 If 2  0 then lim  () () = 12 0 
 If () is continuous and dened on a neighborhood of 1 then lim ( ()) = (1) 
0
(Note: we will give the ocial denition of continuity in the next section.) 
We wont give a proof of these properties. As a challenge, you can try to supply it using the formal
denition of limits given in the appendix. 
We can restate the denition of limit in terms of functions of (, ). To this end, lets write 
 () =  ( + ) = (, ) + (, ) 
and abbreviate 
 = (, ), 0= (0, 0), 0= 0+ 0. 
Then {
lim 0 (, ) = 0 lim  () = 0 i 
0 lim 0 (, ) = 0. 
Note. The term i stands for if and only if which is another way of saying is equivalent to. 
2.4.2 Continuous functions 
A function is continuous if it doesnt have any sudden jumps. This is the gist of the following 
denition. 
Denition. If the function  () is dened on an open disk around 0 and lim  () =  (0) then we 
0 
say  is continuous at 0. If  is dened on an open region  then the phrase  is continuous on 
 means that  is continuous at every point in . 
As usual, we can rephrase this in terms of functions of (, ): 
Fact.  () = (, ) + (, ) is continuous i (, ) and (, ) are continuous as functions of 
two variables. 
Example 2.5. (Some continuous functions)
(i) A polynomial 
 () = 0+ 1 + 22+  +  
is continuous on the entire plane. Reason: it is clear that each power ( + ) is continuous as a 
function of (, ). 
(ii) The exponential function is continuous on the entire plane. Reason: 
e = e+ = e cos() + e sin(). 
So the both the real and imaginary parts are clearly continuous as a function of (, ). 
(iii) The principal branch Arg() is continuous on the plane minus the non-positive real axis. Reason:
this is clear and is the reason we dened branch cuts for arg. We have to remove the negative real 
axis because Arg() jumps by 2 when you cross it. We also have to remove  = 0 because Arg() 
is not even dened at 0.</text>

2.8 Cauchy-Riemann all the way down 
Weve dened an analytic function as one having a complex derivative. The following theorem 
 shows that if  is analytic then so is  . Thus, there are derivatives all the way down! 
Theorem 2.13. Assume the second order partials of  and  exist and are continuous. If  () = + 
is analytic, then so is  (). 
Proof. To show this we have to prove that  () satises the Cauchy-Riemann equations. If  = + 
we know 
  = ,  = ,  =  + . 
Lets write 
  =  +  , 
so, by Cauchy-Riemann, 
 =  = ,  =  = . (2) 
We want to show that  =  and  = . We do them one at a time. 
To prove  = , we use Equation 2 to see that 
 =  and  = . 
Since  = , we have  = . 
Similarly, to show  = , we compute 
 =  and  = . 
So,  = . QED. 
Technical point. Weve assumed as many partials as we need. So far we cant guarantee that all the
partials exist. Soon we will have a theorem which says that an analytic function has derivatives of
all order. Well just assume that for now. In any case, in most examples this will be obvious. 
2.9 Gallery of functions 
In this section well look at many of the functions you know and love as functions of . For each 
one well have to do three things. 
1. Dene how to compute it. 
2. Specify a branch (if necessary) giving its range. 
3. Specify a domain (with branch cut if necessary) where it is analytic. 
4. Compute its derivative. 
Most often, we can compute the derivatives of a function using the algebraic rules like the quotient
rule. If necessary we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations or, as a last resort, even the denition
of the derivative as a limit. 
Before we start on the gallery we dene the term entire function. 
Denition. A function that is analytic at every point in the complex plane is called an entire function. 
We will see that e, , sin() are all entire functions.</text>

2.11.1 Limits of sequences 
Intuitively, we say a sequence of complex numbers 1, 2,  converges to  if for large ,  is really 
close to . To be a little more precise, if we put a small circle of radius  around  then eventually the 
sequence should stay inside the circle. Lets refer to this as the sequence being captured by the circle.
This has to be true for any circle no matter how small, though it may take longer for the sequence to
be captured by a smaller circle. 
This is illustrated in the gure below. The sequence is strung along the curve shown heading towards 
. The bigger circle of radius 2 captures the sequence by the time  = 47, the smaller circle doesnt 
capture it till  = 59. Note that 25 is inside the larger circle, but since later points are outside the
circle we dont say the sequence is captured at  = 25 
A sequence of points converging to  
Denition. The sequence 1, 2, 3,  converges to the value  if for every  &gt; 0 there is a number 
 such that    &lt;  for all  &gt;  . We write this as 
lim  = . 
 
Again, the denition just says that eventually the sequence is within  of , no matter how small you 
choose  . 
Example 2.20. Show that the sequence  = (1 + )2 has limit -1. 
Solution: This is clear because 1  0. For practice, lets phrase it in terms of epsilons: given 
 &gt; 0 we have to choose  such that 
  (1) &lt;  for all  &gt;  
One strategy is to look at  + 1 and see what  should be. We have 
1 2 1 2   (1) = 
(
 1+ )2
+ 1 
 = 
2+   &lt; 2+  
So all we have to do is pick  large enough that 
1 2 + &lt;  2   
Since this can clearly be done we have proved that   .</text>

= e log() Denition.  . 
Branch: Any branch of log(). 
Domain: Generally the domain is  minus a branch cut of log. If  is an integer  0 then  
is entire. If  is a negative integer then  is dened and analytic on   {0}. 
 
= 1 .  
12. sin1()  
Denition. sin1() =  log( + 1  2). 
The denition is chosen so that sin(sin1()) = . The derivation of the formula is as follows. 
Let  = sin1(), so  = sin(). Then, 
e  e 2  2e  1 = 0  =  e 2 
Solving the quadratic in e gives 
  2 + 42+ 4 e = =  + 1  2. 2 
Taking the log gives 
  
 = log( + 1  2)   =  log( + 1  2). 
From the denition we can compute the derivative: 
 sin1() =  1 .  1  2 
Choosing a branch is tricky because both the square root and the log require choices. We will
look at this more carefully in the future. 
For now, the following discussion and gure are for your amusement. 
Sine (likewise cosine) is not a 1-1 function, so if we want sin1() to be single-valued then we 
have to choose a region where sin() is 1-1. (This will be a branch of sin1(), i.e. a range for 
the image,) The gure below shows a domain where sin() is 1-1. The domain consists of the 
vertical strip  =  +  with 2 &lt;  &lt; 2 together with the two rays on boundary where 
  0 (shown as red lines). The gure indicates how the regions making up the domain in the 
-plane are mapped to the quadrants in the -plane.

Solution: Again, lets take  
 to be analytic on the region 
  {  0,  = 0} 
So,  () is analytic except where 1 + e is real and  0. That is, except where e is real and  1. 
Now, e = ee is real only when  is a multiple of . It is negative only when  is an odd mutltiple 
of . It has magnitude greater than 1 only when  &gt; 0. Therefore  () is analytic on the region 
  {  0,  = odd multiple of }

2.11 Appendix: Limits 
The intuitive idea behind limits is relatively simple. Still, in the 19th century mathematicians were
troubled by the lack of rigor, so they set about putting limits and analysis on a rm footing with
careful denitions and proofs. In this appendix we give you the formal denition and connect it 
to the intuitive idea. In 18.04 we will not need this level of formality. Still, its nice to know the 
foundations are solid, and some students may nd this interesting.</text>

The limits dont agree! The problem is that the limit depends on how  approaches 0. If we came
from other directions wed get other values. Theres nothing to do, but agree that the limit does not
exist. 
Well, there is something we can do: explore and understand limits. Lets do that now. 
2.3 Open disks, open deleted disks, open regions 
Denition. The open disk of radius  around 0 is the set of points  with   0 &lt; , i.e. all points 
within distance  of 0. 
The open deleted disk of radius  around 0 is the set of points  with 0 &lt;   0 &lt; . That is, we 
remove the center 0 from the open disk. A deleted disk is also called a punctured disk.

Left: an open disk around 0; right: a deleted open disk around 0 
Denition. An open region in the complex plane is a set  with the property that every point in  
can be be surrounded by an open disk that lies entirely in . We will often drop the word open and 
simply call  a region. 
In the gure below, the set  on the left is an open region because for every point in  we can draw 
a little circle around the point that is completely in . (The dashed boundary line indicates that the 
boundary of  is not part of .) In contrast, the set  is not an open region. Notice the point  
shown is on the boundary, so every disk around  contains points outside  .

Denition. If  () is dened on a punctured disk around 0 then we say 
lim  () = 0 0 
if  () goes to 0 no matter what direction  approaches 0. 
The gure below shows several sequences of points that approach 0. If lim  () = 0 then  () 
0 
must go to 0 along each of these sequences.</text>

One way to visualize the point at  is by using a (unit) Riemann sphere and the associated stereo-
graphic projection. The gure below shows a sphere whose equator is the unit circle in the complex
plane. 
Stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane. 
Stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane is accomplished by drawing the secant line
from the north pole  through a point on the sphere and seeing where it intersects the plane. This
gives a 1-1 correspondence between a point on the sphere  and a point in the complex plane . It 
is easy to see show that the formula for stereographic projection is 
   = (, , )   = +  . 1   1   
The point  = (0, 0, 1) is special, the secant lines from  through  become tangent lines to the 
sphere at  which never intersect the plane. We consider  the point at innity. 
In the gure above, the region outside the large circle through the point  is a neighborhood of 
innity. It corresponds to the small circular cap around  on the sphere. That is, the small cap 
around  is a neighborhood of the point at innity on the sphere! 
The gure below shows another common version of stereographic projection. In this gure the 
sphere sits with its south pole at the origin. We still project using secant lines from the north pole. 
2.6 Derivatives 
The denition of the complex derivative of a complex function is similar to that of a real derivative
of a real function: For a function  () the derivative  at 0 is dened as 
 ()   (0)  (0) = lim 
0   0 
Provided, of course, that the limit exists. If the limit exists we say  is analytic at 0 or  is dier -
entiable at 0.</text>

2.9.1 Gallery of functions, derivatives and properties 
The following is a concise list of a number of functions and their complex derivatives. None of 
the derivatives will surprise you. We also give important properties for some of the functions. The 
proofs for each follow below. 
1.  () = e = e cos() + e sin(). 
Domain = all of  ( is entire). 
 () = e. 
2.  ()   (constant) 
Domain = all of  ( is entire). 
 () = 0. 
3.  () =  ( an integer  0) 
Domain = all of  ( is entire). 
 () = 1 . 
4.  () (polynomial) 
A polynomial has the form  () =  + 11 +  + 0. 
Domain = all of  ( () is entire). 
 () = 1 + (  1)11 +  + 2 2 + 1. 
5.  () = 1 
Domain =   {0} (the punctured plane ). 
 () = 12 . 
6.  () =  ()() (rational function). 
When  and  are polynomials  ()() is called a rational function. 
If we assume that  and  have no common roots, then: 
Domain =   {roots of } 
       
 () = . 2 
7. sin(), cos() 
e + e e  e 
Denition. cos() = , sin() = 2 2 
(By Eulers formula we know this is consistent with cos() and sin() when  =  is real.) 
Domain: these functions are entire. 
 cos() =  sin(),   sin() = cos().  
Other key properties of sin and cos:</text>

(iv) The principal branch of the function log() is continuous on the plane minus the non-positive 
real axis. Reason: the principal branch of log has 
log() = log() +  Arg(). 
So the continuity of log() follows from the continuity of Arg(). 
2.4.3 Properties of continuous functions 
Since continuity is dened in terms of limits, we have the following properties of continuous func-
tions. 
Suppose  () and  () are continuous on a region . Then 
  () + () is continuous on . 
  ()() is continuous on . 
  () () is continuous on  except (possibly) at points where () = 0. 
 If  is continuous on  () then ( ()) is continuous on . 
Using these properties we can claim continuity for each of the following functions: 
 e2 
 cos() = (e + e)2 
 If  () and () are polynomials then  ()() is continuous except at roots of (). 
2.5 The point at innity 
By denition the extended complex plane =   {}. That is, we have one point at innity to be 
thought of in a limiting sense described as follows. A sequence of points {
} goes to innity if  goes to innity. This point at innity is approached
in any direction we go. All of the sequences shown in the gure below are growing, so they all go
to the (same) point at innity. 
Various sequences all going to innity.</text>

We have found two dierent representations of  () in terms of the partials of  and . If put them 
together we have the Cauchy-Riemann equations: 
          () = +  =    = , and = .         
It turns out that the converse is true and will be very useful to us. 
Theorem. Consider the function  () = (, ) + (, ) dened on a region . If  and  satisfy 
the Cauchy-Riemann equations and have continuous partials then  () is dierentiable on . 
The proof of this is a tricky exercise in analysis. It is somewhat beyond the scope of this class, so
we will skip it. If youre interested, with a little eort you should be able to grasp it. 
2.7.3 Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations 
The Cauchy-Riemann equations provide us with a direct way of checking that a function is dieren-
tiable and computing its derivative. 
Example 2.11. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that e is dierentiable and its derivative 
is e. 
= e+ Solution: We write e = e cos() + e sin(). So 
(, ) = e cos() and (, ) = e sin().</text>

If we draw a large circle around 0 in the plane, then we call the region outside this circle a neigh-
borhood of innity. 
R
Re(z )Im(z )
The shaded region outside the circle of radius  is a neighborhood of innity. 
2.5.1 Limits involving innity 
The key idea is 1 = 0. By this we mean 
1 lim = 0 
  
We then have the following facts: 
 lim  () =   lim 1 () = 0 
0 0 
 lim  () = 0  lim  (1) = 0  0 
 lim  () =   lim1 = 0 
 0  (1) 
Example 2.6. lim e is not dened because it has dierent values if we go to innity in dierent 
 
= ee and directions, e.g. we have e 
ee lim = 0 
 
ee lim =  
+ 
lim ee is not dened, since  is constant, so ee loops in a circle indenitely. 
+ 
Example 2.7. Show lim  =  (for  a positive integer). 
 
Solution: We need to show that  gets large as  gets large. Write  = , then 
 =  =  =

2.9.2 A few proofs 
Here we prove at least some of the facts stated in the list just above. 
1.  () = e. This was done in Example 2.11 using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 
2.  ()   (constant). This case is trivial. 
3.  () =  ( an integer  0): show  () = 1 
Its probably easiest to use the denition of derivative directly. Before doing that we note the 
factorization 
   = (  0)(1 + 20+ 32
0 +  + 23 + 2 + 1) 0 0 0 0 
Now 
    ()   (0) 0  (0) = lim = lim 
0   0 0   0 
= lim (1 + 20+ 320 +  + 23 + 2 + 1) 0 0 0 0 
=  
01 . 
Since we showed directly that the derivative exists for all , the function must be entire. 
4.  () (polynomial). Since a polynomial is a sum of monomials, the formula for the derivative
follows from the derivative rule for sums and the case  () = . Likewise the fact the  () 
is entire. 
5.  () = 1. This follows from the quotient rule. 
6.  () =  ()(). This also follows from the quotient rule. 
7. sin(), cos(). All the facts about sin() and cos() follow from their denition in terms of 
exponentials. 
8. Other trig functions cot(), sec() etc. Since these are all dened in terms of cos and sin, all 
the facts about these functions follow from the derivative rules. 
9. sinh(), cosh(). All the facts about sinh() and cosh() follow from their denition in terms 
of exponentials. 
10. log(). The derivative of log() can be found by dierentiating the relation elog()=  using 
the chain rule. Let  = log(), so e =  and 
 e  e  e  1 = = 1  = 1  = 1  = e       
Using  = log() we get 
 log() 1 = .   
11.  (any complex ). The derivative for this follows from the formula 
= e log()  
= e log()    
  = = 1</text>

Sequences going to 0 are mapped to sequences going to 0. 
Example 2.3. Many functions have obvious limits. For example: 
lim 2= 4 
2 
and 
lim(2 + 2)(3 + 1) = 69. 
2 
Here is an example where the limit doesnt exist because dierent sequences give dierent limits. 
Example 2.4. (No limit) Show that 
  +  lim = lim 
0  0    
does not exist. 
Solution: On the real axis we have   = = 1,   
so the limit as   0 along the real axis is 1. 
By contrast, on the imaginary axis we have 
  = = 1 ,   
so the limit as   0 along the imaginary axis is -1. Since the two limits do not agree the limit as 
  0 does not exist! 
2.4.1 Properties of limits 
We have the usual properties of limits. Suppose 
lim  () = 1 and lim () = 2 0 0 
then 
 lim  () + () = 1+ 2.

2 Analytic functions 
2.1 Introduction 
The main goal of this topic is to dene and give some of the important properties of complex analytic
functions. A function  () is analytic if it has a complex derivative  (). In general, the rules for
computing derivatives will be familiar to you from single variable calculus. However, a much richer
set of conclusions can be drawn about a complex analytic function than is generally true about real
dierentiable functions. 
2.2 The derivative: preliminaries 
In calculus we dened the derivative as a limit. In complex analysis we will do the same. 
  ( + )   ()  () = lim = lim . 
0  0  
Before giving the derivative our full attention we are going to have to spend some time exploring
and understanding limits. To motivate this well rst look at two simple examples  one positive and 
one negative. 
Example 2.1. Find the derivative of  () = 2. 
Solution: We compute using the denition of the derivative as a limit. 
( + )2  2 2+ 2 + ()2  2 
lim = lim = lim 2 +  = 2. 
0  0  0 
That was a positive example. Heres a negative one which shows that we need a careful understanding
of limits. 
Example 2.2. Let  () = . Show that the limit for  (0) does not converge. 
Solution: Lets try to compute  (0) using a limit: 
 ()   (0)      (0) = lim = lim = . 
0  0   +  
Here we used  =  + . 
Now,   0 means both  and  have to go to 0. There are lots of ways to do this. For example, 
if we let  go to 0 along the -axis then,  = 0 while  goes to 0. In this case, we would have 
 (0) = lim  = 1. 
0  
On the other hand, if we let  go to 0 along the positive -axis then 
  (0) = lim = 1 .

2.7 Cauchy-Riemann equations 
The Cauchy-Riemann equations are our rst consequence of the fact that the limit dening  () must 
be the same no matter which direction you approach  from. The Cauchy-Riemann equations will 
be one of the most important tools in our toolbox. 
2.7.1 Partial derivatives as limits 
Before getting to the Cauchy-Riemann equations we remind you about partial derivatives. If (, ) 
is a function of two variables then the partial derivatives of  are dened as 
 ( + , )  (, ) (, ) = lim ,  0  
i.e. the derivative of  holding  constant. 
 (,  + )  (, ) (, ) = lim ,  0  
i.e. the derivative of  holding  constant. 
2.7.2 The Cauchy-Riemann equations 
The Cauchy-Riemann equations use the partial derivatives of  and  to allow us to do two things: 
rst, to check if  has a complex derivative and second, to compute that derivative. We start by 
stating the equations as a theorem. 
Theorem 2.10. (Cauchy-Riemann equations) If  () = (, ) + (, ) is analytic (complex dif-
ferentiable) then 
     () = +  =       
In particular, 
  and  =   = .     
This last set of partial dierential equations is what is usually meant by the Cauchy-Riemann equa-
tions. 
Here is the short form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations: 
 =  
 =  
Proof. Lets suppose that  () is dierentiable in some region  and 
 () =  ( + ) = (, ) + (, ). 
Well compute  () by approaching  rst from the horizontal direction and then from the vertical 
direction. Well use the formula 
 ( + )   ()  () = lim , 
0</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>10</slideno>
          <text>2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS 11 
Computing partial derivatives we have 
 = e cos(),  = e sin() 
 = e sin(),  = e cos() 
We see that  =  and  = , so the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satised. Thus, e is 
dierentiable and  e =  +  = e cos() + e sin() = e.  
Example 2.12. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that  () =  is not dierentiable. 
Solution:  ( + ) =   , so (, ) = , (, ) = . Taking partial derivatives 
 = 1,  = 0,  = 0,  = 1 
Since    the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satised and therefore  is not dierentiable. 
Theorem. If  () is dierentiable on a disk and  () = 0 on the disk then  () is constant. 
Proof. Since  is dierentiable and  ()  0, the Cauchy-Riemann equations show that 
(, ) = (, ) = (, ) = (, ) = 0 
We know from multivariable calculus that a function of (, ) with both partials identically zero is 
constant. Thus  and  are constant, and therefore so is  . 
2.7.4  () as a 2  2 matrix 
Recall that we could represent a complex number  +  as a 2  2 matrix 
[ ]    +   . (1)   
Now if we write  () in terms of (, ) we have 
 () =  ( + ) = (, ) + (, )   (, ) = ((, ), (, )). 
We have 
 () =  + , 
so we can represent  () as [ ]   .   
Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations we can replace  by  and  by  which gives us the 
representation [ ]    ()  ,   
i.e,  () is just the Jacobian of  (, ). 
For me, it is easier to remember the Jacobian than the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since  () is a 
complex number I can use the matrix representation in Equation 1 to remember the Cauchy-Riemann
equations!</text>

0 18.04 course introduction 
This class is an adaptation of a class originally taught by Andre Nachbin. He deserves most of 
the credit for the course design. The topic notes were written by me with many corrections and
improvements contributed by Jrn Dunkel. Of course, any responsibility for typos and errors lies
entirely with me. 
0.1 Brief course description 
Complex analysis is a beautiful, tightly integrated subject. It revolves around complex analytic func-
tions. These are functions that have a complex derivative. Unlike calculus using real variables, the
mere existence of a complex derivative has strong implications for the properties of the function. 
Complex analysis is a basic tool in many mathematical theories. By itself and through some of these
theories it also has a great many practical applications. 
There are a small number of far-reaching theorems that well explore in the rst part of the class.
Along the way, well touch on some mathematical and engineering applications of these theorems.
The last third of the class will be devoted to a deeper look at applications. 
The main theorems are Cauchys Theorem, Cauchys integral formula, and the existence of Taylor
and Laurent series. Among the applications will be harmonic functions, two dimensional uid ow,
easy methods for computing (seemingly) hard integrals, Laplace transforms, and Fourier transforms
with applications to engineering and physics. 
0.2 Topics needed from prerequisite math classes 
We will review these topics as we need them: 
 Limits 
 Power series 
 Vector elds 
 Line integrals 
 Greens theorem 
0.3 Level of mathematical rigor 
We will make careful arguments to justify our results. Though, in many places we will allow our-
selves to skip some technical details if they get in the way of understanding the main point, but we
will note what was left out.

0.4 Speed of the class 
(Borrowed from R. Rosales 18.04 OCW 1999) 
Do not be fooled by the fact things start slow. This is the kind of course where things keep on building
up continuously, with new things appearing rather often. Nothing is really very hard, but the total 
integration can be staggering - and it will sneak up on you if you do not watch it. Or, to express it in
mathematically sounding lingo, this course is "locally easy" but "globally hard". That means that if
you keep up-to-date with the homework and lectures, and read the class notes regularly, you should
not have any problems.</text>

The last curve 4 is handled similarly. 
9.6 Cauchy principal value 
First an example to motivate dening the principal value of an integral. Well actually compute the
integral in the next section. 
Example 9.10. Let 
 sin()  . =   0 
This integral is not absolutely convergent, but it is conditionally convergent. Formally, of course, 
we mean 
 sin()  = lim . 
   0 
We can proceed as in Example 9.5. First note that sin() is even, so 
1  sin()  = . 2    
Next, to avoid the problem that sin() goes to innity in both the upper and lower half-planes we 
replace the integrand by e .  
Weve changed the problem to computing 
e 
 =  .</text>

          <text>9 DEFINITE INTEGRALS USING THE RESIDUE THEOREM 8 
We can factor the denominator: 
1  () = (  )(  1). 
The poles are at , 1. One is inside the unit circle and one is outside. 
1 If  &gt; 1 then 1 is inside the unit circle and Res(, 1) = (2  1) 
1 If  &lt; 1 then  is inside the unit circle and Res(, ) = (1  2) 
We have { 2 if  &gt; 1 21  = 2 if  &lt; 1 12 
The example illustrates a general technique which we state now. 
Theorem 9.7. Suppose (, ) is a rational function with no poles on the circle 
2+ 2= 1 
then for ( ) 
1  + 1   1  () =  ,  2 2 
we have 
2  
(cos( ), sin( ))  = 2 residues of  inside  = 1. 0 
Proof. We make the same substitutions as in Example 9.6. So, 
( ) 2  + 1   1  (cos( ), sin( ))  = =1  ,  2 2  0 
The assumption about poles means that  has no poles on the contour  = 1. The residue theorem 
now implies the theorem.

converges. There is no symmetry requirement, i.e. 1 and 2 are completely independent, as are 1 
and 1 etc. 
The principal value converges means

lim  +  +  +    ()  (4)

converges. Here the limit is taken over all the parameter   ,   0. This limit has symmetry, 
e.g. we replaced both 1 and 1 in Equation 3 by 1 etc. Certainly if the limits in Equation 3 converge 
then so do the limits in Equation 4. QED 
Example 9.12. Consider both 
  1 1  and p.v.  .      
The rst integral diverges since 
1 2 1 1  +   = ln(1)  ln(1) + ln(2)  ln(2).    1 2 
This clearly diverges as 1, 2   and 1, 2  0. 
On the other hand the symmetric integral 
  1 1  +   = ln()  ln() + ln()  ln() = 0 .      
This clearly converges to 0. 
We will see that the principal value occurs naturally when we integrate on semicircles around points.
We prepare for this in the next section. 
9.7 Integrals over portions of circles 
We will need the following theorem in order to combine principal value and the residue theorem.

with 0    . Then

The function  () is asymptotically comparable to 12, so the integral from 2 to  is also absolutely 
convergent. 
We can conclude that the original integral is absolutely convergent. 
Next, we use the following contour. Here we assume the big circles have radius  and the small 
ones have radius .

We use the branch cut for square root that removes the positive real axis. In this branch 
0 &lt; arg() &lt; 2 and 0 &lt; arg(  
) &lt; . 
For  (), this necessitates the branch cut that removes the rays [1, ) and (, 1] from the com-
plex plane. 
The pole at  = 0 is the only singularity of  () inside the contour. It is easy to compute that 
1 1 Res(, 0) =  = = .  1 
So, the residue theorem gives us

Now, let

 Note that () = () and  () &lt;  for large .

2 2 2  1 1 1 1 2          =    1 . 1   + 1   1 1 2   1 2 1

          <text>9 DEFINITE INTEGRALS USING THE RESIDUE THEOREM 16 
Proof. Since we take the limit as  goes to 0, we can assume  is small enough that  () has a Laurent 
expansion of the punctured disk of radius  centered at 0. That is, since the pole is simple, 
1  () = + 0+ 1(  0) +  for 0 &lt;   0  .   0 
Thus, 
  ( )  ()  =   (0+ e) e  =  1 + 0e + 12e2 +    0 0 
The 1 term gives 1. Clearly all the other terms go to 0 as   0. QED. 
If the pole is not simple the theorem doesnt hold and, in fact, the limit does not exist. 
The same proof gives a slightly more general theorem. 
Theorem 9.14. Suppose  () has a simple pole at 0. Let  be the circular arc () = 0+ e,

Clearly

Since, there are no poles of ()e in the lower half-plane, applying the residue theorem to the entire 
closed contour, we get for large 1, 2: 
( ) 
e 
()e  = 2 Res ,  = 0.  +  1+2+3+4 
Thus,  1 ()  = 0 for  &lt; 0 2  
This shows the inversion formula holds for  &lt; 0. 
Finally, we give the promised argument that the inversion integral converges. By denition 
 e 
()e  =     +    
  cos() +  sin()   cos() +  sin() =  2+ 2  
The terms without a factor of  in the numerator converge absolutely because of the 2 in the 
denominator. The terms with a factor of  in the numerator do not converge absolutely. For example, 
since  sin() 
2+ 2 
decays like 1, its integral is not absolutely convergent. However, we claim that the integral does
converge conditionally. That is, both limits 
2 0  sin()  sin() lim  and lim  
2 0 2+ 2 1 1 2+ 2 
exist and are nite. The key is that, as sin() alternates between positive and negative arches, the  function is decaying monotonically. So, in the integral, the area under each arch adds or 2+ 2 
subtracts less than the arch before. This means that as 1 (or 2) grows the total area under the
curve oscillates with a decaying amplitude around some limiting value.

The problems with this integral are caused by the pole at 0. The biggest problem is that the integral
doesnt converge! The other problem is that when we try to use our usual strategy of choosing a
closed contour we cant use one that includes  = 0 on the real axis. This is our motivation for 
dening principal value. We will come back to this example below. 
Denition. Suppose we have a function  () that is continuous on the real line except at the point 
1, then we dene the Cauchy principal value as 
 11  
p.v.   ()  = lim  ()  +   () . 
, 10    1+1 
Provided the limit converges. You should notice that the intervals around 1 and around  are 
symmetric. Of course, if the integral 
 
 ()   
converges, then so does the principal value and they give the same value. We can make the denition
more exible by including the following cases. 
1. If  () is continuous on the entire real line then we dene the principal value as 
  
p.v.   ()  = lim  ()  
    
2. If we have multiple points of discontinuity, 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt;  &lt; , then 
 11 22 33  
p.v.   ()  = lim   ()  +  +  +    () .

Here the limit is taken as    and each of the   0.

R x1r1 x1r1 x2r2 x2r2 R
Intervals of integration for principal value are symmetric around  and  
The next example shows that sometimes the principal value converges when the integral itself does
not. The opposite is never true. That is, we have the following theorem. 
 
Theorem 9.11. If  () has discontinuities at 1 &lt; 2 &lt;  &lt;  and   ()  converges then 
  
so does p.v.   () . 
 
Proof. The proof amounts to understanding the denition of convergence of integrals as limits. The
integral converges means that each of the limits

9 Denite integrals using the residue theorem 
9.1 Introduction 
In this topic well use the residue theorem to compute some real denite integrals. 
 
 ()   
The general approach is always the same 
1. Find a complex analytic function () which either equals  on the real axis or which is closely 
connected to  , e.g.  () = cos(), () = e. 
2. Pick a closed contour  that includes the part of the real axis in the integral. 
3. The contour will be made up of pieces. It should be such that we can compute  ()  over 
each of the pieces except the part on the real axis. 
4. Use the residue theorem to compute  () . 
5. Combine the previous steps to deduce the value of the integral we want. 
9.2 Integrals of functions that decay 
The theorems in this section will guide us in choosing the closed contour  described in the intro-
duction. 
The rst theorem is for functions that decay faster than 1. 
Theorem 9.1. (a) Suppose  () is dened in the upper half-plane. If there is an  &gt; 1 and  &gt; 0 
such that   () &lt;  
for  large then 
lim  ()  = 0, 
  
where  is the semicircle shown below on the left.

          <text>9 DEFINITE INTEGRALS USING THE RESIDUE THEOREM 6 
Solution: The rst thing to note is that the integrand is even, so 
1  cos()  = 2  2+ 2 . 
Also note that the square in the denominator tells us the integral is absolutely convergent. 
We have to be careful because cos() goes to innity in either half-plane, so the hypotheses of The-
orem 9.1 are not satised. The trick is to replace cos() by e, so 
e 1  =  , with  = Re(). 
 2+ 2 2 
Now let 
e 
 () = 2+ 2 . 
For  =  +  with  &gt; 0 we have 
e(+) e 
 () = 2+ 2 = 2+ 2. 
Since e &lt; 1,  () satises the hypotheses of Theorem 9.1 in the upper half-plane. Now we can
use the same contour as in the previous examples 
Re(z )Im(z )
R RCR
C1ib
We have 
lim  ()  = 0 
  
and  
 lim  ()  =   ()  = .

So, by the residue theorem

residues of  inside the contour.

as a limit using LHospitals rule

Next we break the contour into pieces. 
e  lim  = . 
, 0 1+2  
Theorem 9.2(a) implies 
e 
lim  = 0.    
Equation 5 in Theorem 9.13 tells us that 
lim 
0  ( ) 
e e 
 =  Res , 0 =    
Combining all this together we have 
e 
lim  =    = 0, 
, 0 1+2+  
 sin() so  = . Thus, looking back at Example 5, where  =  , we have  0 
1   = Im() = 2 . 2 
There is a subtlety about convergence we alluded to above. That is,  is a genuine (conditionally) 
convergent integral, but  only exists as a principal value. However since  is a convergent integral 
we know that computing the principle value as we just did is sucient to give the value of the 
convergent integral. 
9.8 Fourier transform 
Denition. The Fourier transform of a function  () is dened by 
 
() =   ()e  
 
This is often read as  -hat. 
Theorem. (Fourier inversion formula.) We can recover the original function  () with the Fourier 
inversion formula  1 ()e .  () = 2  
So, the Fourier transform converts a function of  to a function of  and the Fourier inversion con-
verts it back. Of course, everything above is dependent on the convergence of the various integrals. 
Proof. We will not give the proof here. (We may get to it later in the course.) 
Example 9.16. Let {
e for  &gt; 0  () = , 0 for  &lt; 0 
where  &gt; 0. Compute () and verify the Fourier inversion formula in this case.</text>

As in the previous example, 
lim  ()  = 0 
  
and  
lim  ()  =   ()  = .

So, by the residue theorem 
 = lim  ()  = 2  
residues of  inside the contour. 
 1+ 
The poles of  are all simple and at 
e4, e34, e54, e74. 
Only e4 and e34 are inside the contour. We compute their residues as limits using LHospitals

9.9 Solving DEs using the Fourier transform 
Let   = .  
Our goal is to see how to use the Fourier transform to solve dierential equations like 
 () =  (). 
Here  () is a polynomial operator, e.g. 
2+ 8 + 7. 
We rst note the following formula: 
 () = . (9) 
Proof. This is just integration by parts: 
 
 () =   ()e  
 
 
 ()e   =  ()(e    
 
=    ()e  
 
= () QED 
In the third line we assumed that  decays so that  () =  () = 0. 
It is a simple extension of Equation 9 to see 
(() )() =  () . 
We can now use this to solve some dierential equations. 
Example 9.17. Solve the equation 
{
e if  &gt; 0  () + 8 () + 7() =  () = 0 if  &lt; 0 
Solution: In this case, we have 
 () = 2+ 8 + 7, 
so 
 () = 2+ 8 + 7 = ( + 7)( + 1).

Using the Fourier transform of  found in Example 9.16 we have 
 1  () = =  () ( + )(7 + )(1 + ). 
Fourier inversion says that 
 1 ()e  () =  2  
As always, we want to extend   to be function of a complex variable . Lets call it  (): 
1 () = ( + )(7 + )(1 + ). 
Now we can proceed exactly as in Example 9.16. We know () &lt; 3 for some constant . 
Thus, the conditions of Theorem 9.2 are easily met. So, just as in Example 9.16, we have: 
For  &gt; 0, e is bounded in the upper half-plane, so we use the contour below on the left. 
 1 () = 1  ()e  = lim ()e  2  2 1, 2 4  
1 ()e  = lim 2 1, 2 1+2+3+4

These are all in the upper half-plane. The residues are respectively,

Again, clearly this last expression goes to 0 as 1 and 2 go to . 
The argument for 3 is essentially the same as for 1, so we leave it to the reader. 
The proof for part (b) is the same. You need to keep track of the sign in the exponentials and make 
sure it is negative.

Assume that   1. 
Solution: Notice that [0, 2] is the interval used to parametrize the unit circle as  = e. We need 
to make two substitutions:

Making these substitutions we get

This has simple poles at 
1, 1, . 
Since some of the poles are on the real axis, we will need to use an indented contour along the real
axis and use principal value to compute the integral. 
The contour is shown below. We assume each of the small indents is a semicircle with radius . The

From the previous example we have

At  = 0, the gradients are both 0 so the theorem on orthogonality doesnt apply. 
Lets look at the level curves through the origin. The level curve (really the level set) for

is the pair of lines  = . At the origin this is not a smooth curve. 
Look at the gures for 2 above. It does appear that away from the origin the level curves of  
intersect the lines where  = 0 at right angles. The same is true for the level curves of  and the lines 
where  = 0. You can see the degeneracy forming at the origin: as the level curves head towards 0 
they get pointier and more right angled. So the level curve  = 0 is more properly thought of as four 
right angles. The level curve of  = 0, not knowing which leg of  = 0 to intersect orthogonally 
takes the average and comes into the origin at 45.</text>

5.6 Orthogonality of curves 
An important property of harmonic conjugates  and  is that their level curves are orthogonal. We 
start by showing their gradients are orthogonal. 
Lemma 5.4. Let  =  +  and suppose that  () = (, ) + (, ) is analytic. Then the dot 
product of their gradients is 0, i.e. 
   = 0. 
Proof. The proof is an easy application of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 
   = (, )  (, ) =  +  =    = 0 
In the last step we used the Cauchy-Riemann equations to substitute  for  and  for .  
The lemma holds whether or not the gradients are 0. To guarantee that the level curves are smooth
the next theorem requires that  ()  0. 
Theorem. Let  =  +  and suppose that 
 () = (, ) + (, ) 
is analytic. If  ()  0 then the level curve of  through (, ) is orthogonal to the level curve  
through (, ). 
Proof. The technical requirement that  ()  0 is needed to be sure that the level curves are smooth. 
We need smoothness so that it even makes sense to ask if the curves are orthogonal. Well discuss
this below. Assuming the curves are smooth the proof of the theorem is trivial: We know from 
18.02 that the gradient  is orthogonal to the level curves of  and the same is true for  and 
the level curves of . Since, by Lemma 5.4, the gradients are orthogonal this implies the curves are 
orthogonal. 
Finally, we show that  ()  0 means the curves are smooth. First note that 
 () = (, )  (, ) = (, ) + (, ). 
Now, since  ()  0 we know that 
 = (, )  0. 
Likewise,   0. Thus, the gradients are not zero and the level curves must be smooth. 
Example 5.5. The gures below show level curves of  and  for a number of functions. In all cases, 
the level curves of  are in orange and those of  are in blue. For each case we show the level curves 
separately and then overlayed on each other.</text>

5 Introduction to harmonic functions 
5.1 Introduction 
Harmonic functions appear regularly and play a fundamental role in math, physics and engineering.
In this topic well learn the denition, some key properties and their tight connection to complex
analysis. The key connection to 18.04 is that both the real and imaginary parts of analytic functions
are harmonic. We will see that this is a simple consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. In
the next topic we will look at some applications to hydrodynamics. 
5.2 Harmonic functions 
We start by dening harmonic functions and looking at some of their properties. 
Denition 5.1. A function (, ) is called harmonic if it is twice continuously dierentiable and 
satises the following partial dierential equation: 
2 =  +  = 0. (1) 
Equation 1 is called Laplaces equation. So a function is harmonic if it satises Laplaces equation. 
The operator 2 is called the Laplacian and 2 is called the Laplacian of . 
5.3 Del notation 
Heres a quick reminder on the use of the notation . For a function (, ) and a vector eld 
(, ) = (, ), we have 
( ) 
  (i)  = ,   
(ii) grad  =  = (, ) 
(iii) curl  =    = (  ) 
(iv) div  =    =  +  
(v) div grad  =    = 2 =  +  
(vi) curl grad  =     = 0 
(vii) div curl  =      = 0.

          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>5 INTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS 4 
It is a simple matter to apply the Laplacian and see that you get 0. Well leave the algebra to you!
The statement about () follows in either exactly the same way, or by noting that the Laplacian is 
translation invariant. 
Second proof that  analytic implies  and  are harmonic. We are proving that if  =  +  is 
analytic then  and  are harmonic. So, suppose  is analytic at the point 0. This means there is a 
disk of some radius, say , around 0 where  is analytic. Cauchys formula says 
1  ()  () = , 2     
where  is the circle   0 =  and  is in the disk   0 &lt; . 
Now, since the real and imaginary parts of 1(  ) are harmonic, the same must be true of the 
integral, which is limit of linear combinations of such functions. Since the circle is nite and  is 
continuous, interchanging the order of integration and dierentiation is not a problem. 
5.5 Maximum principle and mean value property 
These are similar to the corresponding properties of analytic functions. Indeed, we deduce them 
from those corresponding properties. 
Theorem. (Mean value property) If  is a harmonic function then  satises the mean value property. 
That is, suppose  is harmonic on and inside a circle of radius  centered at 0= 0+ 0 then 
2 1 (0, 0) = (0+ e)  2 0 
Proof. Let  =  +  be an analytic function with  as its real part. The mean value property for  
says 
2 1 (0, 0) + (0, 0) =  (0) =  (0+ e)  2 0 
2 1 (0+ e) + (0+ e)  = 2 0 
Looking at the real parts of this equation proves the theorem. 
Theorem. (Maximum principle) Suppose (, ) is harmonic on a open region . 
(i) Suppose 0 is in . If  has a relative maximum or minimum at 0 then  is constant on a disk 
centered at 0. 
(ii) If  is bounded and connected and  is continuous on the boundary of  then the absolute 
maximum and absolute minimum of  occur on the boundary. 
Proof. The proof for maxima is identical to the one for the maximum modulus principle. The proof
for minima comes by looking at the maxima of . 
Note. For analytic functions we only talked about maxima because we had to use the modulus in
order to have real values. Since   =   we couldnt use the trick of turning minima into maxima 
by using a minus sign.</text>

Since  is simply connected our statement of Cauchys theorem guarantees that () has an 
antiderivative in . Well need to fuss a little to get the constant of integration exactly right.
So, pick a base point 0 in . Dene the antiderivative of () by 
 
 () =  ()  + (0, 0). 
0 
(Again, by Cauchys theorem this integral can be along any path in  from 0 to .) 
4. Show that the real part of  is . 
Lets write  =  +  . So,  () =   . By construction 
 () = () =   . 
This means the rst partials of  and  are the same, so  and  dier by at most a constant. 
However, also by construction, 
 (0) = (0, 0) = (0, 0) +  (0, 0), 
So, (0, 0) = (0, 0) (and  (0, 0) = 0). Since they agree at one point we must have 
 = , i.e. the real part of  is  as we wanted to prove. 
Important corollary.  is innitely dierentiable. 
Proof. By denition we only require a harmonic function  to have continuous second partials. Since 
the analytic  is innitely dierentiable, we have shown that so is ! 
5.3.2 Harmonic conjugates 
Denition. If  and  are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function, then we say  and  
are harmonic conjugates . 
Note. If  () =  +  is analytic then so is  () =  + . So, if  and  are harmonic conjugates 
and so are  and . 
5.4 A second proof that  and  are harmonic 
This fact is important enough that we will give a second proof using Cauchys integral formula.
One benet of this proof is that it reminds us that Cauchys integral formula can transfer a general
question on analytic functions to a question about the function 1. We start with an easy to derive 
fact. 
Fact. The real and imaginary parts of  () = 1 are harmonic away from the origin. Likewise for 
1 () =  (  ) =    
away from the point  = . 
Proof. We have 
1   =    2+ 2 2+ 2 .</text>

5.3.1 Analytic functions have harmonic pieces 
The connection between analytic and harmonic functions is very strong. In many respects it mirrors
the connection between e and sine and cosine. 
Let  =  +  and write  () = (, ) + (, ). 
Theorem 5.2. If  () = (, ) + (, ) is analytic on a region  then both  and  are harmonic 
functions on . 
Proof. This is a simple consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since  =  we have 
 = . 
Likewise,  =  implies 
 = . 
Since  =  we have 
 +  =    = 0. 
Therefore  is harmonic. We can handle  similarly.  
Note. Since we know an analytic function is innitely dierentiable we know  and  have the 
required two continuous partial derivatives. This also ensures that the mixed partials agree, i.e. 
 = . 
To complete the tight connection between analytic and harmonic functions we show that any har-
monic function is the real part of an analytic function. 
Theorem 5.3. If (, ) is harmonic on a simply connected region , then  is the real part of an 
analytic function  () = (, ) + (, ). 
Proof. This is similar to our proof that an analytic function has an antiderivative. First we come up
with a candidate for  () and then show it has the properties we need. Here are the details broken 
down into steps 1-4. 
1. Find a candidate, call it (), for  (): 
 If we had an analytic  with  =  + , then Cauchy-Riemann says that  =   . So, 
lets dene 
 =   . 
 This is our candidate for  . 
2. Show that () is analytic: 
Write  =  + , where  =  and  = . Checking the Cauchy-Riemann equations we 
have [ ] [ ]     =     
Since  is harmonic we know  = , so  = . It is clear that  = . Thus  
satises the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so it is analytic.

1. Any line not through the origin is mapped to a circle through the origin. 
2. Any line through the origin is mapped to a line through the origin. 
3. Any circle not through the origin is mapped to a circle not through the origin. 
4. Any circle through the origin is mapped to a line not through the origin. 
Now, to prove that an arbitrary fractional linear transformation maps lines and circles to lines and
circles, we factor it into a sequence of simpler transformations. 
First suppose that  = 0. So, 
 () = ( + ). 
Since this is just translation, scaling and rotating, it is clear it maps circles to circles and lines to
lines. 
Now suppose that   0. Then, 
 ( + ) +    
 +        () = = = +  +   +    +  
So,  =  () can be computed as a composition of transforms 
  1=  +   2 = 11   =  + (  )2  
We know that each of the transforms in this sequence maps lines and circles to lines and circles.
Therefore the entire sequence does also.  
10.7.3 Mapping  to  
It turns out that for two sets of three points 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3 there is a fractional linear 
transformation that takes  to  . We can construct this map as follows. 
Let (  1)(2 3) 1() = (  3)(2 1). 
Notice that 
1(1) = 0, 1(2) = 1, 1(3) = . 
Likewise let 
(  1)(2 3) 2() = (  3)(2 1). 
Notice that 
2(1) = 0, 2(2) = 1, 2(3) = . 
Now  () =  11() is the required map. 2</text>

Solution: We do this in two steps. First use the rotation 
 () = e 
to map  to the upper half-plane. Follow this with the map 0. So our map is 0 (). 
You supply the picture 
Example 10.30. Let  be the channel 0     in the -plane. Find a conformal map from  to

Solution: The map  () = e does the trick. (See the Topic 1 notes!) 
You supply the picture: horizontal lines get mapped to rays from the origin and vertical segments
in the channel get mapped to semicircles.

The calculations from 1 are all trivial. 
Notes. 
1. It is possible, but more tedious and less insightful, to arrive at this theorem by direct calcula-
tion. 
2. If  is on the unit circle then 1 = . That is,  is its own reection in the unit circle as it 
should be. 
3. The center of the circle 0 is symmetric to the point at . 
The gure below shows three pairs of points symmetric in the unit circle:

Example 10.17. Reection in the circle of radius . Suppose  is the circle  =  and 1 is a 
point not on . Find the reection of 1 in . 
Solution: Our strategy is to map  to the unit circle, nd the reection and then map the unit circle 
back to . 
Start with the map  () =  = . Clearly  maps  to the unit circle and 
1=  (1) = 1. 
The reection of 1 is 
2 = 11= 1. 
Mapping back from the unit circle by  1 we have 
2=  1(2) = 2= 21. 
Therefore the reection of 1 is 21.</text>

Useful fact. If () is analytic then so is () = () and  () =  (). 
Proof. Use the Taylor series for  to get the Taylor series for  and then compare  () and  ().  
Using this we have 
() =1 1

For large  the second term decays much faster than the rst, so 
()  1

That is, far from  = 0, the velocity eld looks just like the velocity eld for  (), i.e. the velocity 
eld of a source at  = 2.

() = 2 
we can transform a ow from the upper half-plane to the rst quadrant

10.11 Examples of conformal maps and excercises 
As weve seen, once we have ows or harmonic functions on one region, we can use conformal maps
to map them to other regions. In this section we will oer a number of conformal maps between
various regions. By chaining these together along with scaling, rotating and shifting we can build a
large library of conformal maps. Of course there are many many others that we will not touch on. 
For convenience, in this section we will let 
   0() = .  +  
This is our standard map of taking the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
Example 10.29. Let  be the half-plane above the line

For any real , 1=  and 2 = 1 are symmetric in the unit circle. We can choose a specic  so 
that  and 1 are equidistant from , i.e. also symmetric in the line  = . It is clear geometrically 
that this can be done. Algebraically we solve the equation 
   + 1 1 =   2 2 + 1 = 0   =  + 2 1  =   2 1. 2  
  
Thus 1=  1( + 2  1) and 2=  1(  2  1) are the required points. 
Example 10.20. Show that if two circles dont intersect then there is a pair of points 1, 2 that is 
symmetric with respect to both circles. 
Solution: Using a fractional linear transformation that maps one of the circles to a line (and the other
to a circle) we can reduce the problem to that in the previous example. 
Example 10.21. Show that any two circles that dont intersect can be mapped conformally to con-
centric circles. 
Solution: Call the circles 1 and 2. Using the previous example start with a pair of points 1, 2 
which are symmetric in both circles. Next, pick a fractional linear transformation  that maps 1 to 
0 and 2 to innity. For example,   1  () = .   2 
Since  preserves symmetry 0 and  are symmetric in the circle  (1). This implies that 0 is the 
center of  (1). Likewise 0 is the center of  (2). Thus,  (1) and  (2) are concentric. 
10.9 Solving the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions 
In general, a Dirichlet problem in a region  asks you to solve a partial dierential equation in  
where the values of the solution on the boundary of  are speciced. 
Example 10.22. Find a function  harmonic on the unit disk such that 
{
1 for 0 &lt;  &lt;  (e) = 0 for  &lt;  &lt; 0 
This is a Dirichlet problem because the values of  on the boundary are specied. The partial dier -
ential equation is implied by requiring that  be harmonic, i.e. we require 2 = 0. We will solve 
this problem in due course. 
10.9.1 Harmonic functions on the upper half-plane 
Our strategy will be to solve the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the upper half-plane
and then transfer these solutions to other domains. 
Example 10.23. Find a harmonic function (, ) on the upper half-plane that satises the boundary 
condition {
1 for  &lt; 0 (, 0) = 0 for  &gt; 0</text>

10.5 Digression to harmonic functions 
Theorem 10.9. If  and  are harmonic conjugates and  =  +  has  (0)  0, then the level 
curves of  and  through 0 are orthogonal. 
Note. We proved this in an earlier topic using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Here will make an
argument involving conformal maps. 
Proof. First well examine how  maps the level curve (, ) = . Since  =  + , the image of 
the level curve is  =  + , i.e its (contained in) a vertical line in the -plane. Likewise, the level 
curve (, ) =  is mapped to the horizontal line  =  + . 
Thus, the images of the two level curves are orthogonal. Since  is conformal it preserves the angle 
between the level curves, so they must be orthogonal.

10.6 Riemann mapping theorem 
The Riemann mapping theorem is a major theorem on conformal maps. The proof is fairly technical
and we will skip it. In practice, we will write down explicit conformal maps between regions. 
Theorem 10.10. (Riemann mapping theorem ) If  is simply connected and not the whole plane, 
then there is a bijective conformal map from  to the unit disk. 
Corollary. For any two such regions there is a bijective conformal map from one to the other. We 
say they are conformally equivalent. 
10.7 Fractional linear transformations 
Denition. A fractional linear transformation is a function of the form 
 +   () = , where , , ,  are complex constants and     0  +  
These are also called Mobius transforms or bilinear transforms. We will abbreviate fractional linear 
transformation as FLT. 
Simple point. If    = 0 then  () is a constant function.</text>

In 18.04, we use parametrized curves () = () + () in the complex plane. Considered this way, 
the tangent vector is just the derivative: 
 () =  () +  (). 
It should be clear that these representations are equivalent. The vector (  ,  ) and the complex 
number  +   both represent the same displacement. Also, the length of a vector and the angle
between two vectors is the same in both representations. 
Thinking of tangent vectors to curves as complex numbers allows us to recast conformality in terms
of complex numbers. 
Theorem 10.3. If  () is conformal at 0 then there is a complex number  = e such that the 
map  multiplies tangent vectors at 0 by . Conversely, if the map  multiplies all tangent vectors 
at 0 by  = e then  is conformal at 0. 
Proof. By denition  is conformal at 0 means that there is an angle  and a scalar  &gt; 0 such 
that the map  rotates tangent vectors at 0 by  and scales them by . This is exactly the eect of 
multiplication by  = e. 
10.4 Analytic functions are conformal 
Theorem 10.4. (Operational denition of conformal) If  is analytic on the region  and  (0)  0, 
then  is conformal at 0. Furthermore, the map  multiplies tangent vectors at 0 by  (0). 
Proof. The proof is a quick computation. Suppose  = () is curve through 0 with (0) = 0. The 
curve  () is transformed by  to the curve  =  (()). By the chain rule we have 
 (()) =  ((0)) (0) =  (0) (0).  0 
The theorem now follows from Theorem 10.3. 
Example 10.5. (Basic example) Suppose  = e and consider the map  () = . Geometrically, 
this map rotates every point by  and scales it by . Therefore, it must have the same eect on all 
tangent vectors to curves. Indeed,  is analytic and  () =  is constant. 
Example 10.6. Let  () = 2. So  () = 2 . Thus the map  has a dierent aect on tangent 
vectors at dierent points 1 and 2. 
Example 10.7. (Linear approximation ) Suppose  () is analytic at  = 0. The linear approximation 
(rst two terms of the Taylor series) is 
 ()   (0) +  (0). 
If () is a curve with (0) = 0 then, near 0, 
 (())   (0) +  (0)(). 
That is, near 0,  looks like our basic example plus a shift by  (0). 
Example 10.8. The map  () =  has lots of nice geometric properties, but it is not conformal. It
preserves the length of tangent vectors and the angle between tangent vectors. The reason it isnt 
conformal is that is does not rotate tangent vectors. Instead, it reects them across the -axis. 
In other words, it reverses the orientation of a pair of vectors. Our denition of conformal maps 
requires that it preserves orientation.</text>

10 Conformal transformations 
10.1 Introduction 
In this topic we will look at the geometric notion of conformal maps. It will turn out that analytic
functions are automatically conformal. Once we have understood the general notion, we will look
at a specic family of conformal maps called fractional linear transformations and, in particular at
their geometric properties. As an application we will use fractional linear transformations to solve
the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the unit disk with specied values on the unit circle.
At the end we will return to some questions of uid ow. 
10.2 Geometric denition of conformal mappings 
We start with a somewhat hand-wavy denition: 
Informal denition. Conformal maps are functions on  that preserve the angles between curves. 
More precisely: Suppose  () is dierentiable at 0 and () is a smooth curve through 0. To be 
concrete, lets suppose (0) = 0. The function maps the point 0 to 0=  (0) and the curve  to 
 () =  (()). 
Under this map, the tangent vector  (0) at 0 is mapped to the tangent vector 
  (0) = ( )(0) 
at 0. With these notations we have the following denition. 
Denition. The function  () is conformal at 0 if there is an angle  and a scale  &gt; 0 such that 
for any smooth curve () through 0 the map  rotates the tangent vector at 0 by  and scales it by 
. That is, for any , the tangent vector ( )(0) is found by rotating  (0) by  and scaling it by 
. 
If  () is dened on a region , we say it is a conformal map on  if it is conformal at each point  
in . Note. The scale factor  and rotation angle  depends on the point , but not on any of the curves 
through . 
Example 10.1. The gure below shows a conformal map  () mapping two curves through 
0 to 
two curves through 0=  (0). The tangent vectors to each of the original curves are both rotated 
and scaled by the same amount.

To convince yourself that  satises the boundary condition test a few points: 
 At 3: all the  = 0. So, (3, 0) = 3 as required. 
 At 2: 1= 2= 0, 3= . So, (2, 0) = 3+ 2 3= 2 as required. 
 Likewise, at 1 and 0,  have the correct values. 
As before,  is harmonic because it is the real part of the analytic function 
(2 3) (1 2) (1 0) () = 3 + log(  3) + log(  2) + log(  1).    
10.9.2 Harmonic functions on the unit disk 
Lets try to solve a problem similar to the one in Example 10.22. 
Example 10.25. Find a function  harmonic on the unit disk such that 
{ 
(e) = 1 for 2 &lt;  &lt; 2 
0 for 2 &lt;  &lt; 32 
xy

iu= 1 u= 0z
Solution: Our strategy is to start with a conformal map  from the upper half-plane to the unit disk.
We can use this map to pull the problem back to the upper half-plane. We solve it there and then
push the solution back to the disk. 
Lets call the disk , the upper half-plane . Let  be the variable on  and  the variable on . 
Back in Example 10.14 we found a map from  to . The map and its inverse are 
    +   =  () = ,  =  1() =  +   + 1.

10.10.2 Examples 
Think of  () as representing ow, possibly with sources or vortices outside  = . Then () 
represents the new ow when a circular obstacle is placed in the ow. Here are a few examples. 
Example 10.26. (Uniform ow around a circle ) We know from Topic 6 that  () =  is the complex 
potential for uniform ow to the right. So, 
() =  + 2 
is the potential for uniform ow around a circle of radius  centered at the origin. 
Uniform ow around a circle 
Just because they look nice, the gure includes streamlines inside the circle. These dont interact 
with the ow outside the circle. 
Note, that as  gets large ow looks uniform. We can see this analytically because 
() = 1  22 
goes to 1 as  gets large. (Recall that the velocity eld is (, ), where  =  +  ...) 
Example 10.27. (Source ow around a circle) Here the source is at  = 2 (outside the unit circle) 
with complex potential 
 () = log( + 2). 
With the appropriate branch cut the singularities of  are also outside  = 1. So we can apply 
Milne-Thomson and obtain (1 ) 
() = log( + 2) + log + 2  
Source ow around a circle 
We know that far from the origin the ow should look the same as a ow with just a source at  = 2. 
Lets see this analytically. First we state a useful fact:</text>

Note that  is the fractional linear transformation with coecients 
[ ] [ ]     = .   0 1 
Example 10.13. (Inversion ) Let  () = 1. This is called an inversion. It turns the unit circle 
inside out. Note that  (0) =  and  () = 0. In the gure below the circle that is outside the unit 
circle in the  plane is inside the unit circle in the  plane and vice-versa. Note that the arrows on 
the curves are reversed.

1iz7!w= 1/z
The map  = 1 inverts the plane. 
Note that  is the fractional linear transformation with coecients 
[ ] [ ]   0 1 = .   1 0 
Example 10.14. Let 
    () = .  +  
We claim that this maps the -axis to the unit circle and the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
Proof. First take  real, then 
 
   2+ 1  () =  +  =  = 1. 
2+ 1 
So,  maps the -axis to the unit circle. 
Next take  =  +  with  &gt; 0, i.e.  in the upper half-plane. Clearly 
 + 1 &gt;   1, 
so 
 +  =  + ( + 1) &gt;  + (  1) =   , 
implying that 
    () =  +  &lt; 1. 
So,  maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk. 
We will use this map frequently, so for the record we note that 
 () = 0 ,  () = 1,  (1) = ,  (0) = 1,  (1) = .</text>

10.8 Reection and symmetry 
10.8.1 Reection and symmetry in a line 
Example 10.16. Suppose we have a line  and a point 1 not on . The reection of 1 in  is the 
point 2 so that  is the perpendicular bisector to the line segment 12. Since there is exactly one 
such point 2, the reection of a point in a line is unique. 
Denition. If 2 is the reection of 1 in , we say that 1 and 2 are symmetric with respect to the 
line  . 
In the gure below the points 1 and 2 are symmetric in the -axis. The points 3 and 4 are 
symmetric in the line .

In order to dene the reection of a point in a circle we need to work a little harder. Looking back 
at the previous example we can show the following. 
Fact. If 1 and 2 are symmetric in the line , then any circle through 1 and 2 intersects  
orthogonally. 
Proof. Call the circle . Since  is the perpendicular bisector of a chord of , the center of  lies 
on  . Therefore  is a radial line, i.e. it intersects  orthogonally.

Solution: We can write down a solution explicitly as 
1 (, ) = ,  
where  is the argument of  =  + . Since we are only working on the upper half-plane we can
take any convenient branch with branch cut in the lower half-plane, say  2 &lt;  &lt; 32.

To show  is truly a solution, we have to verify two things: 
1.  satises the boundary conditions 
2.  is harmonic. 
) Both of these are straightforward. First, look at the point 2 on the positive -axis. This has argument 
 = 0, so (2, 0) = 0. Likewise arg(1) = , so (1, 0) = 1. Thus, we have shown point (1). 
To see point (2) remember that 
log() = log() + . 
So, ( 1  = Re log()  
Since it is the real part of an analytic function,  is harmonic. . 
Example 10.24. Suppose 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3. Find a harmonic function  on the upper half-plane that 
satises the boundary condition

3 2 1 (, ) = 3+ (2 3) + (1 2) + (0 1) .    
Here, the  are the angles shown in the gure. One again, we chose a branch of  that has 0 &lt;  &lt;  
for points in the upper half-plane. (For example the branch  2 &lt;  &lt; 32.)

10.7.4 Correspondence with matrices 
We can identify the transformation 
 +   () =  +  
with the matrix [ ]   .   
This identication is useful because of the following algebraic facts.
[ ] [ ]     1. If   0 then and  correspond to the same FLT.     
Proof. This follows from the obvious equality 
 +   +  = .  +   +  
[ ] [ ]     2. If  () corresponds to  = and () corresponds to  = then composition     
 () corresponds to matrix multiplication . 
Proof. The proof is just a bit of algebra. 
( )  +   (( +  )( + )) +  ( + ) +  +   () =  = =  +   (( +  )( + )) +  ( + ) +  +  [ ] [ ] [ ]      +   +   = =      +   +  
The claimed correspondence is clear from the last entries in the two lines above.
[ ]   3. If  () corresponds to  = then  has an inverse and  1() corresponds to 1 and   [ ]   also to , i.e. to 1 without the factor of 1 det().   
Proof. Since 1 =  it is clear from the previous fact that  1 corresponds to 1. Since 
[ ] 
1   1 =      
[ ]   Fact 1 implies 1 and both correspond to the same FLT, i.e. to  1.   
Example 10.15. 
[ ]   1. The matrix 0 1 corresponds to  () =  + . 
[ ] e 
2. The matrix e0 
 corresponds to rotation by 2 . 0 
[ ] 0 1 3. The matrix 1 0 corresponds to the inversion  = 1.</text>

10.8.2 Reection and symmetry in a circle 
We will adapt this for our denition of reection in a circle. So that the logic ows correctly we 
need to start with the denition of symmetric pairs of points. 
Denition. Suppose  is a line or circle. A pair of points 1, 2 is called symmetric with respect to 
 if every line or circle through the two points intersects  orthogonally. 
First we state an almost trivial fact. 
Fact. Fractional linear transformations preserve symmetry. That is, if 1 and 2 are symmetric in a 
line or circle  , then, for an FLT  ,  (1) and  (2) are symmetric in  (). 
Proof. The denition of symmetry is in terms of lines and circles, and angles. Fractional linear 
transformations map lines and circles to lines and circles and, being conformal, preserve angles.  
Theorem. Suppose  is a line or circle and 1 a point not on . There is a unique point 2 such that 
the pair 1, 2 is symmetric in . 
Proof. Let  be a fractional linear transformation that maps  to a line. We know that 1=  (1) 
has a unique reection 2 in this line. Since  1 preserves symmetry, 1 and 2=  1(2) are 
symmetric in . Since 2 is the unique point symmetric to 1 the same is true for 2 vis-a-vis 1. 
This is all shown in the gure below.

We can now dene reection in a circle. 
Denition. The point 2 in the theorem is called the reection of 1 in . 
10.8.3 Reection in the unit circle 
Using the symmetry preserving feature of fractional linear transformations, we start with a line and
transform to the circle. Let  be the real axis and  the unit circle. We know the FLT 
    () =  +  
maps  to . We also know that the points  and  are symmetric in . Therefore 
      1=  () = and 2=  () =  +   +  
are symmetric in . Looking at the formulas, it is clear that 2 = 11. This is important enough 
that we highlight it as a theorem. 
Theorem. (Reection in the unit circle ) The reection of  =  +  = e in the unit circle is 
e 1   +  = = = .  2 2+ 2</text>

These relationships determine the boundary values of  from those we were given for . We compute: 
 1() = 1,  1() = 1 ,  1(1) = ,  1(1) = 0. 
This shows the left hand semicircle bounding  is mapped to the segment [1, 1] on the real axis. 
Likewise, the right hand semicircle maps to the two half-lines shown. (Literally, to the segment 1 
to  to 1.) 
We know how to solve the problem for a harmonic function  on  : 
( ) 1 () = 1  1 2+ 1= Re 1  1 log(  1) + 1 log( + 1) .     
Transforming this back to the disk we have 
( ) 
() =  1() = Re 1  1 log( 1()  1) + 1 log( 1() + 1) .   
If we wanted to, we could simplify this somewhat using the formula for  1.

10.10.1 Milne-Thomson circle theorem 
The Milne-Thomson theorem allows us to insert a circle into a two-dimensional ow and see how 
the ow adjusts. First well state and prove the theorem. 
Theorem. (Milne-Thomson circle theorem) If  () is a complex potential with all its singularities 
outside  =  then ( ) 
2 
() =  () +   
is a complex potential with streamline on  =  and the same singularities as  in the region 
 &gt; . 
Proof. First note that 2 is the reection of  in the circle  = . 
Next we need to see that  (2) is analytic for  &gt; . By assumption  () is analytic for   , 
so it can be expressed as a Taylor series 
 () = 0+ 1 + 22+  (1) 
Therefore, ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 2 
 = 0+ 1 + 2 +  (2)    
All the singularities of  are outside  = , so the Taylor series in Equation 1 converges for 
  . This means the Laurent series in Equation 2 converges for   . That is,  (2) is 
analytic for   , i.e. it introduces no singularies to () outside  = . 
The last thing to show is that  =  is a streamline for (). This follows because for  = e 
(e) =  (e) +  (e) 
is real. Therefore 
(e) = Im((e) = 0.</text>

Pairs of points  ;  symmetric in the circle of radius 2. 
Example 10.18. Find the reection of 1 in the circle of radius  centered at . 
Solution: Let  () = (  ).  maps the circle centered at  to the unit circle. The inverse map 
is 
 1() =  + . 
So, the reection of 1 is given by mapping  to  (), reecting this in the unit circle, and mapping 
back to the original geometry with  1. That is, the reection 2 is 
1   2 
1    2= + .  1  1  
We can now record the following important fact. 
Fact. (Reection of the center) For a circle  with center  the pair  ,  is symmetric with respect 
to the circle. 
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the formula for the reection of a point in a circle. For
example, the reection of  in the unit circle is 1. So, the reection of 0 is innity. 
Example 10.19. Show that if a circle and a line dont intersect then there is a pair of points 1, 2 
that is symmetric with respect to both the line and circle. 
Solution: By shifting, scaling and rotating we can nd a fractional linear transformation  that maps
the circle and line to the following conguration: The circle is mapped to the unit circle and the line
to the vertical line  =  &gt; 1.
