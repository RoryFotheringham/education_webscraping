Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2009)
Ichess players and college students behave differently in the
centipede game.
IHigher-ranked chess players end the game earlier.
IAll Grandmasters in the experiment stopped at the rst opportunity.
IChess players are familiar with backward induction reasoning and
need less learning to reach the equilibrium.
IPlaying against non-chess-players, even chess players continue in
the game longer.
IIn long games, common knowledge of the ability to do complicated
inductive reasoning becomes important for the prediction.

IPlayer 1 has two piles in front of her: one contains 3 coins, the other
1.
IPlayer 1 can either take the larger pile and give the smaller one to
player 2 (T ) or push both piles across the table to player 2 (C ).
IEvery time the piles pass across the table, one coin is added to each.
IPlayers alternate in choosing whether to take the larger pile (T ) or
trust opponent with bigger piles (C ).
IThe game lasts 100 rounds.

Denition 1
Asubgame Gof an extensive form game Tconsists of a single node x
andallits successors in T, with the property that if x02Gandx002h(x0)
then x002G. The information sets, actions and payoffs in the subgame are
inherited from T.

          <text>Comments
IIn a game of complete information, every rationalizable strategy is
sensitive to common-knowledge assumptions whenever there are
multiple rationalizable strategies.
IICR does not have a proper renement that is upper-hemicontinuous
with respect to belief hierarchies.
IICR provides the only robust prediction with respect to higher order
beliefs. It characterizes the predictions that may be veried by a
researcher who can observe arbitrarily precise noisy signals about
arbitrarily high but nite orders of beliefs.

          <text>Keynesian Beauty Contest
Keynes described the action of rational actors in a market using an
analogy based on a newspaper contest. Entrants are asked to choose a
set of 6 faces from photographs that they nd most beautiful. Those who
picked the most popular face are eligible for a prize.
Anaive strategy would be to choose the 6 faces that, in the opinion of the
entrant, are most beautiful. A more sophisticated contest entrant, wishing
to maximize the chances of winning against naive opponents, would guess
which faces the majority nds attractive, and then make a selection based
on this inference.
This can be carried one step further to account for the fact that other
entrants would each have their own opinions of what public perceptions of
beauty are. What does everyone believe about what everyone else
believes about whom others nd attractive?

          <text>What is Game Theory?
Game Theory is the formal study of strategic interaction.
In a strategic setting the actions of several agents areinterdependent.
Each agents outcome depends not only on his actions, but also on the
actions of other agents. How to predict opponents play and respond
optimally?
Everything is a game. . .
Ipoker, chess, soccer, driving, dating, stock market
Iadvertising, setting prices, entering new markets, building a reputation
Ibargaining, partnerships, job market search and screening
Idesigning contracts, auctions, insurance, environmental regulations
Iinternational relations, trade agreements, electoral campaigns
Most modern economic research includes game theoretical elements.
Eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize so far.

IA village with 100 married couples and a high priest.
IThe men had to pass a logic exam before being allowed to marry.
IIt is common knowledge that the high priest is truthful.
IThe men would gossip about adulterous relationships and each
knows which of the other wives are unfaithful.
INo one would ever inform a husband about his cheating wife.
IThe high priest knows that some wives are unfaithful and decides that
such immorality should no longer be tolerated.

ISolution concepts motivated by presuming that players make
predictions about their opponents play by introspection and
deduction, using knowledge of their opponents payoffs, rationality. . .
IAlternatively, assume players extrapolate from past observations of
play in similar games and best respond to expectations based on
past observations.
ICournot (1838) suggested that players take turns setting their outputs
in the duopoly game, best responding to the opponents last-period
action.
ISimultaneous action updating, best responding to average play,
populations of players anonymously matched (another way to think
about mixed strategies), etc.
IIf the process converges to a particular steady state, then the steady
state is a Nash equilibrium.

          <text>Remarks
IThe fact that there is no protable deviation in pure strategies implies
there is no protable deviation in mixed strategies either.
IIf in equilibrium a player uses a mixed strategy that places positive
probability on several pure strategies, he must be indifferent between
all pure strategies in its support.
IStrategies that do not survive iterated strict dominance (or are not
rationalizable) cannot be played with positive probability in a Nash
equilibrium.

          <text>Remarks
In a nite game, the elimination procedure ends in a nite number of steps,
soS1is simply the set of strategies left at the nal stage.
In an innite game, if Sis a compact metric space and uis continuous,
then one can use Cantors theorem (a decreasing nested sequence of
non-empty compact sets has nonempty intersection) to show that S1,;.
Denition assumes that at each iteration all dominated strategies of every
player are deleted simultaneously. In a nite game, the limit set S1does
not depend on the particular order in which deletion proceeds.
Outcome does not change if we eliminate s. dominated mixed strategies at
every step. A strategy dominated against all pure strategies of the
opponents iff it is dominated against all their mixed strategies. Eliminating
mixed strategies for player iat any stage does not affect the set of s.
dominated pure strategies for any j,iat the next stage.

Theorem 9
Consider a game (N;S;u)such that S iis a convex and compact subset of
a Euclidean space and that u iis continuous in s and quasi-concave in s i
for all i2N. Then there exists a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
The result implies the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in
generalizations of the Cournot competition game.
Theorem 9 also implies the existence of mixed strategy Nash equilibria in
nite games.

          <text>Epistemic Foundations
IAumann and Brandenburger (1995): a framework that can be used to
examine the epistemic foundations of Nash equilibrium.
IThe primitive of their model is an interactive belief system in which
there is a possible set of types for each player; each type has
associated to it a payoff for every action prole, a choice of which
action to play, and a belief about the types of the other players.
IIn a 2-player game, if the game being played, the rationality of the
players, and their conjectures are all mutually known, then the
conjectures constitute a Nash equilibrium.
IFor games with more than 2 players, we need to assume additionally
that players have a common prior and that conjectures are commonly
known. This ensures that any two players have identical and
separable (independent) conjectures about other players, consistent
with a mixed strategy prole.

          <text>The Beauty Contest and the Stock Market
It is not a case of choosing those faces that, to the best of ones
judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those that average
opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third
degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what
average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there
are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fth and higher
degrees. (John Maynard Keynes, General Theory of
Employment, Interest and Money, 1936)
Keynes suggested that similar behavior is observed in the stock market.
Shares are not priced based on what people think their fundamental value
is, but rather on what they think everyone else thinks the value is and what
they think about these beliefs, and so on.

automatically subgame-perfect (backward induction argument).

However, not necessarily a trembling-hand perfect equilibrium in the

          <text>Properties of Stable Equilibria
Theorem 6
There exists a stable set that is contained in a connected component of
the set of Nash equilibria. Generically, each component of the set of Nash
equilibria leads to a single distribution over outcomes, so there exists a
stable set that induces a unique outcome distribution. A stable set
contains a stable set of any game obtained by eliminating a weakly
dominated strategy and also of any game obtained by deleting a strategy
that is not a best response to any of the opponents strategy proles in the
set (NWBR).
NWBRrobustness to forward induction: knowing that a player would not
use a particular strategy is consistent with the equilibrium theories from
the stable set

sends message musing NWBR, the reduced game should have a
stable set contained in the original set.

          <text>Discussion
The equilibrium fails the intuitive criterion if some sender type is getting
less than any payoff he could possibly get by playing m, assuming he
could convince the sender that he is not in T~(m)because mdoes not
make sense for any of those types.
In the beer-quiche example, the quiche equilibrium fails this criterion.
Iterated intuitive criterion
IUse the intuitive criterion as above to rule out pairs (t;m).
IRule out actions of R, by requiring that Rbest respond to a belief
about types that have not yet been eliminated given the message.
IPossibly rule out more pairs (t;m)given surviving strategies. . .
