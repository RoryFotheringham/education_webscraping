[1] Positional  Faithfulness : in many languages contrasts are restricted to particular positions

	  ranking sc  hema i  s Ident -[F]position   M  Ident -[F]  
McCarthy  TGOT  p.  88.   Nancowry  like  French  has  a  contrast  between  oral  and  nasal  vowels  but  
nasal  vowels  are  restricted to stressed syllables,  which  are  root  final.  Given R ichness  of the  Base  
there  could  be  an  input  with  a  nasal  vowel  in  the  unstressed  syllable;  but  it  can  be  mapped  to  
oral  if faithfulness fo  r n asality  in  the  stressed  syllable  dominates  *V,  which  dominates  general  
Ident- [nasal] :  
Ident -[nasal]   *V     Ident -[nasal]

&gt; ba t   *   
bata  *!   *

It is im portant to  realize  that the  positional  restr iction  is d efined  in  terms o  f output properties;  it 
is o nly  the  feature  mentioned  in  Ident -[F] whose i  nput corresponde nt  is  being  assessed.  Stress  in  
Nancowry is  apparently predictable and  not  necessarily  recorded  in  the i nput.

	  in  bottom -up derivation when syllables  are  organized into feet  and nonfinal  but

	  the  problem  the  Hind i data  present is th  at extrametricality  must be  suspended  just  in  
case  the  final  syllable  is h eaviest in  the  word;

	  generalization:  the cons onant  that  survives  deletion i s  the  one  that ha s  the  most acou stic

	  research  question:  under c  lassical  phonological  theory  such  rich  phonetic  detail  is  not  
present  in  the input  and  perhap s  only supplied in a  post-phonological  phonetic  
component  
	  do we  abandon thi s  assumption and allow a   rich  input  with  full  phonetic  detail?  (cf.  
Stampe s  critique  of  archiphonem e:  UR  is  a sound not  an ab straction  like  a  feature  
matrix)  
	  Steriade s  position  is  actually that  OT  grammar  does  not  refer  directly  to auditory cues; 
rather the  cues  define  a  scale  of  perceptibility  based  on  lingui stic  experience;  this  extra-
grammatical  P-map  is  used  to  project  constraints  into  CON  that operate  over d iscrete  
repre sentations ; neverthele ss  the  number o  f phonological  categorie s  is  larger than what  
is  traditionally  envi sioned  in  more  classical  versions  of  generative  grammar  including 
OT  encompassing such  noncontrastive  properties  as  stop  release  
	  the  number o  f credible  examples o  f remote  interaction  is n ot large;  phonology  seems  
fundamentally  local;  classical  OT  seems to   miss th is b asic  feature  of grammar  
undergeneration:  
 Opacity ; the  classical  model  of OT  has  no mechani sm to  deal  directly  with  this   
pervasive  feature  of language;   
proposals  to introduce  a restricted  degree o  f  serialism  in  the i nput-output  mapping:    
	  Kiparskys  Lexical  Phonology  OT  (Kiparsky  2000) has  classic  one-step  OT  
modules  defined  over  a  feed-forward  derivation defined in terms  of  the  
morphology:  root  &gt;  stem &gt;  word  &gt;  phrase ; each  module can  have different  
constraint  rankings   
	  McCarthys  (2008)  Harmonic  Serialism allows  for  repeated  GEN  &gt;  EVAL  cycles  
in  which  a  minimal  modification  is m ade  at each  step;  the  derivation gradually  
converges  on  the  optimal  output  form;  a  single  constraint  ranking  imposes  a  
uniform  faithfulness -markedness  distinction

o	  here  repair  is  deletion  rather  than  more  minimal  devoicing  perhaps  because    
nasal+voiceless  stop  is a   relative ly marked cluster   
o	  a domain  is  needed  to  restrict  the locus  of  violation:  both  coda consonants  and  voiced  
obstruents  are  individually marked and so the  German  ban  on  voiced  codas  may  be  
treated  as c onjuction  [+voice] &amp;   No -Coda  within  the  domain of  a segment ; it would be  
unusual  to have  domain of  syllable  or  word banning  a  coda  consonant  and a  voiced 
obstruent  yielding a state of  affairs  where  [mab]  and  [ba]  are good  but  [bad], [bat], 
[ban]  are not  
o	  self-conjunction  has  been  used  to  formalize  constraints  like  Lymans  Law  in  Japanese 
that bans tw  o  or m ore  voiced  obstruents in   a  morpheme  (Ito  &amp;  Mester 2002)  
o	  constraint  conjunction  is  a  powerful  device  that  must  be  restricted:  it typically  involves  
markedness  relations  along  a  phonetic  scale  (Flemming  24.964,  2012): for e  xample  
closure  voicing  duration :  *long voiced clo sure d uration    *short  voiced cl  osure  duration

[1]  a term  and  intuition  that  derives  from  the Prague School  of  Trubetz koy  (1939) and  Jakobson  
 (1941)  
 Jakobson  speculates  that the  order o  f acquisition  of sounds b  y  the  child,  the  order o  f  
 loss of sound in aphasia, and the implicational laws in the  structure o  f  phonemic    
 inventories ,  all  reflect  the same underlying hierarchy; e.g. fricatives im  plies s tops, velars   
 imply  coronals,  nasal  vowel  implies c  orresponding  oral  vowel  
[2]  in  the  contemporary  context ,  markedness  means  that  one  sound or  structure  is  preferred to 
another  in  a given  context : a    b; the dispreferred one is said to be marked with respect to the  
preferred or  unmarked  one: thus nasal vowels are marked with respect to or al  vowels;  voiced  
stops are m  arked  with  respect  to v oiceless stops;  complex sy  llable o  nsets are m  arked  with  respect  
to  simple  onsets;  contour  tones  are  marked  with  respect  to  level  tones,  .  
[3] SPE  Chapter  9  attempted  to build  this  distinction  into rules  so t hat  the c hange t  o a n  unmarked  
structure w  ould  be m ore h ighly v  alued  by  the  evaluation metric;  but  the  formalism w  as  not  
worked  out  and  this  approach  never  got  off  the ground  
[4]  Stampes  (1972)  Theory of  Natural  Phonology  
	  another  attempt  to  give markedness  an explicit  role  in phonological  grammars  
	  Stampe distinguishes  Natural  Processes  like German  Final  Devo icing  from  more  arbitra ry  
rules like t  he V elar Soften ing  in  critic    critic- ism  
  A p honological  process  is  a  mental  operation  that  applies  in  speech  to  substitute,  for  a 
  class  of  sounds  or  sound  sequences  presenting  a  specific common  difficulty  to  the  speech  
  capacity  of  the  individual,  an  alternative  class  identical  but  lacking  the  difficult    
  property .  p.  1

[5]  Calabrese  (1984, 1995, 2005 )  
	  a derivational  model  that  utilizes  both  ordered rules  and markedness  constraints  
	  like Stampe , Calabrese  distinguishes  between phonetically  arbitrary  rules  like  Velar  
Softening which  are conventionalized  products  of  history ( cf.  in  the  US  we  drive  on  the  
right  side o f  the ro ad  and  in  Japan  on  the l eft) and  phonetically  motivated  repairs that  
advance  a rule output  to a  more  natural  state i n  the i nterests of  ease o f  articulation  and  
perception;  but  this  force  is c ounter -balanced by  economy,  which  wants  to  shorten  the  
input- output  path ,  and  which  (following  Bromberger -Halle  2000)  Calabrese  assumes  to  
take  place  in  real  time1  
  when  a rule g ives an  output  that  violates  a  constraint  then a  limited set  of  repairs  kicks  in   
  once  the  repair is made,  the  derivation  procee ds  to the  next  ordered rule

          <text>12Cases where the input refers to /i/ or/u/ should be taken to include /y/ and /w/, since their
feature specifications are the same (the glide symbols are used here when the segment is
part of a consonantal root). The vowel // has no place features, so it cannot really
participate in coalescence: in the first two examples above /i/ and /u/ simply associate to an
empty mora and / / never appears; thisprocess is referred to here asVocalization, but isin
factan automatic effect of syllabification. As illustrated below in (48), the vowels in the
corners of the vowel space (/i,u,a/) cannot combine with each other because each pairing
would violate one of the constraints in (7);the same is true of the pair /e,o/, which would
create *//.
Consequently, the only meaningful examples of coalescence involve /!/ and some
other vowel.  All possibilities are attested.  Since / !/ issimply [high], it serves to lower the
high vowels /i,u/ and has no effect on /e,o,a/, which are already nonhigh:
(37) Coalescence with high vowels
!+ i _ e !+ u _ o
high - - - -
low
back - -
round + +
(38) Coalescence with nonhigh vowels
!+ e _ e !+ o _ o !+ a _ a
high - - - - - - - -
low + +
back - -
round + +
Inall cases the output features are identical to the underlying radical underspecification of
the output vowel given in (5),except that in (38) the redundant value [high] ispresent for
/a/.  There are times when two instances of /!/ coalesce, where naturally the output isthe
same vowel; see below for more discussion.
The examples above suggest that the mechanism of vowel coalescence in Tigrinya is a
rule which simply merges (or unifies) the feature matrixes oftwo adjacent vowel seg-
ments.  Itis a mirror image process, i.e. it applies whether the first orsecond ofthe two
feature matrices is linked to a mora.
15Similar facts hold in Amharic (Leslau 1967, Hartmann 1980), which hasan identical vowel inven-
tory, suggesting that the same underspecification and coalescence rule may be motivated for that language.     Seoul  Korean:  long vowels  restricted  to word- initial  syllable:   [+lon g]    [-long]

          <text>24.961  Phonotactics  and Markedness  
1.  Phonotactics:  systematic  restrictions on  possible  sound  sequences and  word  shape  
 no English  word begins  with  velar  nasal    or  tl; no word ends in h  
 Halle  (1962) 	  brick  attested
  
    blick   possible  but  unattested
  
    bnick  impossible
  
 
2.  Research  by  Albright  (2007) and  others  shows  that  these judgments  are often gradient:   
  bnick   bzick   bdick   ldick       = better  than  
 
3.  Research  by  Brendt  (1993),  Jusczyk (1997)  and others  demonstrates  that infants a  re  sensitive  to  
phonotactic  constraints  before  they  acquire  a  lexicon;  knowledge  of  phonotactics  can help with 
parsing  an  utterance  to find the  word  boundaries.  
4.  various  questions  one can  ask  about  phonotactics   
	  What  level  are  they  stated  at:  lexical  level,  surface phonetic,  or  some intermediate level ?  Many  
languages have restrictions on roots that dont necessarily carry over to larger domains : e.g. 
Japanese  idom -u,  idon- de  challenge  has  two voiced obstruents  (cf.  Lymans Law)  
	  are they p ositive  or  negative  or  both?  
	  Are  they  redundant?  A rule  of  final  devoicing  entails that no word ends in  [b,d,g ]. Does it  
make  any  sense  to  say  that  there  is  a  separate  phonotatic  constraint?  If  so,  what  is  its  relation  
to  the  rule,  which  is n eeded  in  any  case,  to  account  for  alternations?  
	  On  the  other  hand,  one  can  turn  this  argument  around:  many  alternations  are  motivated  to  
maintain  more  general  phonotactic  constraints : in Seoul Korean long vowels only found in  
initial  syllables;  when  word  is p laced  in  second  position  in  a  compound,  length  is  lost  
	  How  many  such  constraints  can  be  reduced  to  constraints  on  syllable  structure : e.g *[+voice]  
in  obstruent codas , no complex onsets with tl, no syllable onsets with  ?  
	  How  does  one  express  the  gradience  of  the  judgments?  Should  one do so  (i.e.  is it  a  part  of  the  
grammar) ?  
	  When  subjects  give  ratings  like  bnick   bzick   bdick   ldick  in  response  to  question  How  
good  a word  of  English  is  X?  are they giving a judgment  based on  their k nowledge  of English  
or  a  more  general  intuition on how di  fficult  it  is  to pronounce  the  cluster?  Would speakers  of  a  
CV  language  like  Japanese  give  similar  gradient  responses?  Would  we  obtain  similar  gradience  
for  judgments  among existing clusters:  e.g. German knV, klV,  kV?  See  Berent  et  al.  (2007).

Observations 
	 Continental French ha s the faithful m apping: output same as input 
	 to compel a chan ge, some mark e dness constraint must dominate some faithfulness 
constraint 
	 Minimal violation: thea also s atisfies Sonority Sequencing but with an unnecessary 
violation of faithfulness (cf. economy of derivation) 
[4] Conspiracies 
	 OT separates the Structural Descrip t ion (SD) of a rule from the Structural Change 
	 Hence the same SD expressed as a Marke dness constraint may figure in more than one 
alternation as well as state a static phonotactic constraint 
	 its scope is determined by its ranking with other constraints

          <text>[5] Remarks 
	 The conspiracy wh ere Minim al Word is involved in more than one alternation is now 
expressed formally with a single constraint 
	 Economy is built in to the model: every departure from input must be for a reason: to 
satisfy a Markedness constraint 
	 Thus the derivat ion where /wi te/ interior is apocopated and then augmented is 
automatically ruled out4

[6] more details: 
	 Alternative repairs must be excluded 
	 Since the constra int set is assumed to be universal , the grammar of every language has 
every constraint and so they all must be ranked 
	 General assumption is that all constraints are undominated until evidence shows that a 
ranking mu

          <text>224.901 Phonological Constraints and Optimality Theory
Nov. 22, 2010
1. Optimality Theory (Prince &amp; Smolensky 1993, 2003)
partially successful solution to the constraint problem
received model of phonolgical theory in generative grammar today
two constraint types
markedness: structural well-formedness of output: *, Onset, *Lapse
faithfulness: correspondence relation between input and output assumed
Max: every segment of input has correspondent in outputDep: every segment of output has correspondent in input
Ident -[feature]: two corresponding segments have same value for feature F
constraints are violable  (not always true of surface output) and conflicting
conflict resolved by ranking
typology by ranking: all systematic differences between grammars arise from
different ranking of a fixed set of UG constraints
!every language must fall in the class of possible rankings
!every ranking describes a possible language
what is carried over from traditional generative model:
!input-output mapping
!autosegmental, prosodic representations (OT is not a theory of representationsthough proposed constraints may have representational commitments)
what is not carried over:
!no rules
!no constraints on inputs (morpheme-structure constraints)

   	 The constraints may conflict2: e.g. there are alternative r epairs to a hiatus violation *V V 
Inserting a segment not present in the input: D ep 
Deleting a segment from the input : Max 
Changing a feature coefficient in one (or both) of the segments 
	 A particular grammar arises from imposing a prioritization or ranking on the constraints : 
A  B (A 
dominates, outranks B) e.g. epenthesis as re pair (/Fr /blabla -e/ &gt; [blablate]

	 for each input GENerate constructs a (possibly) infinite set of output candidates 
	 the constraints (in a fixed ranking) evaluate  the candidates by assessing violation 
marks 
	 the output  for a given input is defined as the candidate that best satisfies the
 
constraint hierarchy

 
	 winner-take-all: a candidate's value is not improved relative to another by
 
performing better on lower ranked constraints
 

	 tableau is a device analogous to a truth table to prove that one candidate is more optimal (harmonic) than another

segment in the input ( dont insert )

w 
	 Distinctive features: interface between lexicon and phonetic component; natural classes 
	 Ordered rules: effective analysis of alternations and opacity 
	 Constraints: static well -formedne ss conditions over lexicon; analysis of possible word 
	 Conspiracies: cross -linguist ically common rule targets with diverse repairs; also appear 
in a single language; may trigger as well as block a rule 
	 Markedness: Jakobson s Laws of Solidarity and Stampes Natural Processes: preference 
hierarchies: nasal vowel implies and oral vowel; velar stop implies a coronal stop, etc. 
[1]. Optimality Theory (Prince &amp; Smolensky 1993, 2004) 
	 A model of input -output mapping, not representations 
	 Assumes distinction between lexical representat ion and ph onetic output 
	 Rewrite rules A -&gt; B / C__ __D are decomposed into two separate functions: the structural 
description CAD defining the input to the rule is expressed as a static well -formedness 
(markedness) constraint banning such a structure *CAD a nd hence compelling a change 
to the input; the structural change A -&gt; B is replaced by a GEN function defining a 
space of possible outputs for that input that could in principle be found in any language 
	 The other type of constraint is a Faithfulness constr aint that m ilitates against a change 
from the input; in rule terms, it is analogous to an identity rule1 mapping the input to 
itself: A -&gt; A / C____D; it is somewhat analogous to Calabreses economy of derivation  
force that wants to shorten the input -output map and is perhaps the most innovative and 
distinctive feature of OT 
	 Markedness constraints are defined over the output and evaluate for the presence or 
absence of 
desirable features and structures 
	 They are assumed to be part of UG (innate or indu ced from co mmon shared experience) 
	 Markedness constraints are typically stated in negative fashion : *V penalize a nasal 
vowel , Onset: penalize syllables without a consonantal onset, *Clash: penalize two 
successive stressed syllables,  
	 Faithfulness constraints penalize disparities between the input and the output 
	 A correspondence relation is assumed be tween the in put and output indicated (when 
necessary) by co -indexing over segments (and possibly features as well) 
1 Identity rules were proposed by Kiparsky (1982) in order to restrict rules to derived environments

Stress in snto but pag -santw -n looks suspiciously like a derivation in which stress is assigned to
 
the penult of /pag -santo -an/ an d then the  is devocalized with the stress shifting to the next
 
vowel: /pag -santo -an/ -&gt; /pag -sant -an/ -&gt; pag -santw -n. This opacity cannot be expressed in
 
Classic OT where the derivation between input and output occurs in one step. There are variants
 
of OT that propose serial derivations such as Stratal OT (Kiparsky 2000, Bermudez -Otero 2011)
 
and McCarthys (2007) Harmonic Serial OT. The former can express penultimate stress followed
 
by devocalization as a switch in constraint rankings from Ident- [syll]  Onset to On set  Ident -
[syll] plus some reasonable assumptions about prosodic foot structure. In Harmon i c Serial OT
 
the input is gradually transformed to the output b y a series of Gen -Eval cycles. Some o paque
 
derivations arise from ranked precedence constraints that demand a certain sequence of
 
unfaithful mappings to reach the output. You will learn about these approaches in 24.962.

2.  Alternative  foot  theory: stress reflects a  parsing  of  syllables  into a symmetric  units called f  eet.  There  are   
 two basic types of feet: a  trochee  in which the first element is strong and the second weak  and an  iamb  in which  
the first is weak and the second strong . Feet are optimally disyllabic, but a monosyllabic foot can  be  created as  a

o	  Here  instead  of  a  rule  changing  a  coefficient  to  conform  to  a  constraint,  the  constraint  blocks  the 
application  of  a rule.   
o	  We  can  also  ask  if  the  "redundant"  [+voice]  in  an  NC  cluster  will  "activate"  Lyman's  Law.

[8]  conclusion  
 
o	  rules o  f s ound  change  can  either be  blocked  (e.g.  rendaku)  or  be  activated  (post -nasal  voicing)  to 
conform  to  a constraint  that  also  governs  "static"  generalizations  over  the lexicon.   
o	  How does  one  unify  these  disparate  reflections  of  the  post-nasal  voicing generalization and Lyman's  
Law  into  single  grammatical  statements?    
o	  OT's  answer  is  to  dispense  with  rules  entirely  and  express  all  phonological  generalizations  as 
constraints.   
 
[9].  Problem  of conspiracies:  Kisseberth 1  970.  Notes  that  *CCC  is  avoided at  several  different  points  in the 
phonology of  Yokuts  Yawelmani:  
 
o	  no CC C in  roots  
o	  no CCC  on the  surface  (accidental  product  of  rules?)   
o	  but  several  different  rules  conspire  to achieve  this  effect:   
VC+ChV -&gt; VCCV   cons  deletion  
CVCC+CV -&gt; CVCiCCV   epenthesis  
CVCiC+V  -&gt; CVCC+V  i-deletion blocked just  in case  would create  *CCC

o	  What  is  the  formal  statement?

Derivational  Constraints  and  Conspiracies  
[1].  Ordered r  ewrite  rules  are  an e ffective  way t o fo rmalize  sound c  hange  and d erivational  opacity.  But  other  
aspects  of  phonological  competence seem  better  suited  to  constraint  formalism.   
 
[2]  limitations  on s ound i  nventory a  nd s hape:   
 
o	  Fijian  p,  t,  k  vs.  English  p,  t,  k,  b,  d,  g.  
o	  how do  we  deal  with the  absence  of  something?  
o	  does  it  make  any sense  to say that  Fijian  could  have [b]  but  does  not?  Actively  reject  it?   
o	  This  implies  that  speaker  knows  about  [b].  More  generally that  typologically the  absence  of  some 
property is  as  important  as  its  presence  (cf.  Principles  &amp;  Parameters).  
o	  One  answer  to this question  was  to  follow the  structuralists  (Trubetzkoy,  Bloomfieldians):  In  English  
[-voice]  and [+voice]  contr ast  and  so  are unpredictable and  hence listed  in  the lexicon   
o	  but  [-voice]  in Fijian is  redundant;  if  the  lexicon is  the  repository of  unpredictable  information,  we  can 
represent  Fijian  /p/  as [ 0voice] and  posit  a  rewrite  rule:  
[-sonorant]  -&gt; [-voice]   
o	  Now English  and  Fijian  are  formally  different;  we  use  rewrite  rules.   
[3].  Problems  with t his  approach:  it  doesnt  lend i tself well  to o ther  cases   
o	  Fijian  is  CV.  No  CCV,  again  different  from  English.   
o	  Do  we  say  every  consonant  is  followed by a  vowel  ( [0co ns]  -&gt; [-cons]  / [+cons]  ___)  or  every  vowel  
is preceded by a consonant ([0cons]  -&gt; [+cons]  /  ___  [-cons]?  Directionality  problems.  
o	  In  many  cases ru  les m ust  refer to  the  redundant  information:  e.g.  stress f  alls o n  vowels n  ot  on
 
consonants  so  we must  fill  in the  [0consonantal]  for  the  stress  rule  to work properly.  
   
o	  Proposed  solution:  Morpheme -Structure  Rules: state generalizations over the lexicon on the shape of  
words  and  morphemes  before  lexical  insertion  and  hence  entry  into  the  phonological  component.   
o	  But  then  a  "duplication  problem"  (Kenstowicz  &amp; K isseberth  1976)  arises  where  the  same  constraint  
expressing  passive limitations  on  morpheme form  (Morpheme -Structure  Rules)  also  plays  an  active  
role  in  shaping  the  output  of ru les g overning  alternations.   
[4].  Japanese obstruent  voicing  (data and  analysis  from  Ito  &amp;  Mester  1986,  2003)  
 
o	  Contrast  of  [voice]:  asa  morning  vs.  aza  bruise;  aka  red,  aga  fried  tofu  
o	  In  Yamato  (native)  and  mimetic vocabulary  no  voice contrast  after  nasals: 
 
tombo dragonfly,  kande  chewing,  unzari  disgusted,  kangae  'thought'; 
   
o	  MSR:  [-sonorant]  -&gt; [+voice]  /  [+nasal]  ___     
o	  controls  output  of  concatenation:   
tabe-ru   tabe-te   'eat'
  
 sin-u   sin-de   'die'
  
 yom-u   yon-de   'read'
  
o	  If p ostnasal  voicing  in  its M SR  function  applies  solely in the  lexicon before  morpheme  combination,  
then we seem to say the same thing twice: obstruents voice after a nasal in the lexicon and again in the  
phonological  component ; how can the same rule be in two different places?   
o	  Alternatively,  the  rule  can  be  taken  out  of l exicon  and  placed  in  the  phonological  component ; but then  
it has a  double  function  (fills  in z eros for  tombo  and  changes  contrastive values  for  -t   -d).   
o	  But  now  we  no  longer  directly  state  a  generalization  that  is  true  of  morpheme  shapes  in the  lexicon. 
What  is  to  prevent  a  voiceless  consonant  in  this  position?   
o	  Yamato  Japanese  lacks such lexical items--how i  s  this  generalization to be  expressed?

o	  There  is  no  effective  way  to  express  this  as  a  rule  filling  in  zeros.  We  need a  negative  constraint  on 
morpheme  shape:  
* [+voice]  ..  [+voice]  
[6].  What  about  the  redundant  [0voice]  after  a  nasal?  
o	  Does  it  allow a  violation  of  Lyman's  Law?   
o	  Apparently  not:  *dombo.   
o	  Thus  it  appears  that  a  redundant  [+voice]  functions  the  same as  a contrastive one for  this 
generalization.  Hence  we  need
  
tombo        *  dombo 
  
|   |   |
 
[+voi]      [+voi]  [+voi]
  
o	  We  also  require  a  negative  statement  of  the  constraint:  *[+nasal]  [-voice]  
o	  Now the  post-nasal  voicing sound ch ange in  /yom -te/  -&gt; yonde   appears  to  be a way  to  "satisfy"  the 
constraint.   
o	  But  now  we  are  even  further  from  the  goal  of  a  unified  statement  since  we  have  a  constraint  *[nasal]  [-
voice]  and a  rule  that  changes  [-voice]  to [+voice]  after  a  nasal  to ev identl y satisfy the  constraint. But  it 
gets  worse.

          <text>5  Similarity is evaluated on perceptual representations  and hence will be sensitive to the 
contexts where different cues will be available; articulation can be quite different: e.g. lip 
rounding and tongue backing have the same acoustic effect  
 Hence conf usability may be a distinct source of evidence  
 Some auditory representations are differentiated by fewer and less salient properties than others. This makes them more similar and, in the limit, more confusable p. 156  
 evidence may come from direct judgme nts of similarity, the acoustic distribution of cues, 
or linguistic tasks like rhyming and alliteration as well as loanword adaptation

     24.961 Licensing by Cue and P -Map 
[1] With the development of explicit models of syllable structure and prosodic parsing, 
differenc
es in the range of permitted consonantal contrasts in the onset vs. coda were noted for 
many languages. 
	 Place contrasts in Lardil and Japanese 
	 Laryngeal contrasts in German, Korean, Klamath 
	 Rhotics in English and German 
[2] This was modeled by licensing conditions on codas (Ito 1986, Goldsmith 1990, Lombardi 
1991). In the 
OT framework they can be expressed in terms of positional markedness or positional 
faithfulness 
	 Positional markedness: *[+voice, sonorant ]/ V___]   Ident -[voice] 
 
*[+voice, sonorant]
 
	 Positional Faithfulness (Lombardi 1999): Ident -[voice] / [_ __ V]  *[voice, son]  Ident -
[voice] 
[3] Steriade (1997, 1999) challenged this reasoning and argued that the relevant factor is not 
locatio
n in prosodic structure but the relative availability of auditory cues to the contrasts in 
different segmental contexts. Two typological surveys were conducted to support this conclusion: 
laryngeal contrasts and retroflexion.

[4] Perceptual faithfulness cannot account for enhancement effects where other features or cues 
are inserted to sharpen a c ontrast: e.g. length on V1 for voicing, aspiration on voiceless 
stop, F0 raising or lowering: they appear to be violations of faithfulness1 and hence should 
be penalized; one position is that enhancement is not in the grammar (Keyser &amp; Stevens); 
if they ar e, then the range of phonetic properties under grammatical control is enlarged 
considerably (e.g. larynx lowering); enhancement is motivated by a distinct set of contrast constraints in Flemming (2004)

 in Zwickys (1976) corpus of rhymes in rock songs, a change in voicing is one of the most 
common slant rhymes: t- d (7), s -z (9); minimal departure in faithfulness  
 
[2]  P -Map and epenthesis sites (Flemming 2007, Fullwood 2013)  
 
 observation: there is a cross -linguistic hierarchy in epenthesis sites for consonant clusters 
such that for a given C1, epent hesis tracks the sonority of C2, where epenthesis before a 
lower sonority C2 implies epenthesis before higher sonority C2.

          <text>4  for the suspension of other contrasts, the outcome of neutralization can vary: e.g. in 
Gooniyandi there is free variation in retroflexion; contrasts in word -final nasal place can 
be resolved as n (Castillian Sp) or   (Caribbean Spanish) or m   (Manam)  
 We may exp ect the same distribution of voicing in a language that does not contrast 
voiced and voiceless obstruents; e.g. intervocalic voicing but final and initial devoicing  
 Answer: in the absence of contrast, articulatory effort constraints may take over to 
deter mine the output (but they can be over -ruled by uniformity constraints); thus, 
voiceless in initial onset position is motivated by the claim that it is more difficult to 
initiate voicing during an obstruent than it is to sustain voicing from a preceding 
sonorant because the former requires a greater pressure drop across the glottis (Westbury 
&amp; Keating 1986, J of Ling 22, 145 -66) 
 The typology that word -final contrasts are more poorly cued  than presonorant ones 
predicts that word -final voicing contrasts could be preserved before sonorants in the next 
word, where cues would be realized; but Russian and Lithuanian devoice before a sonorant as well; in Cracow Polish a final obstruent voices before a sonorant but this includes underlying voiced and voiceless so the  contrast is still suspended. Steriade 
suggests an Output -Output Paradigm uniformity constraint to the prepausal, isolation 
form as the normal speech style to which the learner is attuned ; some abstraction to the 
notion Canonical Word is needed  
[9] P -Map: perceptual markedness constraints on voicing reinterpreted as faithfulness con straints: 
P(erceptual) -map (Steriade 2001, 2009)  
 is a distinct component of the grammar  
 it projects correspondence (faithfulness) constraints and their ranking into the grammar  
 a statement of the relative perceptibility of different contrasts across different contexts 
[2] motivation  
 the predicted range of repairs for a given constraint violation is too broad and needs to be restricted  
 repair for the ban on word -final voiced obstru ents is devoicing rather than nasalization, 
deletion, epenthesis , metathesis  
 intuition of a minimal departure from the input:  the output most similar to the input  
 P-map projects  (b-m) &gt;  (b-p) to Ident -[nasal]/ ___ ]   Ident -voice]/__]  
 Evidence can be the search for cross -linguistically favored repairs or from 
psycholinguistic studies of sound similarity or such naturalistic domains as loanword adaptation and judgments of rh yme</text>

[5] Feeding and Bleeding (Kiparsky 1968,  1971)  
If Rule  A  creates p  otential  inputs to   rule  B  and  rule  B  applies,  we  say  A  feeds  B and  this  can  be  
described by  requiring  A  to precede  B.  
If Rule  A  creates p  otential  inputs to   rule  B  and  rule  B  does n ot apply,  we  say  A  counterfeeds  B 
and  this  can  be described  by requiring B  to  precede A.  
If Rule  A  removes p  otential  inputs to   rule  B  and  B  does n  ot apply  we  say  A  bleeds  B and  this  can  
be  described by  requiring  A  to  precede  B.  
If rule  A  removes p  otential  inputs to   rule  B  and  B  does a  pply  we  say  A  counterbleeds  B and  this  
can  be  described  by  requiring  B  to  precede  A.   e.g.  flapping  and  shortening+raising  before  a  
voiceless  consonant  in  English  Canadian  raising.  
Kiparsky  (1968) proposed that  rules  may  diachronically  change  their  order  towards  feeding  and 
bleeding  relations.  These  are  situations  in which each rule  is  true  of  the  surface  form.  
Counterfeeding  and  counterbleeding  create  situations  in  which  the  earlier  rule is  not  true of  the 
surface f  orm  and  hence   opaque .  One  must  undo  the  effects  of  the  later  rule  to  see  the  full  
effects  of  the earlier  rule.  It was s  uggested  by  Kiparsky  (1971)  that opacity  was m ore  difficult to  
learn.  It would be interesting to revisit  this q uestion  today  with  an  artificial  language  learning  
experiment.    
[6] Summary  
 
The  SPE model  with ordered  rewrite  rules  defined  over  sounds  represented  as  distinctive  feature  
matrixes  showed  that  considerab le analytic insight into the st ructure o  f  a l anguage could  be 
obtained.  Its  concern with  formal  statements  and explicit  representations  created a generative 
grammar:  an  input -output  mechanism  whose  scope  went  well  beyond mere  summaries  of  the  
data  in a  corpus.  Thus  a  scientific  research program  was  create d in which  many  new que stions  
arise in  extendin g the ordered  rule format  to more data both  language- internally  as w ell  as c ross-
linguistically.  
 
We  sample  here  a few  of  the questions  that  arose.

          <text>11Given an inventory of contrasting segments, the goal is to realize the full inventory of
contrasts in all contexts. So possible underlying forms consist of all sequences of segments from
the inventory and the goal is to realize these underlying forms faithfully. In some casesunderlying contrasts are neutralized because they cannot be realized with sufficient
distinctiveness in a particular context, as in final neutralization of obstruent voicing contrasts.
Following Flemming (2002), we will analyze the restriction on front rounded vowels inCantonese in similar terms. Coarticulation with an adjacent labial renders [i] too similar to frontrounded [y], so the contrast is neutralized in this context. In both cases the evaluation of
distinctiveness must apply to the surface realizations of the contrasts in order to take contextual
effects such as labial coarticulation into account. However, M
INDIST  and M AXIMIZE CONTRASTS
must not interact freely with contextual markedness constraints if we are to account for the
relative stability of inventories across contexts. Reconciling these two generalizations motivates
the distinction between Realization and Evaluation of Surface Contrasts (ESC). The Realizationcomponent maps an input string onto its phonetic realization while the ESC assesses thedistinctiveness of contrasts based on these phonetic realizations. The Realization component
incorporates the contextual markedness constraints that motivate contextual variation in the
realization of contrasts but does not include M
INDIST constraints. The M INDIST constraints
evaluate the outputs of Realization in ESC but cannot directly influence the realization of a giveninput.
The application of this model to neutralization of front rounding contrasts is illustrated by
the tableaux in (15) and (16). It is easier to se ethe overall structure of the analysis byconsidering ESC first and then turn to the details of Realization.
To evaluate the distinctiveness of contrasts it is necessary to consider a target input in
relation to a set of minimally contrasting inputs. This set must at least contain all input forms thatdiffer from the target by changing, inserting or deleting a single segment, but generally mustcontain additional forms as will be discussed further below. Here we are interested in the input/pyn/ with a front rounded vowel adjacent to a labial. The contrast set for this input includes
inputs that differ in vowel quality, /pin, pun/. The candidates in ESC specify the fates of the
members of the contrast se, as illustrated in tableau (X). Each input form from the contrast setmay be realized or neutralized with a neighboring form. For example, /pin/ and /pyn/ can remaindistinct, or /pyn/ can be mapped onto /pin/. Neutralizations are indicated in the tableau by
showing in each candidate which input forms are distinguished, with subscripts indicating which
forms are merged (if any). The tableau shows three candidate realizations of the contrast set. In(a) all members remain distinct while in (b) and (c) the contrast between /pin/ and /pyn/ is
neutralized. In candidate (b) both are mapped onto /pin/ and in (c) both are mapped onto /pyn/.
14The ESC employs the same ranking of M INDIST constraints as the Inventory  there is no re-
ranking of constraints between components, although only certain classes of constraints apply in
each component. The initial hypothesis is that *M ERGE  also occupies the same place in the
ranking as M AXIMIZE CONTRASTS . This implies that the minimum level of distinctiveness that is
acceptable for a contrast in the inventory should also be the threshold below which a surface
contrast is neutralized. In the analysis above, the smallest acceptable F3 contrast must have a
distinctiveness of F3:2 since M INDIST = F3:2 ranks just above M AXIMIZE CONTRASTS (14). If
*MERGE  occupies the same position as M AXIMIZE CONTRASTS in the ranking of M INDIST
constraints, any contextual influence that would reduce the distinctiveness of an F3 contrast
below F3:2 should result in neutralization of that contrast, as above. We will see some evidence
that *M ERGE  may be allowed to rank higher than M AXIMIZE CONTRASTS  which would mean that
the level of distinctiveness required for a contrast to be included in the inventory is higher than
the level that is demanded of surface contrasts. This allows some leeway for contrasts to fallbelow their canonical level of distinctiveness without being neutralized. This might well be
necessary to account for cases in which contrasts are retained even in environments where their
distinctiveness seems to be significantly reduced. Padgett and Tabain (2005) provide evidencethat this is true of Russian vowel quality contrasts: unstressed vowels are less distinct in F1-F2
space than stressed vowels. Another possible case is discussed in section 8 below.
The inventory-based model avoids the problematic prediction that inventories should be
highly contextually-variable. Taking the example of the preceding analysis, we can see that these
constraints cannot derive the unattested variant pattern according to which central vowels are
substituted for front rounded vowels adjacent to labials. Non-low central vowels are nor part of
the basic inventory so they cannot appear in underlying representations. Realization will not mapan input front rounded vowel onto a central vowel because that would involve a violation offaithfulness that is not motivated by an markedness constraint that is active in Realization (cf.
17). In ESC, violation of M
INDIST  constraints can only be avoided by neutralizing a contrast, not
by reorganizing contrasts, so the contrast between [i] and [y] can be neutralized adjacent to	  In  the  ECS  there  are  (apparently) j  ust the  Mind Dist  constraints  and  a  general  *Merger

	  Constraints  evaluate  the  distance  between  contrasting  pairs  of  sounds  in perceptual  space

[2] Markedness  may  depend  on  contrast  (1995)  
	  For  nonlow vow  els,  lip rounding aligns with backness (an enhancement relation): [i-u]  is  
more  distinct  on F2 than  [i-y]  or  [i-];  
	  Theories  of  markedness  that  dont  invoke  contrast  posit  *y,    *i,u  (cf.  Calabreses  1995  
Filters)  
	  Correctly  states  that  a  language  will  choose  /i/  before  /y/  
	  But  Flemming  claims  that  central  vowels  like  [i]  are only marked  when  compared  to  [i]  and  
[u]  
	  In  a  system  that lacks  [i]  and  [u]  then  [i] may  be  the  optimal  vowel  on  articulatory  grounds ,  
since i  t  involves more m  inimal  tongue  displacement between  consonants

	  Calabrese  might  argue  that  Marshallese  vowels  are underspecified  for  front  vs.  back  rather  
than  being  central  
	  What  happens  at  word  edges  or  when  the  vowel  is  long:  do we see a central  vowel  quality 
steady st  ate?  Choi  (1992)  states  that long  vowels  have  an  F2  target  but  does  not  say  if  it  is  a  
central  vowel  
[3] dispersion t  heory  
	  An  inventory  of  sounds  is  a  compromise  between  constraints  maximizing  the  distance  
between the  sounds  along  some  auditory  dimension (e.g.  F1,  F2;  voicing  duration in 
consonants)  and  constraints  maximizing the number  of  sounds ,  with  articulatory  effort  being  
a third  factor  
	  Given  a  fixed  auditory  space ,  the  more  sounds there  are,  the  smaller th  e  distance  between  
them:  cf.  persons in   an  elevator

violate the highest-ranked constraint, L ARDIST(2v1)-[ejective], thus
eliminating candidates (a), (b) and (d). These violations of L ARDIST(2v1)-
[ejective] can be resolved either by eliminating the form with two
ejectives, [kapi], as in candidate (c), or by eliminating both forms with asingle ejective [kapi] and [kapi], as in candidate (e). Candidate (c) ispreferred over candidate (e) by I
DENT [ejective], despite the three vio-
lations of lower-ranked L ARDIST(1v0) incurred by the pairs {[kapi,
kapi]}, {[kapi, kapi]} and {[kapi, kapi]}. Like candidate (e), candidates(f)(j) satisfy highest-ranked L
ARDIST(2v1)-[ejective], but incur excessive
violations of faithfulness, and are thus eliminated by high-rankingI
DENT [ejective]. The tableau in (27) shows the evaluation of contrasting
pairs with homorganic stops. With H-L ARDIST(1v0)-[ejective] low-
ranked, dissimilation holds regardless of place of articulation.Perceptual distinctness and long-distance laryngeal restrictions 461
kati]}, {[kati, kati]}, {[kati, kati]} and {[kati, kati]}, eliminating can-
didates (a)(d), (f) and (g). Candidate (c), which shows dissimilation, loses
due to the contrasts {[kati, kati]}, {[kati, kati]} and {[kati, kati]}.Candidates (e) and (h)(j) all satisfy L
ARDIST(1v0), but candidate
(e) preserves two forms instead of one, and is thus preferred byI
DENT [ejective]. The formulation of L ARDIST(1v0) to penalise positional
contrasts is crucial to the analysis of assimilation, as candidates (e) and (f)do equally well on faithfulness and low-ranking L
ARDIST(2v1).
The tableau in (33) shows that assimilation also results when hom-
organic pairs of stops are considered.
LARDIST(1v0)-[ejective] forces neutralisation of contrasts in ejection in
roots with other voiceless stops, but not other voiced stops, as can be seen
in the tableau in (34). Here, all combinations of ejective, voiceless and
voiced stops are evaluated in parallel. The contrasts {kadi, kadi} and{gati, gati} are not ruled out by L
ARDIST(1v0), because [g d] bear the
feature [voice] and thus cannot contrast for [ejective].

          <text>!In the absence of F2-based contrasts, distinctiveness in F2 is irrelevant and minimization 
of effort becomes the key factor governing vowel backness and rounding.
!Least-effort vowel is essentially a smooth transition between preceding and following context (Colarusso 1988:307, Choi 1992).
!The same pattern is observed in English vowel reduction: when all vowel qualities areneutralized in unstressed syllables as in English, the result (schwa) is a vowel that
varies contextually around a high central quality (Flemming 2005).
10. The sensitivity of markedness to contrastive status cannot be accounted for in terms of
segment markedness constraints.
!The constraint ranking, * &gt;&gt; *u, *i , that would be required to account for the pattern of
preferences observed with back contrasts incorrectly implies that if only one of these
vowels appears, it should be [i] or [u], not a central vowel.

Co-occurrence restrictions on laryngeal features have various forms,which at rst glance seem to be contradictory. Assimilatory and dis-similatory restrictions are opposites  what is prohibited in one type oflanguage is precisely what is required in another. Mixed restriction lan-guages are particularly puzzling, because the antagonistic requirements toassimilate and dissimilate coexist in dierent corners of the same lan-guage. This puzzling array of restrictions is understandable if markednessconstraints evaluate contrasts between sets of roots in a language instead ofindividual forms.
The argument in this paper is that laryngeal co-occurrence restrictions
are a unied phenomenon, and are best understood when the perceptualproperties of laryngeal contrasts between roots are taken into account. The
paper presents experimental support for a hierarchy of perceptual dis-tinctness of laryngeal contrasts among roots, and develops an analysis oflaryngeal co-occurrence restrictions based on systemic markedness con-straints projected from this hierarchy. The central idea is that laryngealco-occurrence restrictions are not prohibitions against certain congura-tions of laryngeal features, but rather are restrictions on the perceptualdistinctness of contrasts among possible roots in a language. The operativeconstraints in laryngeal co-occurrence restrictions are not standardOptimality Theory (OT; Prince &amp; Smolensky 1993) markedness con-
straints. Rather, they are systemic constraints that evaluate the marked-
ness of the set of possible contrasts in a language. This approach followsmuch previous work integrating systemic contrast markedness intophonological theory, including Contrast Preservation Theory ( Kubowicz
2003) and the Dispersion Theory of Contrast (Flemming 1995, 2006,Padgett 2003, Sanders 2003, N Chiosa in &amp; Padgett 2009).
The paper is organised as follows. The typology of laryngeal co-
occurrence restrictions is laid out in w2, and w3 outlines the contrast
markedness approach to the phenomenon. w4 reports the results of a per-
ception experiment testing an individuals ability to distinguish laryngealcontrasts between pairs of roots. The analysis of laryngeal co-occurrence
restrictions with systemic markedness is given in w5, building on the re-
sults of the perception experiment. w6 compares the systemic markedness
approach with previous analyses of laryngeal restrictions, and w7 concludes.436 Gillian Gallagher

LARDIST(2v1)-[F] penalises a minimal contrast in a given laryngeal
feature between two roots each of which contains another segment speci-
ed for that feature. L ARDIST(1v0)-[F] is more general; it penalises a
minimal contrast in a given laryngeal feature between two roots each of
3LARDISTconstraints could also be formalised in the somewhat more familiar terms
of M INDIST(Flemming 1995, 2004). Under this formulation, laryngeal features are
dened as points on some auditory dimension, and systemic markedness constraints
require contrasting forms to dier in a certain amount on this dimension. Thedistance between an ejective and a plain stop is smaller in words with anotherejective than in words with another plain stop, and thus is penalised by a higher-
ranked M
INDISTconstraint.
LARDISTconstraints are formulated to refer only to roots. More general versions
of these constraints referring to the word may be necessary in languages that show
alternations. In Ofo (MacEachern 1999), a co-occurrence restriction on pairs ofaspirates triggers alternations, e.g. /osk ha+afha/E[oskaf ha] the white or American

          <text>Theory  21.1,  39-87.   
Appendix  on  [voice]  
Various  phonologists  (Iverson,  Ringen,  Jessen,  Vaux,  and  others) a  rgue  that the  Germanic  languages  
differ  in the  feature  that  contrasts  /p,t,k/  vs.  /b,d,g/:  English,  German [spread gl],  Dutch  [voice].  
This  position  is  critiqued  by  Kingston  and  Lahiri  (K&amp;L).  
	  proponents  of  [spread gl]  point  to the  fact  that  in man y contexts  there is  no phonetically 
observed voicing and therefore  this  is  prima  facie  evidence  that  [spread gl]  is  distinctive  
	  K&amp;L  term  this  an  essentialist  view  of  a  feature:  this  is  a  core  set  of  phonetic  correlates  that  
should  appear in  every re  alization  [F] o  f the  feature  (cf.  structuralists invariance  condition  
on phonemes) . They deny this, at least for [voice], claiming that a voicing contrast can be  
implemented  by  a  variety  of phonetic  gesture s whose d  istribution  and  magnitu de  vary  
according to  context  and  no  one gesture has  privileged  status.  What  unites  them  is  a  
perceptual  integration .  
	  voicing in  sonorants,  stops,  and  fricatives  is  phonetically diverse but  yet  they pattern  as  a 
natural  class  for  the  past  tense  and plural  allomorphs  in English  (assumes  z  and d are  not  the  
defaults).   
	  passive  voicing  is  really  actively  and purposely  produced  
	  perceptual  integration to give  an intermediate  perceptual  property IPP.  Performed  by  the  
auditory system  and  can  occur  even  when  sound  in  not  heard  as  speech : low frequency of  F0 
(and  F1) with  vocal  fold  vibration  and  duration  of  consonant  with  preceding vowel  duration.  
	  permits  a  more  abstract  view  of  a  distinctive  feature;  so apparently  VOT  will  integrate  with 
high F0  to  define  the  voiceless  value  signaling  the  open  glottis  gesture  in  the  adjacent  vowel.

          <text>EF sees this as a response to increased artic effort that would be required to realize vowels in 
shorter time span of unstressed syllables 
	 Chief evidence is that low vowel /a/ is raised to [ ]; this encroaches on the vowel space; if 
the same Min -Dist and Artic effort constraints that define the stressed vowel/lexical 
inventory are imposed , then the number of distinctions decreases since the grammar now 
chooses the five -vowel system

[5] Dispersion and enhancement (Flemming 2006) 
	 If dispersion constraints can freely interact with faithfulness and markedness constraints 
then the model over -generates: the inventory of contrasting segments should vary with 
context and targeted enhancement repair s should be able to rescue contrasts that are 
challenged by context (e.g. adding a schwa to final voiced obstruents) . Another problem is 
an infinite regress: the wellformedness of a candidate word [pad] might depend on whether or not [pat] is a possible word. But to determine whether [pat] is a possible word, we have 
to determine whether or not is statisfies MinDist constraints, requiring it to be adequately 
distinct from its nei ghbors, and so on. 
	 EFs claim is that we dont in general find these effects and the only response to a 
nonoptimal contrast is neutralization: in unstressed syllables distinctions are lost and the set 
of vowels shrinks rather than shifts (e.g. by introducing length); the only response to final 
voiced obstruents is devoicing (loss of contrast towards articulatorily less effortful sound) 
	 Proposal is to restrict the role of dispersion constraints to defining the phonemic inventory 
that encodes the lexicon and as a final quality check  on the output of the input -output 
mapping in the ESC (Evaluation of Surface Contrast) module ; in particular , dispersion 
constraints cannot interact with (be ranked with) the markedness and faithfulness 
constraints that define the input -output mapping .

          <text>24.961 Tone-1: African Languages 
1. Main theme 
 	 the study of tone in African lgs. raised serious conceptual problems for the
representation of the phoneme as a bundle of distinctive features. 
 	 the solution to the problem (autosegmental representations) became a model for
all other features 
 	 tone exhibits the widest range of phonological behavior, perhaps reflecting fact
that F0 is separated from rest of signal at an early point in auditory processing 
2. Phonetic correlates of tone 
 	 F0; stiffen and slacken vocal folds 
 	 typically realized on modal voicing 
 	 domain: often larger than single segment (syllable, word) 
 	 Tone-Bearing Unit: typically syllable, mora also possible (Lithuanian, Makua,Japanese); often spills over syllable boundary (peak delay) 
  often accompanied by voice quality features like creaky and breathy voice 
 	 can be affected by laryngeal features of adjacent consonants (tonogenesis) 
3. notation 
 	 Two-way contrast:  vs.  (or a) most Bantu languages 
 	 Three-way contrast: a vs. a (or a) vs.  (Yoruba, Buli syuk H 'path', syu k M
'navel', syk 'fish sp.' 
 	 Contours: a (rise) a (fall) 
 	 Features for H, M, L 
 	 Goldsmith: [+highpitch, -lowpitch], [-highpitch, -lowpitch], [-highpitch, +lowpitch] (3-way height contrast; cf. vowel height)  
 	 Yip: [+upper, -high], [-upper, +high], [-upper, -high] ([+upper, +high] for raisedH) (4-way height contrast) 
4. descriptive problems with tone motivating a novel conception of feature organization 
 	 decomposition of contour tones Rise into LH and Fall into HL 
 	 tonal melodies and tonal polarity 
5. Margi (Chadic, Nigeria): H, L, R (Williams 1973, Hoffmann 1963) 
 	 rising tone behaves phonologically as combination of Low plus High 
 	 derivational source from syllable coalescence

in a language with tonal melodies, the number of tonal contrasts does not increase
with the length of the lexical item; rather the melody is extended to encompass
additional syllables 
  tonal polarity: affix takes the opposite tone from the root: [tense-root-subject] 
 s g 'you go astray' 
 w g 'you run' 
 vl  g 'you fly'  
5. adding features of [rise], [fall] does not express the equivalence with LH and HL 
6. Goldsmith (1976) Autosegmental Phonology 
 	 tonal features are represented on a separate level ( tier) from segmental features 
 	 the temporal relation between the tonal tier and the segmental tier is represented
by association lines 
 	 rules of tonal phonology define and modify the associations as well as changing
the feature coefficients 
7. Margi analyzed autosegmentally 
devocalization 
u ? u - a r i u ? w - a r i -&gt;  u ? w - a r i segmental tier

H L   H L H L   H L           H      LH L tonal tier 
 	 tonal stability: while vowel deletes or devocalizes to a glide and hence loses its
ability to hold a tone, the tone does not disappear but is reassociated with anadjacent syllable 
8. Goldsmith's (1976) Well-Formedness Condition on autosegmental representations(rules apply to maximally satisfy it; early example of rules driven to satisfy a constraint) 
 	 every tone is associated with a tone-bearing unit (TBU = syllable, mora) 
 	 every tone-bearing unit is associated with a tone 
 	 association lines do not cross (for locality) 
9. 	Margi tonal melodies 
 	 verb roots belong to one of three tonal classes: H, L, LH

          <text>tones are associated with tone-bearing units (syllable) one-to- one, left-to-right 
 	 tones spread to satisfy the first condition of the WFC 
 	 tones associate to satisfy the second 
 	 implication that asymmetric location of plateux and contours should correlate 
 	 subsequent research fails to support this prediction 
 	 Zhang (UCLA diss) and others: contours prefer right edge of word; reflex of
phonetic duration in citation, phrase-final position 
8. Leben (1978): further work by Dweyer finds that LHH melody of Hausa ndvl 'sling'
is counter-exemplified by more numerous LLH of lsm 'amulet'. Leben suggests that H
is mapped to right edge for majority class while left-to-right is default

- Yoruba and Buli are three-tone languages: H, M, L
- the sandhi rules apply to tones at the F0-extremes
- tone sandhi rules are typically perseverative reflecting fact that F0 coarticulation
is normally delayed; cf. vowel height coarticulation, which is typically
anticipatory (Hyman 2006); cf. Italian metaphony

          <text>6  Words are parsed exhaustively into non -overlapping spans for each feature 
 Harmony is mot ivated by a constraint against adjacent spans for a particular feature  
 *Ajacent -Span(F): assign one violation mark for every pair of adjacent spans for feature F  
 Basic harmony ranking: *Aj -Span[F]   Faith -Head [F] root  Faith -Head [F]  
  Tangale (contd)  
/kuk-k / *Aj-Span[ATR]  Faith -Head [ATR] root Faith -Head[ ATR] 
&gt; [k ukko]   * 
[kuk][k] *!   
[kkk]  *!  
 Directionality can be analyzed by constraints requiring left - or right -headed spans

&gt;[][n][-m][arak a]  **** **** 
[][n] -[mr k] ***  *** 
[][ad][e-baraka]  ***  *** 
 
 Blocking arises from feature co-occurrence constraints on span heads  that require  the 
combination of features that fail to harmonize to appear in the head of a  span 
-Head -ATR[+low ]: a low vowel must head an ATR span  
- blocks extension of the domain to include the low vowel  in Tangale

[12] Application to Wilsons conundrums  
 On the assumption that every segment belongs to a span then extending the harm onic 
domain minimizes the number of *Adjacent Span viola tions and hence spreading up to the 
site of the opaque segment is preferred to not doing so  
 illustration with Nasal harmony  
 Walker (1998) notices that there is a cross -linguistic hierarchy on blockers of nasality 
spread that correlates with nasalizability; she expresses this as a markedness hierarchy  
  *b &gt; *s &gt;*r &gt; *w   &gt; *a  
 McCarthy expresses the  hierarchy with requirement that these segments head oral spans  
 Every Stop heads an oral span  
 Every Fricative heads an oral span 
  : 
 Every Vowel heads an oral span  
 Harmony arises from ranking the ban on adjacent nasal spans within this hierarchy  
 So in Malay *Adj-Span[nasal]  ranks above the constraint promoting glides and vowels as 
oral spans but below  the constraint promoting liquid oral spans

          <text>5  With Agree there is a tie between maximal extension of  the harmonic domain up to the 
neutral vowel and  more minimal extension s: [+ATR] [+ATR] [ ATR] vs. : 
[+ATR] [ ATR] [ ATR]; each results in a single disharmonic transition and so 
faithfulness should favor the  minimal change1 
 But this is incorrect: harmo ny extends up to the opaque vowel  
 Also Agree cannot handle directionality : all vowels in a stem should either agree or not; 
no partial spans  as in Malay p wsan 
[10] Align -[F]  
 Harmonic feature is aligned with the left/right edge of the domain (word) by multiple 
association of the feature; penalize all segments not associated with the harmonic

the domain

 Like Agree , it optimizes by minimizing the number of dis harmonic segments and so  it 
could be satisfied by deleting segments to shorten the domain or blocking epenthesis in a harmonic domain but letting it apply elsewhere  
[11] Spans (McCarthy 2004)
2 
 Span is defined as a sequence of segments associated with the s ame autosegment  
 The head of a span is the segment corresponding to the origin of harmony in the input ; it 
is associated with a faithfulness constraint for that feature  
                                                   
1 This is sometimes called sour grapes meaning that if the rule cannot be completely satisfied, 
then it will fail to apply at all.

7] For OT harmony poses several challenges  
 what is tri gger motivating the harm onic change?  
 what is the domain? How is directionality expressed?   
 how are opaque and neu tral vowels accounted for ?  
8] Agree constraints (Bakovic 2000)  
 Harmony  is motiv ated by a constraint requiring A greement for a feature [F] between 
vowels in adjacent syllables  in a domain  such as the word  
 Conflict resolved by positional faithfulness to root, initial, final, or stressed vowel  
 Opaque vowel reflects a feature co -occurrence restriction

 [13] motivations for harmony    
 perceptual magnification of a feature (Walker 2005, Kaun 1995, 2004)  
 extending a feature over a longer domain presumably enhances the perceptibility of that 
feature  
 segments that are less distinct for a feature may preferentially disprefer to either undergo 
or trigger harmony  
 Kaun (2004) observes that labiality (F2) is less pronounced in a lower vowel like [o] in comparison to [u]; in Turkish labial harmony targets just high vowels while backness 
harmony targets both high and nonhigh  vowels  
 in Western Mongolian non -high round vowels are restricted to first syllable ; also there is 
no spread of [round ] to later syllables , unlike in Turkish 
 parsing: extending a feature across a word makes pairs of words more distinct (Gallagher 2010)  
 articulatory motivation : (rapid) shifts from [+F] to [ F] may require more effort than 
leaving th e articulator in a single state  
[15] Transparency  
 Typically consonants are  transparent for vowel harmony features unless they are specified 
for features that are incompatible with the spreading feature such as palatality (high F2) and pharyngealization (low F2)  in Arabic (Davis 1995) .  
 vowels can be transparent for some consonantal features such as [ anterior ] in sibilant 
harmony; but in some cases the vowel might really be retroflexed  but with minimal or no 
auditory effect.   
 genuine transparency : the neutral  vowels in Finnish and Hungarian and voic eless s tops in 
nasal harmony languages  
 how to treat these cases remains an outstanding problem</text>

- in four -syllable word s a lexical accent on the second syllable can survive 
since both extend ed lapse constraints are satisfied; but when the word is five 
syllables there is an extended lapse on the right and so a violation occurs  
- the candidate with accent placed in the middle of word satisfies both 
extended lapse constraints 
- But the window is regained when the word is longer than five syllables  since 
now among the competing candidates every word will violate one or the 
other of Extended Lapse constraints and hence there is a tie that will be 
resolved by the lower- ranked faithfulness or alignment c onstraints  In a four syllable form, the same ranking restricts stress to the middle two syllables; in a three syllable form no restrictions
are imposed on the realization of lexical stress.

The key insight to emerge from this discussion of midpoint pathology is that the primary stress should not be controlled
by a pair of high-ranked opposite-edge window constraints. These constraints can be simultaneously satisfied in forms of
five syllables, trapping the primary stress on the middle syllable. This conclusion will be reinforced in section 4.2by a
discussion of a model with edge-oriented anti-lapse constraints.
In sum, the central problem identified for the maximally binary foot model plus extrametricality is that it
undergenerates the typology of three syllable windows. Several attempts at repairing the binary foot model forwindows failed for different reasons. First, an account based on P
ARSE -2 (Green, 1995 ) is flawed by undergeneration
as well as overgeneration; additional assumptions needed to solve these defects only introduced new problems.
Second, an attempt at hard-wiring the peripher ality condition on extrametrical syllables ( Baerman, 1998 )f a i l st o
account for initial three syllable windows, since as soon as extrametricality becomes symmetrical, the tableaux
become formally undecidable. Third, a proposal by Hyde (2008) overcomes the undergeneration problem, yet this
model suffers from an overgeneration problem: it cannot altogether avoid midpoint pathology. The insight thatextrametricality-based models with binary feet cannot account for stress windows naturally leads to a shift in theattention to different mechanisms: anti-lapse constraintsa n dt e r n a r yf o o tm o d e l s ,w h i c hw i l lb ed i s c u s s e di ns e c t i o n s

1983; Selkirk, 1984 ). In an edge-based model,
that target lapses specifically in word
2002 ). Below, three configurations of grids
A final three syllable window system has a high-ranked constraint banning extended lapse at the right edge, while a
final two syllable window systems bans regular lapse at the right
edge. To account for the symmetrical
maximal window
size of three syllables, anti-lapse constraints that target extended lapses must be assumed for both edges.
The specific implementation of this mechanism will be a pure grid (PG) model, adapted from Gordon (2002). Gordon /uni02C8s
original set was simplified by eliminating constraints that are exclusively relevant for iterative stress. The resulting modelhas the following constraint set.R. Kager / Lingua 122 (2012) 1454 --1493 1478
extended lapse constraints, while in words of three syllables long, placing stress on any syllable will satisfy both anti-lapse
constraints simultaneously. This predicts window systems in which stress is free to fall on any syllable in a three syllableword, on the second or third in four syllable words, but may only occur on the third syllable in five syllable words. This
window pattern is a specimen of /uni02C8Midpoint Pathology /uni02C8(Eisner, 1997; Hyde, 2008 :4), /uni02C8a collection of situations where an
object is drawn toward a medial position in a form /uni02C8.

Strikingly, words longer than five syllables regain their accentual freedom: since the two high-ranking anti-lapse
constraints can no longer both be satisfied, one must give way, and F AITH-ACCENT jumps into activity again. This restores
the initial three syllable stress window:

The factorial typology of the constraint set for pure grids contains 254 window patterns in which stress in five syllable
words is fixed on the middle syllable, with shorter words and/or longer words obeying a window. Among these, 175 show fixed
midpoint stress in five syllable words, while shorter and longer words have accentual freedom within a window (of two or threesyllables, in initial or final position). The most severe cases are of the following kind: an (initial or final) window of two syllables
is imposed on longer words, i.e. a window size defeated by the fixed midpoint stress in five syllable forms.
6
Additional pathological window patterns arise by specific interactions of anti-lapse constraints targeting lapses of different
sizes. For example, the high-ranked combination *L APSE-L  *E XTENDED -LAPSE-R generates a window system in which words
of all lengths are subject to an initial two syllable domain, except that four syllable words have fixed stress on the antepenult.
Table (42) displays window reductions for all logically possible combinations of anti-lapse constraints for words of lengths oftwo to seven syllables. The stress windows are indicated by square brackets. In each cell, the stress patterns are listed thatarise under a specific ranking of a pair of anti-lapse constraints. This ranking has anti-lapse constraint in the vertical
dimension as the higher-ranked one, and the anti-lapse constraint in the horizontal dimension as the lower-ranked one:R. Kager / Lingua 122 (2012) 1454 --1493 1480
6To be sure, window systems are attested in which the degree of accentual freedom is correlated with syllable number, without showing
Midpoint Pathology. For example, the pitch accent in Kyungsang Korean ( Kenstowicz and Sohn, 2001 ) is restricted by a final two syllable window
in words of two or three syllables, whereas accent is fixed on the penult in words of four or more syllables. This is not a case of Midpoint Pathology,
as five syllable words are not accented on the middle syllables; moreover, longer words (exceeding four syllables) do not regain accentualfreedom. Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.Kager, Ren. Stress in Windows: Language Typology and Factorial Typology. Lingua 122, no. 13

          <text>Elas-Ulloa (2005) analyzes these patterns using a strictly disyllabic foot, adjusting the weight of an initial closed syllable
preceding another closed syllable to (L H) by means of Weight-to-Stress and Grouping Harmony (Prince, 1990). This weight
adjustment is independently supported by a suffixal allomorphy that is sensitive to odd/even parity count, treating closed
syllables as light in odd positions (see Vaysman, 2009 for an analysis). Assuming that the disyllabic foot-based analysis iscorrect and also that it can be generalized to Capanahua, these languages no longer constitute evidence for a mixed default.
For the third S/I language in StressTyp, Mathimathi (Hercus, 1969), quantity-sensitivity is likely to be spurious.
Goedemans (1997) shows that Mathimathi stress is entirely morphologically governed; the appearance of typologicallyuncommon quantity criteria is due to historical phonological processes targeting stems of specific lengths.
All three P/U languages listed in StressTyp are Austronesian: Javanese, Malay, and Ngada, and their status in stress
typology is problematic. For Javanese, the status of word stress is controversial and descriptions are not uniform (Horne,1961; Poedjosoedarmo, 1982; Ras, 1985). In the Indonesian spoken by native speakers of Javanese, no systematic
phonetic correlates of stress have been found. Moreover, stress seems not to be perceived by Javanese listeners: the
manipulation of pitch contours of final and prefinal syllables failed to result in different perceptions (Goedemans and vanZanten, 2007). For varieties of Malay, the situation appears to be no less complex (van Zanten et al., 2003; Roosman,
2006; Zuraidah et al., 2008). Finally, Ngad a is most probably miscategorized among P/U systems since schwa does not
occur in the final syllable according to Arndt (1933). For these reasons, it seems rather premature to claim the existence ofP/U systems with mixed defaults. In sum, the evidence for opposite defaults in the form of S/I and P/U systems is ratherweak. No compelling arguments remain for the existence of stress windows with non-uniform default systems.
Finally, consider languages that have hierarchies for intrinsic prominence (e.g. a syllable weight scale). Weight
hierarchies are well-known for unbounded stress languages (such as Kelkhar's Hindi and Kashmiri; Prince andSmolensky, 1993). In case a weight scale system also imposes a stress window, the primary stress falls on the heaviest
syllable occurring within the window -- a weight peak. In case there is not a single weight peak, but two or three peaks
compete for attracting stress, the choice among these is made per default, similarly to languages with a binary weightcontrast. For example, Piraha (Muran; Everett and Everett, 1984) has a final three syllable window in which stress is
predictable according to a syllable weight hierarchy in (15):
Stress falls on the heaviest of the last three syllables in the word. In the representations below, the stress window has
been marked by square brackets.

The default stress position in Piraha is rightmost. This is evidenced by windows that contain more than a single
heaviest syllable (i.e. a tie), in which case the rightmost of these is stressed.

Elas-Ulloa (2005) analyzes these patterns using a strictly disyllabic foot, adjusting the weight of an initial closed syllable
preceding another closed syllable to (L H) by means of Weight-to-Stress and Grouping Harmony (Prince, 1990). This weight
adjustment is independently supported by a suffixal allomorphy that is sensitive to odd/even parity count, treating closed
syllables as light in odd positions (see Vaysman, 2009 for an analysis). Assuming that the disyllabic foot-based analysis iscorrect and also that it can be generalized to Capanahua, these languages no longer constitute evidence for a mixed default.
For the third S/I language in StressTyp, Mathimathi (Hercus, 1969), quantity-sensitivity is likely to be spurious.
Goedemans (1997) shows that Mathimathi stress is entirely morphologically governed; the appearance of typologicallyuncommon quantity criteria is due to historical phonological processes targeting stems of specific lengths.
All three P/U languages listed in StressTyp are Austronesian: Javanese, Malay, and Ngada, and their status in stress
typology is problematic. For Javanese, the status of word stress is controversial and descriptions are not uniform (Horne,1961; Poedjosoedarmo, 1982; Ras, 1985). In the Indonesian spoken by native speakers of Javanese, no systematic
phonetic correlates of stress have been found. Moreover, stress seems not to be perceived by Javanese listeners: the
manipulation of pitch contours of final and prefinal syllables failed to result in different perceptions (Goedemans and vanZanten, 2007). For varieties of Malay, the situation appears to be no less complex (van Zanten et al., 2003; Roosman,
2006; Zuraidah et al., 2008). Finally, Ngad a is most probably miscategorized among P/U systems since schwa does not
occur in the final syllable according to Arndt (1933). For these reasons, it seems rather premature to claim the existence ofP/U systems with mixed defaults. In sum, the evidence for opposite defaults in the form of S/I and P/U systems is ratherweak. No compelling arguments remain for the existence of stress windows with non-uniform default systems.
Finally, consider languages that have hierarchies for intrinsic prominence (e.g. a syllable weight scale). Weight
hierarchies are well-known for unbounded stress languages (such as Kelkhar's Hindi and Kashmiri; Prince andSmolensky, 1993). In case a weight scale system also imposes a stress window, the primary stress falls on the heaviest
syllable occurring within the window -- a weight peak. In case there is not a single weight peak, but two or three peaks
compete for attracting stress, the choice among these is made per default, similarly to languages with a binary weightcontrast. For example, Piraha (Muran; Everett and Everett, 1984) has a final three syllable window in which stress is
predictable according to a syllable weight hierarchy in (15):

          <text>4 extended lapse constraints, while in words of three syllables long, placing stress on any syllable will satisfy both anti-lapse
constraints simultaneously. This predicts window systems in which stress is free to fall on any syllable in a three syllableword, on the second or third in four syllable words, but may only occur on the third syllable in five syllable words. This
window pattern is a specimen of /uni02C8Midpoint Pathology /uni02C8(Eisner, 1997; Hyde, 2008 :4), /uni02C8a collection of situations where an
object is drawn toward a medial position in a form /uni02C8.

Strikingly, words longer than five syllables regain their accentual freedom: since the two high-ranking anti-lapse
constraints can no longer both be satisfied, one must give way, and F AITH-ACCENT jumps into activity again. This restores
the initial three syllable stress window:
(62)
[TD$INLINE]
The factorial typology of the constraint set for pure grids contains 254 window patterns in which stress in five syllable
words is fixed on the middle syllable, with shorter words and/or longer words obeying a window. Among these, 175 show fixed
midpoint stress in five syllable words, while shorter and longer words have accentual freedom within a window (of two or threesyllables, in initial or final position). The most severe cases are of the following kind: an (initial or final) window of two syllables
is imposed on longer words, i.e. a window size defeated by the fixed midpoint stress in five syllable forms.
6
Additional pathological window patterns arise by specific interactions of anti-lapse constraints targeting lapses of different
sizes. For example, the high-ranked combination *L APSE-L  *E XTENDED -LAPSE-R generates a window system in which words
of all lengths are subject to an initial two syllable domain, except that four syllable words have fixed stress on the antepenult.
Table (42) displays window reductions for all logically possible combinations of anti-lapse constraints for words of lengths oftwo to seven syllables. The stress windows are indicated by square brackets. In each cell, the stress patterns are listed thatarise under a specific ranking of a pair of anti-lapse constraints. This ranking has anti-lapse constraint in the vertical
dimension as the higher-ranked one, and the anti-lapse constraint in the horizontal dimension as the lower-ranked one:R. Kager / Lingua 122 (2012) 1454 --1493 1480
6To be sure, window systems are attested in which the degree of accentual freedom is correlated with syllable number, without showing
Midpoint Pathology. For example, the pitch accent in Kyungsang Korean ( Kenstowicz and Sohn, 2001 ) is restricted by a final two syllable window
in words of two or three syllables, whereas accent is fixed on the penult in words of four or more syllables. This is not a case of Midpoint Pathology,
as five syllable words are not accented on the middle syllables; moreover, longer words (exceeding four syllables) do not regain accentualfreedom. Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.

A stress window occurs when a Weakly Layered foot is obligatorily aligned with a domain edge. A two syllable window
results when the adjunct is disallowed, and hence, the head is doubly aligned with both foot edges.
(65) Two syllable windows: adjunct disallowed
a. final window b. initial window
U ([  /uni02C8]) # ([ /uni02C8]) # I # ([ /uni02C8]) # ([ /uni02C8])
P ([ /uni02C8]) # S # ([  /uni02C8])
Observe that the contrast of peripheral versus non-peripheral stress may arise either by manipulating the head's
dominance (trochaic versus iambic), or its size (binary versus unary). Technically, this involves a ranking of a DPS
constraint above a foot form constraint.
A three syllable window emerges when an adjunct is allowed in the weakly layered foot, so that the head may be mis-
aligned with one (but not both) foot edges. As compared to two syllable windows, the number of representationalpossibilities for non-peripheral stress increases. For each non-peripheral stress position, four representational optionsoccur, as shown below.
(66) Three syllable windows: adjunct allowed
a. final window
U ([ /uni02C8]) # ([  /uni02C8]) # ( [ /uni02C8]) # ( [/uni02C8])
P ([ /uni02C8]) # ([  /uni02C8])# ( [/uni02C8]) # ([ /uni02C8])

b. initial windowI # ([ /uni02C8]) # ([ /uni02C8]) # ([ /uni02C8]) # ([ /uni02C8])
S # ([  /uni02C8]) # ( [/uni02C8]) # ([  /uni02C8])# ( [/uni02C8])
T# ( [ /uni02C8])
Observe that the three-way stress contrast is representationally encoded as variation in four aspects of foot form: head
dominance, head size, head alignment, and foot size. Evidently, foot form variation is not random, but under control of
constraint interaction. Crucially, a weakly layered foot model of stress windows should not be combined with extrametricality
(of the final syllable unparsability type) as this would incorrectly predict four syllable window systems. (See Everett, 1988 :233
for a similar argument based on Piraha .) However, non-finality can be assumed as an unstressability requirement.
The following constraint set will be assumed:
(67) Constraint set for the Weakly Layered Model
a. H
D-BIN Heads are binary under syllabic or moraic analysis.
b. A LIGN-HD-L Heads are left-aligned with feet.
c. A LIGN-HD-R Heads are right-aligned with feet.
d. H D=TROCHEE Heads begin with strong syllable.
e. H D=IAMB Heads begin with weak syllable.
f. P ARSE-SYL Syllables are parsed by feet.
g. A LIGN-WORD-L Words are left-aligned with a foot.
h. A LIGN-WORD-R Words are right-aligned with a foot.
i. N ON-FINALITY Stress must not fall on the final syllable.
j. F AITH-ACCENT A lexical accent should be realized as primary stress.
HD-BINis the counterpart of F T-BINin the binary model, and it is evaluated analogously. Analogously to assumptions
made earlier for the binary foot model, a monosyllabic head violates H D=IAMB, but not H D=TROCHEE . The Weakly Layered
Model has no constraints requiring peripheral syllables to be non-parsed by a foot, as in the binary foot model; the onlyconstraint referring to the final syllable requires its unstressability: N
ON-FINALITY . To determine the side of the adjunct
with respect to the head, a pair of head-to-foot alignment constraints (67b--c) are assumed. In case both constraints arehigh-ranked, the adjunct is suppressed, in which case the size of the foot equals the size of its head (i.e. maximally twoR.

Thus, free -ranking of natural const r aints predicts an unattested stress system  in the typology . 
[5] The problem is not just limited to lexical accent but can arise more generally in any system 
where the two opposite -edge lapse constraints dominate alignment  (Stanton 2014); stress is 
drawn to middle of word just in case it can remove lapses at both edges; but in longer words this 
is not possible and so the default edge orientation will reassert itself

[6] Kagers suggested solution is to represent  the two and three -syllable windows with a  weakly -
layered foo t: a ternary foo t with a single binary foot inside . Nonfinality is restricted to final 
unstressability.

- Gen is hard -wired to only allow a single adjunct syllable on either the left or 
right edge of foot and the internal head foot is restricted to two syllables (cf. foot

- amounts to binary feet with at most  one recursion 
- Ito &amp; Mester (2012) propose similar restrictions on the depth of recursion in phrasal

4.1  Metrically conditioned tone in Chugach Alutiiq  
In 3 we placed Chugach Alutiiq among the mixed ter nary/binary systems on the rhythmic continuum: 
ternary feet are overall preferred to binary feet; the latter arise only to satisfy exhaustivity and a void 
unary feet (46). Here we provide evidence supportin g this proposal based on the distribution of tones. 
The data in (56) illustrates the tonal patterns in words with all light syllables. Leer (1985c) report s that 
syllables can exhibit one of three different tonal patterns: they can bear a high tone (H), a low tone  (L) 
or, under specific circumstances, do not receive a particular tone; the pitch of these syllables depends 
on tones of neighboring syllables (Leer 1985c: 164). Importantly, Chugach tone is not lexically 
specified, but its distribution is determined exclu sively by metrical structure (Leer 1985c, Hewitt 
1991, Rice 1992, Martnez-Paricio 2013). 
(56) 
!
As can be seen from ( 5
6), stressed syllables are always high, and some of them are up-stepped (H). H 
is up-stepped when it is preceded by another H and there is no intervening low between the two highs 
(56c). The attraction of high tones to stressed syl lables (i.e. foot heads) is common in mixed prosodi c 
systems with tone and stress (e.g. Goldsmith 1987; Bickmore 1995; de Lacy 2002, 2006). Likewise, 
the up-stepping of a H when preceded by another H (e.g. HH " HH) is common in the literature of 
tone and intonation (Goldsmith 1976; Pierrehumbert 1980; Yip 2002; Gussenhoven 2004, etc.) and 
can be easily captured by a simple rule or via cons traint interaction. What is puzzling in Chugach is 
the distribution of low tones: while some unstresse d syllables are assigned a L (e.g. the third syllab le 
in 56a), other unstressed syllables do not receive a particular tone, their pitch being an interpolati on 
between neighboring tones (e.g. the fourth syllable  in 56a,b). If one only considers the data in (56), a 
non-structural stress-based explanation for the dis tribution of tones could be proposed. Namely, it 
could be argued that a low tone docks onto every po st-stress syllable that is not immediately followed  
by a high tone. This approach would derive the corr ect tonal distributions in words with light syllables 
28 
 (56a-d). However, when words with heavy syllables a re taken into consideration, the stress-based 
account proves inadequate, being unable to predict the presence or absence of low tones. This is 
shown in (57), where we provide the tonal patterns of two words with heavy syllables. These words 
have similar length (both are trisyllabic) and stre ss occurs on exactly the same syllables (i.e. the f irst 
and third). Still, they differ in their tonal melod ies: in (57a) the second syllable bears a low tone,  
whereas the second syllable in (57b) does not. 
(57) Tone patterns in Chugach Alutiiq words with li ght and heavy syllables 
 
 
A strictly stress-bas e
d account of the distribution  o f  t o n e s  i n  C h u g a c h  f a i l s  t o  c a p t u r e  t h e  t o n a l  
differences between these two forms, since stress f alls on the same syllables, yet their pitch pattern s 
are different. However, the tonal difference betwee n unstressed syllables in (57a) vs. (57b) can be 
straightforwardly captured within a model that allo ws reference to recursive metrical structure. In 
particular, we propose that Chugach  and possibly other languages as well (see 4.3) exploits a 
distinction between two types of foot dependents: ( i) the dependent of a FtMin and (ii) the dependent 
of a FtNon-min. More specifically, in Chugach a low  tone only docks onto an unstressed syllable that 
is directly dominated by a FtNon-min, whereas no sp ecific tone is assigned to immediate dependents 
of FtMin. This analysis is illustrated below in (58 ) and (59). Remember from 3 that forms with light 
syllables contain IL feet in 3n+2 (58a), 3 n (3b, 3d) and 3 n+1 syllable forms, as long as the latter do 
not contain an even number of syllables (cf. 58c). Note that this analysis correctly predicts that in the

Heavy syllables " in Chugach, those containing a diphthong or a long  vowel, and a CVC syllable in 
word-initial position " always attract stress and hence, slightly alter th e basic footing. For details on 28 
 (56a-d). However, when words with heavy syllables a re taken into consideration, the stress-based 
account proves inadequate, being unable to predict the presence or absence of low tones. This is 
shown in (57), where we provide the tonal patterns of two words with heavy syllables. These words 
have similar length (both are trisyllabic) and stre ss occurs on exactly the same syllables (i.e. the f irst 
and third). Still, they differ in their tonal melod ies: in (57a) the second syllable bears a low tone,  
whereas the second syllable in (57b) does not.

differences between these two forms, since stress f alls on the same syllables, yet their pitch pattern s 
are different. However, the tonal difference betwee n unstressed syllables in (57a) vs. (57b) can be 
straightforwardly captured within a model that allo ws reference to recursive metrical structure. In 
particular, we propose that Chugach  and possibly other languages as well (see 4.3) exploits a 
distinction between two types of foot dependents: ( i) the dependent of a FtMin and (ii) the dependent 
of a FtNon-min. More specifically, in Chugach a low  tone only docks onto an unstressed syllable that 
is directly dominated by a FtNon-min, whereas no sp ecific tone is assigned to immediate dependents 
of FtMin. This analysis is illustrated below in (58 ) and (59). Remember from 3 that forms with light 
syllables contain IL feet in 3n+2 (58a), 3 n (3b, 3d) and 3 n+1 syllable forms, as long as the latter do 
not contain an even number of syllables (cf. 58c). Note that this analysis correctly predicts that in the 
absence of IL feet, no low tones will occur in a wo rd (58c).

 the recursion-based analysis of Chugach quantity-se nsitive stress, the reader is referred to Martnez-
Paricio (2013), which builds heavily on Leer (1985) , Rice (1992) and Kager (1993). What is important 
for the present discussion is that (i) Chugach feet  a r e  m o r a i c  a n d  i a m b i c  a n d  ( i i )  h e a v y  s y l l a b l e s  
constitute an iambic foot of their own.15 T h e s e  t w o  a s s u m p t i o n s  e x p l a i n  w h y  f o r m s  w i t h  t h e  s ame 
number of syllables and stress pattern, but differe nt number of morae like [ta !a.ta. !qa] my father (59a) 
and [ !an.ci.qu !a]  Ill go out (59b), display differences in footing , leading to differences in their tones. 
As illustrated in (59a), the form [ta !a.ta. !qa] contains an initial heavy syllable, which proje cts its own 
minimal bimoraic foot. Since the second and third s yllables are light, they are grouped into another 
bimoraic foot. The construction of a ternary foot would have instead left the final syllable unparsed or 
a degenerate foot, but none of these options are al lowed in Chugach  (Leer 1985 c). Next, [ !an.ci.qu! a] 
(59b) contains two heavy syllables (the first and t hird), each projecting a bimoraic foot. To avoid 
degenerate feet and non-exhaustivity, the third mor a is adjoined to the preceding foot, resulting in a n 
IL ternary foot. Once their metrical structure is c onsidered, we can understand why these forms 
display different tonal patterns: [(ta !aH)(ta !qa H)] (63a) does not present any instance of recursion  and, 
hence, no low tone occurs; in contrast, in [((! anH)ciL)(qu !aH)] (63b), an IL foot is aligned with the left 
edge of the prosodic word and, consequently, the dependent of the non-minimal foot surfaces with a 
low tone.  
(59) Forms with heavy syllables    
 
Detr  which the second 
sylla
ble in (59b) is left unparsed. Low tones would then only dock onto unfooted syllables (e.g. Hayes  
1995:345). However, as Hayes (1995:343) acknowledge s, this proposal fails to explain why a form 
like (59b) favors a parsing [( !an) ci (qu !a)] over [( !an)(ci.qu! a)], given that the uneven iamb in the latter 
form is less marked from a typological perspective.  T h e  r e c u r s i o n - b a s e d  a c c o u n t  i s  p r e f e r a b l e  t o  a  
WLP analysis in yet another respect. Leer reports t hat stressed vowels are generally lengthened in 
open syllables. Interestingly, he notes a subtle du rational difference among the lengthened vowels: 
some of them are longer than the others. For instan ce, when comparing the duration of the second 
syllables in aktaq kind of food and aktamk kind of food (abl. sg.), Leer states: the syllab le ku 
is lengthened in both cases, but u is longer in akutaq  (1985c:164). This durational difference between 
the two words is relatively straightforward if one considers their respective metrical structures: in 
[((a. !ku) taq)] /u/ is more prominent than in [(a. !ku) (ta. !mek)] because only the former has a double-</text>

The IL foot respects locality , due to adjacency of the head and its dependent at  both levels of structure. 
Although the top level dependents of the IL dactyl ((10)0) and anapest (0(01)) are not linearly adjace nt 
to the head syllable, what matters for locality is that the dependents are adjacent to the innermost f oot. 
The IL foot is equally local in its vertical  dimension: an upper bound of two layers of structu re. 
Since headedness varies at two levels, four IL feet  arise: a dactyl ((10)0), two amphibrachs ((01)0) a nd 
(0(10)) and an anapest (0(01)). Importantly, all fo ur types are typologically attested. The dactyl ((1 0)0) 
occurs in Tripura Bangla and Cayuvava:

   penult or antepenult, but not the final syllable, can be stressed. Such systems are well attested, most famously in Latin
(section 2), which has a quantity-based reduced three syllable window.
A reduced three syllable window system with lexical accent occurs in Central Western Macedonian ( Vidoeski, 1985 ; as
reported in Baerman, 1999 :16)
In nouns and adjectives, lexical specification of stress within the stem has been largely eliminated, with stress
falling on the penultimate syllable of the Lexical Word [ ...]. This accentuation is maintained in the definite forms, so
that in these forms stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable [ ...]. The only exceptions to this pattern are some
nouns where stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable of the LexWd, whereby preantepenultimate stress wouldbe expected in the definite form. Some dialects allow this [ ...] while in others stress shifts to the antepenultimate
syllable in the definite form [ ...]
The following examples show a stem tongue with regular stress (penult in the indefinite, antepenult in the definite),
next to another stem Saturday with irregular stress (antepenultimate in both forms):
(29) regular pattern irregular pattern
a. e./uni02C8 zi.tsi tongues-
INDEF  c. /uni02C8sa.bo.ta Saturday- INDEF 
b. e./uni02C8 zi.tsi.te tongues- DEF  d. sa. /uni02C8bo.ta.ta Saturday- DEF 
Interestingly, exclusions of the final syllable also occur in initial window systems. Examples are Hopi (two syllable
window) and Azkoitia Basque (three syllable window).
Hopi (Uto-Aztecan; Jeanne, 1982 ) has a mixed lexical accent/quantity-based window system. Accent, manifested as
high tone, is quantity-sensitive. It regularly falls on the second syllable (30a--b), or on the initial syllable if this is heavy
(30c--d). Disyllables must have initial accent even if the first syllable is light (30e). Exceptional initial accent may occur inwords longer than two syllables (30f).

c. /uni02C8paa.wits.ja duck  f. /uni02C8si.kis.ve car 
d. /uni02C8sip.mas.mi silver bracelet 
Two more examples of initial two syllable window systems that impose final unstressability are On ati Basque, which
has lexical pitch accent ( Hualde, 1999 ), and Aranda (Australian; Strehlow, 1942; Davis, 1988), which is based on syllable
weight (the presence of syllable onsets).
Turning now to initial three syllable windows constrained by non-finality, we already discussed a mixed lexical accent
plus syllable weight system, that of Terna, in section 2. An example of a purely accentual system is Azkoitia Basque
(Hualde, accent in words longer than two syllables:

b. /on/ good 
/uni02C8o.na the good one- ABS 
...
Observe that strict non-finality has priority over (default) non-initiality (/ /uni02C8o.na/ the good one , */o. /uni02C8na/).
The accentual pattern of bisyllabic forms such as ona the good one shows that when the application of both
extrametricality conditions would make the whole domain unaccentuable, initial extrametricality is revoked.
Expressed in terms of ranked constraints, nonfinality is ranked above noninitiality. (Hualde, 1998:108)
That is, on an analysis that attributes default third syllable stress to initial extrametricality (rendering the initial syllable
unparsable), and final unstressability to final extrametricality (unparsability), the former must overrule the latter. Thisranking similarly applies to Hopi seen above, on the analysis that second syllable stress is due to initial unparsability.R. Kager / Lingua 122 (2012) 1454 --1493 1467
pathological pattern: in words of two or three syllables, stress is free to fall on any syllable, whereas in longer words, stress is
restricted to fall on a non-peripheral syllable. In (49), a candidate with a right-aligned iamb satisfies L APSE/PARSE-2, hence
lexical accent determines the outcome because F AITH-ACCENT dominates the default constraints.
(49)

In longer forms of four (or more) syllables, violation of L APSE/PARSE-2 will be minimal: since any candidate with a strictly
aligned foot incurs one more violation of L APSE/PARSE-2 than a candidate with a non-aligned foot, an /uni02C8internal /uni02C8window
emerges that restricts stress to fall on any syllable that heads a non-peripheral foot.

In order to avoid midpoint pathology, a stronger assumption is needed, that single-foot metrical systems are universally
excluded, setting up tacit feet in metrical systems that lack overt secondary stresses. This implies that metrification is
universally exhaustive. However, this account immediately backfires on the proposal for ternary stress windows, as it renders
the explanatory mechanism, based on a constraint that penalizes sequences of unparsed syllables, simply vacuous. (A
further problem concerning the factorial typology of P ARSE-2 related to ternary stress is discussed by Elenbaas and Kager,
1999 .)
A recent attempt to analyze three syllable windows by means of binary feet was made by Hyde (2008). To account for
the final three syllable window of Macedonian, Hyde assumes that syllables are exhaustively parsed into feet, and that feetcan be without stress. The constraint to enforce the window, F
INALWINDOW , disallows a configuration in the prosodic word in
which the primary stress (grid mark at word level, abbreviated as x v) is followed by a foot, with a syllable intervening.

This restricts primary stress to the syllable immediately preceding the final foot, or to any syllable that itself is part of the

lexical accent determines the outcome because F AITH-ACCENT dominates the default constraints.

          <text>(64) Shapes of the Weakly Layered foot
[TD$INLINE]head + adjunct adjunct + head no adjunct
binary head, trochee ([' ] ( )  [' ]) ([' ])
binary head, iamb ([  ' ] ( )  [  ' ]) ([  ' ])
unary head ([' ] ( )  [']) ([' ])
A stress window occurs when a Weakly Layered foot is obligatorily aligned with a domain edge. A two syllable window
results when the adjunct is disallowed, and hence, the head is doubly aligned with both foot edges.
(65) Two syllable windows: adjunct disallowed
a. final window b. initial window
U ([  ]) # ([ ]) # I # ([ ]) # ([ ])
P ([ ]) # S # ([  ])
Observe that the contrast of peripheral versus non-peripheral stress may arise either by manipulating the head's
dominance (trochaic versus iambic), or its size (binary versus unary). Technically, this involves a ranking of a DPS
constraint above a foot form constraint.
A three syllable window emerges when an adjunct is allowed in the weakly layered foot, so that the head may be mis-
aligned with one (but not both) foot edges. As compared to two syllable windows, the number of representationalpossibilities for non-peripheral stress increases. For each non-peripheral stress position, four representational optionsoccur, as shown below.
(66) Three syllable windows: adjunct allowed
a. final window
U ([ ]) # ([  ]) # ( [ ]) # ( [])
P ([ ]) # ([  ])# ( []) # ([ ])
A ([ ])
b. initial windowI # ([ ]) # ([ ]) # ([ ]) # ([ ])
S # ([  ]) # ( []) # ([  ]) # ( [])
T # ( [ ])
Observe that the three-way stress contrast is representationally encoded as variation in four aspects of foot form: head
dominance, head size, head alignment, and foot size. Evidently, foot form variation is not random, but under control of
constraint interaction. Crucially, a weakly layered foot model of stress windows should not be combined with extrametricality
(of the final syllable unparsability type) as this would incorrectly predict four syllable window systems. (See Everett, 1988:233for a similar argument based on Piraha .) However, non-finality can be assumed as an unstressability requirement.
The following constraint set will be assumed:

H
D-BINis the counterpart of F T-BINin the binary model, and it is evaluated analogously. Analogously to assumptions
made earlier for the binary foot model, a monosyllabic head violates H D=IAMB, but not H D=TROCHEE . The Weakly Layered
Model has no constraints requiring peripheral syllables to be non-parsed by a foot, as in the binary foot model; the onlyconstraint referring to the final syllable requires its unstressability: N
ON-FINALITY . To determine the side of the adjunct
with respect to the head, a pair of head-to-foot alignment constraints (67b--c) are assumed. In case both constraints arehigh-ranked, the adjunct is suppressed, in which case the size of the foot equals the size of its head (i.e. maximally twoR.

-no lapse and clash constraints 
-word -to-foot alignment constraints keep main stress foot at an edge while separate 
constraints on foot form locate the stressed syllable within this maximal ly trisyllabic 
foot domain; in the foot-free model all constraints are constraints on stress since 
there is no foot or grouping by hypothesis 
-the mid-point pathology does not arise in Kager s model since no consistent ranking 
of the constraint set will prod uce this syndrome: to get third -syllable stress in a five 
syllable word with lexical accent, the constraints defining the default must dominate 
Faith for lexical stress; but then they w ill also override lexical stress within the 
window; if Faith for lexical accent is top ranked then lexical accent can surface 
independent of the window 
[6] Stanton (2014) 
-over-generat ion in the typology of grammars predicted with lapse constraints does 
not automatically entail weakly layered feet or more generally metrical grouping 
-the evidence nee ded to motivate the ranking with both lapse constraints 
undominated does not appear in the data readily available to the learner 
-thus, such grammars are theoretically possi ble but not reachable for learnability 
reasons (a familiar argument form; cf. Lightfoots 1979 Degree -0 learnability ) 
-to learn the ranking where Exte nded L apse constraints are top -ranked , long words 
(six or seven syllables) are needed and they will be much less frequent in most (non -
agglutinating ) lan guages compared to shorter words 
-for binary -laps e dominant constraints the long -word argument does not hold and the 
claim is that it is difficult to infer the appropriate ranking change (aka the credit 
problem) with the Gradual Learning Algorithm 
-other pathologies: given Kagers 2001 constraints licensing lapses at the s tress peak, 
a possible ranking will shift location of main stress in odd -parity words to license a 
lapse. But this is also not at tested . (not clear if this bears on the grouping question)

tionality by including the left/right target edge in their statement (examples for harmon- 
ies involving consonants include Cole &amp; Kisseberth 1995, Padgett 1995a, Gafos 1996, 
Nif Chiosaiin &amp; Padgett 1997, cf. Walker 1998). Likewise, in rule-based approaches, 
the direction is incorporated into the rule's description (e.g. Poser 1982, Shaw 1991, 
Odden 1994). In the ABC approach, IDENT-CC constraints compel agreement between 
consonants, and it is here that we locate the directionality statement.33 
In Kikongo, the rightward direction of nasal agreement indicates that IDENT- 
CLCR(nas) is prioritized above IDENT-CRCL(nas). Since IDENT-CLCR is always obeyed 
by the consonants that participate in Kikongo nasal agreement, we locate this constraint 
at the top of the hierarchy. The dominated status of IDENT-CRCL will become apparent 
when we examine forms in which an oral voiced stop or approximant consonant pre- 
cedes a nasal in a stem. 
First, we determine the ranking of IDENT-OI(nas) with respect to IDENT-CLCR(nas) 
and the nasal correspondence hierarchy. In Kikongo, any voiced stop becomes nasal 
if preceded by a nasal in the stem. This signals that CORR-N+-B and IDENT-CLCR(nas) 
together outrank IDENT-OI(nas), as shown in 52. The winning candidate in 52a estab- 
lishes correspondence between the nasal and suffix consonant, and they agree for nasal- 
ity.34 In 52b, the stops do not correspond, incurring a fatal violation of CORR-N4-B, 
and in 52c the stops correspond but do not agree in nasality, an outcome ruled out by 
IDENT-CLCR(nas). 
agreement. This is captured by situating IDENT-OI(nas) below CORR-N+-L as well. We 
locate CORR-N+--L and CORR-N4-B together in the nasal correspondence hierarchy, as 
their similarity rankings are very close. The outcome is illustrated in 53. Candidates 
53b and 53c, which do not nasalize /1/ in the output, are eliminated on the basis of 
CORR-N4-4L and IDENT-CC(nas), respectively.35 
3" Compare another kind of approach in which apparent directionality effects seen in certain kinds of 
assimilation are accomplished via positional faithfulness constraints without statement of direction (e.g. 
Padgett 1995c, Beckman 1997, 1998, Lombardi 1999, Walker 2001b). 
34 Whether we posit /1/ or /d/ as the input suffix consonant does not figure here. Either way, it will be 
realized as [d] before [i] if oral, which we attribute to a contextual markedness constraint that we refer to 
descriptively as *[li]. 
35 We regard it as unsurprising that under nasal agreement the affected consonant becomes a plain nasal 
stop at the cost of manner features that might be active in the segment. When, for instance, [1] becomes a 
nasal segment it does not retain its approximant nature (attributable to the feature [lateral]). In addition, there 
are no reports of nasal continuants in languages where continuant approximants are affected by nasal agree- 
ment in MSCs. The explanation here is twofold. First, the dispreference for nasalized continuants/approxi- 
mants is well documented (Padgett 1995b). Constraints on such configurations will trigger the hardening of 
approximants to stops under nasalization. Second, the formation of nasal stops rather than nasalized segments 
better satisfies IDENT-CC requirements. These constraints will promote the closest match in stricture and 
other properties between agreeing segments.

stop participate agreement. 
follows from its lack of similarity to the nasal: the nasal and oiceless stop are not 
sufficiently similar to provoke correspondence in Kikongo, and hence agreement is not 
enforced between them. Candidates in which these consonants are in correspondence 
are 
screened out by faithfulness constraints: [nxirlxunxu] incurs a gratuitous violation 
of IDENT-OI(nas), and likewise [nxikxunxu] with respect to IDENT-CC(nas). Correspon- 
dence between consonants in the output thus occurs only when compelled by similarity- 
driven constraints, and the neutrality of voiceless consonants (and vowels and voiced 
fricatives) follows straightforwardly. 
The tableau in 54 addresses directionality. Nasal agreement in this word produces 
nasalization in the 1/ to the right of the nasal but leaves the oral quality of the /d/ to 
its left intact. The resulting output sequence obeys IDENT-CLCR(nas), which requires 
that corresponding consonants following a nasal be specified [nasal], but it violates 
IDENT-CRCL(nas), which requires a [nasal] specification in corresponding consonants 
preceding a nasal. It is the interleaving of IDENT-OI(nas) between these constraints that 
achieves unidirectional agreement. The ranking of IDENT-CLCR(nas) over IDENT-OI(nas) 
compels rightward nasal agreement in the /1/, as evident in comparison of 54a and 54e. 
The one-way directionality is seen in 54a versus 54b,c. In 54a, as opposed to 54b, both 
candidates establish correspondence between all three voiced consonants and both obey 
IDENT-CLCR(nas). But the leftward agreement affecting the first voiced consonant in 
54b incurs a fatal violation of IDENT-OI(nas). Even though this candidate fares better 
with respect to IDENT-CRCL(nas), this constraint is dominated by IDENT-OI(nas), and 
hence a faithful mapping of the leftward /d/ is favored. Candidates 54a and 54c incur 
equal violations with respect to IDENT-OI(nas), but 54c violates CORR-N+-L while 54a 
obeys it. Nasalization of the first voiced consonant is 
thus again suboptimal. CORR- 
C+--C constraints also rule out candidates 54d and 54f. 
The final point that we address in our analysis of Kikongo nasal 
neutrality of NC clusters. We attribute the neutrality of nasals in NC 
dissimilarity from the potentially affected oral consonants. 
We consider two 
for distinguishing the behavior of singleton nasals from nasals in NCs: 
reference to their different syllable positions, and the other involves reference to their 
different release status. We develop the former approach here, but also sketch the latter 
possibility, leaving the choice between them to further researc 
Turning to the syllable 
position approach, we speculate that nasals in medial NCs 
belong in a syllable coda. In contrast, singleton nasals belong to an onset, as do singleton 
oral stops. If syllable position is a factor contributing to segments' relative similarity, 
then the coda nasals' difference in this regard from the onset stops could give rise to 
their neutrality. In the area of language performance, studies have found that segments 
occupying the same syllable position are more likely to participate in speech errors 
(Shattuck-Hufnagel 1983, 1987). This lends support to the notion that matching syllable 
roles contribute to segments' similarity. In support of the heterosyllabic status of medial

Kikongo, (1991:195, n. 2) points out a 
C word-initially (e.g. nkosi 'lion'), but not word-medially in normal rate speech (e.g. zinkosi 'lions'). He attributes this difference to the different syllabic roles of the nasals. 
Word-initial NCs are analyzed as tautosyllabic sequences. Note that with respect to 
neutrality, our attention 
is limited to medial NCs only, because in initial NCs the nasal 
derives from a prefix, which stands outside the stem domain in which nasal 
operates. 
The preference for relations to exist between segments with matching roles 
structure is accomplished 
by the constraint in 55 (after Gafos 1996, 
McCarthy &amp; Prince 1993, 1994, Suzuki 1999). 
(55) SROLE-CC: Corresponding consonants must have identical syllable roles. 
The scenario is laid out in 56. SROLE-CC dominates CORR-C --C constraints so as 
to inhibit correspondence between similar consonants 
that have different syllable roles. 
This ranking is responsible for eliminating candidates 56b and 56c, where the nasal in 
the NC cluster is in correspondence with a singleton onset consonant. Candidate 56c 
also fails to show nasal agreement between corresponding consonants, violating IDENT- 
CLCR(nas). Candidate 56a is optimal: it obeys SROLE at the cost of CORR-N+--L. (It is 
assumed here that the input contains a high vowel in the suffix, which is lowered 
through the operation of vowel harmony.)

rsal inventory of positions that are of particular phonetic prominence or
s noted earlier (section 3.1), I assume that harmony does not obtain
r range of vowel contrasts found there (due to many disharmonic
leged position I have in mind is the morphological root, and the
relevant positional Ident  constraint is given below. The reader is referred to Beckman and
references therein for extensive motivation of the root as a cross-linguistically priveleged position.
(20) I DENT RT(F): Let SI and SObe corresponding segments of the input and output,
where SO is in the Root. Then if SI is specified [ F], SO is specified
[F], where is +,-, or 0.
Putting together the rankings justified so far, we have *[+rnd, -hi] &gt;&gt; Spread(Color) &gt;&gt;
Ident. Since the vowels [o,] are preserved in roots by IdentRt, this constraint must be highestdifferently:
both vowels originate in the root vowel, but they spread differently. Turkish also
the opposite arrangement: [back] and [round] differing not in what they
nate. They involve disharmonic stems ending in palatalized [ly], as in
s and Sezer 1982). There is a contrast in Turkish stem-finally between
the plain and palatalized lateral; compare (27)b. The palatalized lateral not only bears the feature
[-back], but triggers [back] harmony; this is why the accusative suffix is [-back] in the forms of(27)a. What is interesting is that the suffix is targeted as expected by the [+round] specification ofthe root-final vowel in (27)a, even though it is obviously not affected by the [+back] sprecificationof that vowel. Compare these forms to those in (27)b, which behave as expected according to myearlier analysis.With this basic understanding of harmony in hand, we can return to the problem of partial
class behavior. Important to the account is a well-known markedness generalization noted already(Trubetzkoy 1939): color feature contrasts are most favored in high vowels, less so in midvowels, and least of all in low vowels. Further, environments of vowel reduction tend to displayless marked inventories. Haiman (1972) and Hulst and Weijer (1991) note that the reduced vowelinventory derived by Turkish vowel harmony, shown in (17), should be viewed as less marked inthis sense.
(17) Vowels produced by Turkish harmony
i     u
  e   a
In practice, this reduction has sometimes been enforced through a stipulation on roundness
harmony itself (e.g., Lees 1961, Clements and Sezer 1982). Yet there is an independent need inthe theory for an account of the relative markedness of non-high round vowels, as evidenced bypatterns in languages involving both underlying and reduction inventories, and it is thereforegreatly preferable to attribute this property of roundness harmony to the interaction of anindependent constraint, factoring the height stipulation out of the harmony generalizationaltogether, as advocated by Haiman (1972). Putting aside further questions concerning the bestaccount of the cross-linguistic height-color interaction, for convenience I w ill refer to a constraint
*[+round, -high] (Kirchner 1993, Kaun 1995, abbreviated *[+rnd, -hi]).
Applied to the analysis at hand, the idea is that the ranking between the two constraints
*[+rnd, -hi] &gt;&gt; Spread(Color) is the source of partial class spreading in Turkish. Consider thenext constraint tableau, whose candidates are parallel in structure to those of (16), except that thecandidate with no suffix vowel features is omitted. Candidate (18)a, with perfect harmony, is nolonger optimal, because by spreading [+round] to a non-high vowel it violates *[+rnd, -hi] twice.Candidates (18)b-c spread only one feature, and (18)d none at all. Because (18)c spreads[+round], it again violates *[+rnd, -hi] twice. Of (18)b and d, both violate Spread, but (18)bviolates it less and is therefore the output.

6. Hiatus is avoided; onsetless syllables are only found word- initially. T he onset requirement can lead to 
a violation of Harmonic Nucleus in whi ch a less optimal , lower sonority nucleus is chosen in order to 
avoid two successive syllabic nuclei.

	 Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui surmount this problem by building the onset into the first step of their 
algorithm, which parses a core CV syllable: associate a core CV syllable with any sequence 
(Y)Z, where Z is /a/; where Z is a high vowel, wher e Z is a liquid, where Z is a nasal,

	 some remedies considered include stating the constraint in positive terms going from best to

ill.mas he spun (wool) for him *i.ll.mas ay.yis horse *a.yi.ys a.faw.wu *a.fa.wuw 
 thus, a true (tautomorphemic) geminate can form coda- onset (ay.yi s), nucleus coda (xlls pay 
perf), and complex coda (ill.mas ), but not onset- nucleus distributing the consonant across the 
bisegmental sequence with the largest acoustic disparity 
	 if the first half of a geminate is more sonorous than the second, then onset -coda pars e would be 
a mismatch in prominence (see Mo rita 201 4 for further examples)

            analysis: 
-Stress -to Weight: initial stressed syllable has complex rime: long vowel or coda 
consonant 
- a markedness constraint against long vowels is interleaved with the sonority 
scale banning a certain sonority distance between the coda and following onset 
-sonority scale: glide &gt; r &gt; l &gt; nasal &gt; voiced fric &gt; voi ced stop &gt; voiceless 
fric &gt; voiceless stop 
-*Coda- Onset Rise evaluated from wor st to best: *Coda -Onset Rise = 6 &gt; *Coda -
Onset Rise = 5 &gt; *Coda -Onset Rise = 4, etc. 
-so most clusters do not violate the contact threshold and hence will yield a 
closed stressed syllable 
-but when the coda- onset sonority difference is 5 or greater then th e markedness 
constraint against lon g vowels is violated

Case Study 2 Imdlawn Tashilhiyt Berber (D ell &amp; Elmedlaoui 1985 et seq., 20 03) 
ITB allows any consonant to be a syllabic nucleus but still optimizes the nucleus with higher sonority 
if possible. Since there are long strings of consonants in the input, there are many possible parses 
that would be valid syllabifications in isolation. But speakers converge on a unique parse. Syllable 
parses are based on speaker judgments, versification, and grammatical rules. 
Presents a problem of global comparison and was used by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993 , 2004 ) to 
motivate Optimality Theory : a small difference at one point in the stri ng can have remote 
consequences --difficult to formalize with local rules th at build up structure in ignorance of the final

adapted with anaptyxis (epenthesis) unless they are sC, where pros thesis is preferred

[1]. In various languages the inherent weight of a syllable contributes to its prominence. Often there is more
than a bin
ary (heavy vs. light) distinction. In case of culminativity, there can be complex interactions with
edgemost: ties resolved by edge orientation. Will it be consistent through all levels of weight? Nonfinalitymay also play a role as well as certain window restrictions.

[7] "Quality"- sensitive stress (Kenstowicz 1994, 1997) 
We have seen that stress is sensitive to the weight of syllables, distinguishing two, three, and 
someti m
es even more (Piraha) degrees of stressability. Here we look at various cases where 
stressability depends on the vowel phonemes comprising the syllable. 
[8]. some minor precedents 
	 avoid stressing schwa: recall the Rhythm Rule and Sabine Iat ridou [02#100] vs. 
Christine Graham [23#1] 
	 in Polish main stress is penultimate; there are some 14 lexical items with 
antepenu l
timate stress: uniwrsytet, repblik, repblik -a; most have penult [i] 
	 [Vst] penults in English (Davis 1992); an Island of Reliability (Albright 2002)

response by the native speaker or the analyst to the question What syllable is strongest in this word?

Universit Toulouse Le Mirail, 7-13-01
Michael Kenstowicz, MIT and ILPGA 
Fon. Fon (Gbto 2000) is one of the principal varieties of Gbe (Ewe) spoken in Bnin. It
is an open syllable language with three tonal levels and rising and falling tones. The data
below are taken from Gbtos study of loanword adaptation (primarily from French).
The author raises but does not address the question of the extent to which the truncationsfound here are the product of French grammar vs. Fon. Evidently, the process is notoperative in Fon. In any case, the segmental adaptations fully conform to the patterns
found in Fon loanword phonology. 
1. Type A Disyllabic shape at left edge
Low-High tonal pattern presumably mimicking French final stress

2.	 Epenthetic vowels included in count; the epenthetic vowel is [u] in the context ofa labial and otherwise [i].

nu kili  si, kisi

lufi ni dli 
Sylvestre sivsi sili  lu
3.	 Vowel-initial stems have a rising tone instead of high after a voiced consonant.
The replacement of high by rising after a voiced consonant only occurs in theinitial syllable of the stem in Fon. Evidently, Fon speakers treat the initial vowel
in these data as a prefix.

pattern; used as a vocative (cf. English, French).

In this pattern the truncate has a reduplicated structure, say Base#Reduplicant. But the
Bimoraic minimal word is still imposed on the entire structure restricting the size
of the reduplicants base. There are thus two correspondence relations at play:
Base-Truncate and within the truncate a Base-Reduplicant correspondence.

zi ta zi 
/zita/ Anchor-Left BT 
&gt;&gt; Anchor-RT BT 
zi * zi

5.	 Vowel-initial syllable is skipped. The reduplicated structure would produce ahiatus: Habib -&gt; [a.a]. 
Evidently this marked structure is avoided by misaligning
the left edge.

6.	 Initial rhotic syllable is skipped. Initial rhotics are adapted as a cluster / l /. e.g. 
rideau 
-&gt; [ li  do ]. But the / l / cluster is not found word medially and so
evidently the reduplication structure of the template could not be satisfied and
hence a noninitial syllable is chosen instead.

 [9] An a  lternative t  o X -slots as a m  odel  of  timing i  s traditional  notion  of  mora (H  yman  1985,  
 Hayes  1989)  
	  heavy  syllable  contains  two  moras  and  light  syllable  one  
         	               
   |   |  \    | \     |\   |\      / |  
                         |

      t  a      t   a     t   a    n    p  a  n  e      p a  n    a  = [panna]  
	  For  Hayes  a geminate consonant  is a ssociat ed  to  the  second  mora o  f  the  first syllable  
and  to  the  onset of the  following  syllable;  for H yman  the  onset and  nuclear v  owel  
associate to  the same mora  
	  Latin  Stress:  Pe.ne.lo.pe,  Ra.mo:.na,  A.man.da  
	  the  penultimate  syllable  is  monomoraic  in  the  first  but  bimoraic  in the  latter  two  
[10] 	   Compensatory  Lengthening  (Hayes  1989)  
 Loss  of  a segment  is  compensated  by lengthening adjacent  segment  
	  Most  common  is  loss  of  coda  consonant  leading  to  long  vowel

          <text>24.961 Serial Derivations in OT 
In Clas
sical OT the input is mapped to the output in one step with no intermediate stages
(fully pa ra
llel)
This factor allows constra i nts to perform global comparisons referring to information
that only be comes available later in the derivation in the traditional ordered rule
framework: top down effects, remote structures
but there are situations where valid generalizations require reference to intermediate
stage s betwee
n the input and the output
two altern ative appro ac hes are explored in the current generative literature to capture
this phenomenon : Stratal Optimality Theo ry (Kiparsky, Rubach, Anttila, Bermudez -
Otero, Jones, ) and Harmonic Serialism (McCarthy , Pater , Elfner, Pruitt,  )
Harmonic Serialism 
input mapped to output via a Gen -Eval loo p; Gen is restricted to minimal modifications
of the input: add or delete a single segment, change a single feature coefficient. Whatcounts as a minimal change is a research question (e.g. reparsing of syllable str ucture
comes for free)
the candidates are submitted to the rank e
 d constraint set and an optimal candidate
emer ges through normal evaluation , which is then sent back to Gen for another round of
candidate creation by minimal changes
when the Gen -Eval loop leads to no change , the derivation is said to converge  on the
output
derivations thus display monotoni c improvement , given the M &gt; F constraint ranking
Example 1 Macushi C arib (McCarthy 2010) 
stress is parsed by left- to-right iam b s and then the weak vowel of the foot is deleted
/wanamari/ -&gt; wnmr mirr or 
/u-wanamari -ri/ -&gt; wnmrr i my mi r ror 
insertion 
and deletion of a foot is assumed to be an elementary operation
constraints and ranking:
Parse-syllables: p en alize a syllable that is not par sed by a foot 
*Weak vowel in foot : penalize an unstressed vowel in the foot
Max-V 
ranking: Parse- syll  *Weak -Vowel  Max- V

So Parse- Syll  *V-Place /weak enforces multiple footing of the word before deletion can occur ; 
then the weak vowel of (mar ) deletes to give (wn )(mr ). When this output is submitted again to 
Gen-Eval, all syllables are parsed, no weak vowels appear, and no further deletion will occur so 
Eval converge s on same output as in the previous loop and thus (wn)(mr) is the fina l output. 
An alternative derivation that deletes the weak vowel of the second foot and then the first also 
converges on (wn)(mr). 
Classical OT has no intermediate stage and thus has no easy way to distinguish the intended 
winner from losing competitor s based solely on the output forms plus Max -V: it is only by going 
through the intermediat e step of creating an iambic (s s) that the deleting weak vowels are 
defined

abat katbt  st ress  
---------- katbit epenthesis  
2. OT constraints: 
*Complex onset,coda : pena li ze syllables with a complex onset or coda 
PwHd: penalize a Prosodic word that does not parse a foot (and therefor e have stress) 
Foot-Bin: penalize a foot that is not bimoraic (one heavy or two lights) 
Non-Fin: penalize a foot that parses a word -final syllable 
Parse segments into syllables : penalize a segment not in a syllable 
Align -Rt: penalize feet that are not aligned with right edge of word 
3. ranking: PwHd, N o n-Fin, Ft-Bin  Align -Rt 
/katab -at/ PwHd Ft-Bin Non-Fin Align -Rt

ka(tb)&lt;t&gt; *! 
5. On the next Gen -Eval loop, ka(t)bit is still mapped to ka(t)bit and so this is the output. 
6. The serialization of Stress before Epenthesis depends crucia l ly on allowing candidates with 
just one change per loop (either epenthesis or foot parsing but not both) and relying on 
constraint ranking to choose foot parsing over epenthesis as the optimal output; on the second 
loop the requirement to have a stress is satisfied and so the candidate with epenthesis plus the 
earlier introduced stress can emerge as the winner. 
7. Classical OT cannot (easily) choose (kata)bat over ka(ta)bat while also choosing ka(ta ) bit over 
(kata)bit without referring to the derivational status of the vowels as underlying (templatic) vs. 
inserted .

          <text>Stratal OT appears to be able to describe more cases of opacity than Harmonic Serialism if one is 
allowed to freely assign different alternations to different strata, sometimes without independent 
evidence from the morphology. At least for the Arabic case there is some independent evidence 
for the phrasal (p ostlexical) status of the epenthesis since if the next word begins with a vowel 
then there is no epenthesis: kat bt il-ktub I wrote the books vs. rib il -hwa he drank the 
coffee

Bloomfield (1933) observed that diminutive suffix chen does not shift to a back consonant after 
a back vocoid ( Kuh, Kuhchen [ku: n]) and suggested that there was a # juncture in this 
structure /ku:# n/, supporting the idea that the Ident -[back]  *[+back, -cons]  ranking 
characterizes the outer layer of word structure

Kinande cast with the Stratal OT model.

The Serial OT model will not be able to treat all cases of derivational opacity the same way; 
future research will determine which provides an overall better typology of the data 
Stratal OT 
In this model the input is map ped to t he output through a series of sub -grammars of classical -
format parallel OT constraint rankings. The subgrammars reflect successively more inclusive 
morphological and phrasal domains: e.g. stem &gt; word &gt; phrase. The constraint rankings may 
differ (minimally) from one stratum to another.

8.  While  rise  and fall  can be  unrestricted in distribution,  convex and concave  tones  with two inflection 
points  are  typically derived:  recall  Mandarin T3 plus  toneless  syllable:  suggests  fall+high.  Suzhou (Yip

9.  gross  typology  
 
	  tone sandhi often dissmilatory; changes  first  of two s  imilar/identical  tones  
	  tone deletion: noninitial (Shanghai) left -edge stress;  nonfinal  (Xiamen)  right -edge stress  
	  tone shift: preserve initial tone but realize on right edge (Zhenhai); preserve final tone but realize  
on initial  (Wenzhou)

3. Results
 3 . 1. Tones produced in isolation
To establish the canonical forms of the four Mandarin tones produced by the
speakers in this study  ,tones produced in isolation were analyzed rst  .Fig .2 shows
the average f 0contour of the syllable  / ma /in the four tones  ,obtained by
averaging over all tokens produced by all eight speakers (48 utterances for eachtone) and plotted as functions of average relative time of each segment
 ,with the
average duration of Tone 3 as the reference duration (100%)  .The cross symbol  
indicates boundaries between  /m /and  /a / .Tone 1 starts with a high f 0value
(near 130 Hz) and stays around that level throughout the syllable  .Tone 2 starts with
a low f 0(near 110 Hz)  ,then falls slightly before rising (starting at 20% into the
vowel) throughout the remainder of the syllable  .Tone 3 starts with an f 0value
slightly lower than the onset of Tone 2  ,falls to the lowest f 0of all the four tones
(about 90 Hz) right at the vowel midpoint  ,then rises sharply to the end of the
syllable  .Tone 4 starts with the highest f 0value of the four tones (140 Hz)  ,continues
to rise before reaching the maximum about one fth of the way into the vowel  ,then
falls sharply to the end of the syllable  .
In terms of duration  ,Tone 4 is the shortest tone (214 ms on average)  ,Tone 3 is
the longest (349 ms)  ,while Tones 1 and 2 have intermediate durations  ,with Tone 2
(273 ms) longer than Tone 1 (247 ms)  .These duration patterns match those found in
previous studies (e  . g.,Lin ,1988)  .
The f 0patterns of tones produced in isolation reect relatively directly the
canonical forms of the tones  .In multisyllabic utterances  ,the canonical forms will be
distorted by various factors  ,including the adjacent onset and offset values of the
neighboring tones  .As suggested earlier and demonstrated by Xu (1994  a ), it is

Various phonological rules/constrai nts categorize syllables in te rms of their size as heavy vs. 
light

	 Minimality: *re, res, re:, *tra, *stra 
	 Tonal contour: Lithuanian: 
matti [] to see krtis [r ] pole ntis [] duck bt [] bee 
mats [] will see kar  [] bitterness atis [] breast ms [] fly tis 
- rise vs. fall realized on two sonorous rhymal units; a single one does not support a 
tonal contour 
[2] parameter of variation in coda consonants 
 Sonorous rime duration for stress: CVV(C) &gt; CVR &gt; CVO &gt;CV (R=sonorant, O=Obs) 
Arabic: CVV, CVR, CVO vs. CV
 
Kwakwala: CVV, CVR vs. CVO
 
Mongolian: CVV vs. CVR, CVO
 
[3] traditional moraic vs. X-slot model of length 
X-slot model 
	 In the default case, each segment is associat ed with a single timing slot counting each 
phoneme as equivalent for size constraints 
	 Geminate vowels and consonan ts associated with two slots 
	 For affricates and prenasalized stops, two orde red features associate with a single slot 
	 Heavy syllables defined  as branching in syllable nucle us or rime (parameterized) 
Moraic model (Hayes 1989) 
	 Heavy syllable has two moras an d light syllable has one mora 
	 Long vowel associated to two moras and short vowel to one 
	 Geminate consonant associated  with a mora in the input 
	 Parametrized rule associates coda consona nt with a mora (Arabic yes, Mongolian no)

          <text>VC.CV vs. VC# 
- other things being equal, these are equi valent domains in terms of syllable parsing 
but VCC is a longer interval and hence we can make sense of languages where VC# 
counts as light, such as Arabic where VCC. V and VCC# pattern together: ktabat, 
katbna, katbt 
-	also predicts V:C &gt; V:# (any examples?) 
	 allows for a greater than binary gradation among syllables and pr edicts that onset 
consonants that are inherently longer or sh orter could distinguish among VCCV clusters 
- recall Icelandic V:.CCV vs. VC.CV wher e former parse is found with voiceless 
stop/s + r,j,v: 
- to draw this distinc tion in string-based te rms possibly the glides are counted as 
part of the following vowel or their dura tion is more difficult to assess? 
[11] implies that a consonant wi ll contribute to weight regardles s of its location in the interval, 
while the syllabic parse distinguis hes onset vs. coda positions 
-	 stop-liquid rising sonority clusters parse as onsets in Italian: natra vs. anrco2 
and [r] is short; but if this is a real contrast then why is prevocalic [r] less 
weighty than preconantal? (its not ; the obstruent onsets differ according 
to McCrary, motivated by the singleton-geminate contrast) 
- similar divergence noted by Lowenst amm &amp; Kaye (1982): stop-liquid (onset) 
clusters block devocalization in French 
loue [lu] louer [lwe] vs. troue [tru] trouer [truwe] 
tue [ty] tuer [te] vs. influe [fly] influer [flye] 
lie [li] li [lje] vs. plie [pli] pli [plije] 
- this contrast can apparently be extended to medial position: arguer [arge] vs. 
affrioler [afrijole] tempt 
- so why is there a difference between a pr evocalic and a preconsonantal liquid in 
terms of weight/maximal cluster size? tr aditional onset.coda parse expresses this as 
restriction on onset size to a maximum of two positions and hence ar.ge vs. 
a.fri.jole *a.frjo.le, while intervals seem to lose this distinction or require a 
different characterization of the contributi on of liquids to the cl uster restriction 
that might recapitulate onset-coda distinction? 
- if a difference is found, is this a contri bution of the phonology to the phonetics or 
vice versa or do they work in tandem?

&gt; VC are well established (Dinka), we are not aware of the former (except for 
geminates)  
- in a series of phoneme monitoring exp   eriments in the 1980s, Jacques Mehler and 
colleagues find that in monitoring for [ba] French subjects are faster for balance 
[bals] than balcon [balk] while monitoring for [bal] they are faster for balcon 
[balk] than balance [bals]. They conclude that th e syllable is a perceptual 
template for speech processing. Pallier et al. (1993) extend this paradigm to 
clusters; not clear how string based model would capture this difference

Under clas sic moraic theory, the geminate vs. singleton contrast implies a mora

main stress is preserved as a secondary stress via cyclic (output-output) faithfulness; this

[12] summary remarks 
The constraints in Gordons system are phonetically/psycho-linguistically grounded: 
marking word edges may aid in parsing and *clash and *lapse enforce rhythmic distribution of prominence 
It is more parsimonious in that it eschews grouping; cf. Kagers constraint set, which 
includes constraints against clashes and lapses as well as footing constraints 
different intuition from foot parsing, which sees prosody as a chunking operation 
analogous alternative conceptions of syllabification as waves of sonority vs. constituents 
with internal headed structure

or plurals of these words ( Rosa2s, sofa2s)( s e et a b l e5 ) .F i g u r e6s h o w st h a tF 1o fw o r d -  n a l
schwa varies across a wide range, extending to the vicinity of low vowels, although the meanof 659 Hz indicates a mid vowel.
4 Discussion
This study of reduced vowels reveals a fundamental distinction between word-nal schwa andother reduced vowels: word-nal schwas center around a mid vowel quality, while reducedvowels in other positions are generally high. This suggests that the minimal contrast in pairslike roses Rosa s arises because the word-nal vowel quality of Rosa is partially preserved
on the addition of an inectional sufx such as the possessive /-z/, while the reduced vowelinroses is the usual high, centralized vowel quality found in non-nal unstressed vowels.
The difference between nal and non-nal reduced vowels can be related to differences
between the unstressed vowel systems in these positions. While non-nal schwa is not incontrast with other unstressed vowel qualities, there are four contrasting unstressed vowelqualities in word-nal position: / i,,oU/, and the rhotic vowel /

	 Since the process applies across labials (cf. krp -a-ma:a), the Place features are not binary but 
unary and on a separate autosegmental tier 
	 even though the target is [+nasal] and the trigger [+contin] , intervening cor onal stops block 
the rule , as in mrd -na: 
	 this follows if the contrast between /d/ and / / is recorded in the lexical representation as a 
binary [anterior ] rather than [0anterior] vs. [ anterior] 
	 but the behavior of /r/ is problematic; since there is no contras t between a retr oflex and 
nonretroflex rhotic , the [anterior, distributed] features would be predictable and hence 
might not be expected to be present at the point the rule applies 
	 one possible mitigating factor is that the single rhotic has the marked v alues for [anter ior] and 
[distributed] and so they would be assigned by a rule that is not a default rule assigning the 
unmarked values of [+anterior, distrib] 
	 another perspective: suppose the retroflex gesture is held after the retroflex conson ant up unt il 
the next coronal consonant (not heard on vowel); it is blocked on a /t,s,n/ by faithfulness 
	 we will revisit this question when we look at vowel harmony in a couple of weeks

	  While  some feature contrasts  such  as  [high]  and  [back]  readily  show  harmony  for  both 
values ,  for o ther fe atures j  ust one  value  is p honologically  active  and  the  other is   largely  inert:  
secondary a  rticulations like l  abialization,  palatalization,  nasality,  voicing.  
	  Some researchers  hypothesize  that this  distinction is  drawn  in  the  representation: in  stead  of 
[round] we h  ave j ust  [round] and  the a bsence o  f  [round] is interprete d phonetically  as  no lip  
protrusion the  default state   
	  More  controversial  is  extension of  this  proposal  to  [voice],  [nasal]   
	  intervention  effects a  nd  autosegments  are  used as  a  probe  for  such  inert  features:  e.g.  rendaku 
and  voice in  Japanese  where  rendaku  arises  from  a floating [voice]  and  Lymans  Law  defined  
over  [voice]  not  voiceless  and voiceless  is  transparent  
	  but  reference  to [ voice]  is  needed  for  the vowel  length  distinction  in  English  writer -rider  (cf.  
Bermudez -Otero  2014)  and in many  languages  with right -to-left nasal harmony underlying  
/ama/ is  realized  as  [mba]  where  it  appears  that  the  [nasal]  of  the  second vowel  is  spread to 
the  preceding  nasal  consonant to  give  a  prenasalized  stop  
	  can  such  cases  be  circumscribed  under  the  heading  of  phonet ic  enhancements  and  not part of 
the  phonology  proper ?  
	  Elan Dresher  and  Keren  Rice  at  U  Toronto  have  pursued  these q  uestions of  contrast  and   
underspecification  in  a  number o  f publications

	  since t  his is the o  nly so urce o f  vowel  nasality i  n  English ,  a nasal  vowel  implicates  a following

	  results:  congruent  stimuli  are  faster th  an  incongruent ones  and  incongruent [ bt] is  faster than

	  the  vowel  provides  information  for  the  identity  of the  following  consonant  and  the  nasal  vowel

Spanish 
In Spanish stress is located in a three -sylla ble window at the right edge of the word (a remnant of the Latin
Stress rule). The foot is commonly regarded as trochaic SW. Two types of truncation are reported that 
parallel those discused last time from Italian 1. Right -edge truncation ( Cont
 inental Spanish, Prieto 1992)

    Following Prietos  observation lets  say that  word final  [r,l,n,s]  can share  the  mora of  the  
 preceding  vowel  while  other  consonants  cannot  and so [Dvid]  violates  foot form .

          <text>Prosodic Morphology-2: Japanese hypocoristics, truncations, and argots 
Japanese syllables: CV, CVV, CVN, CVG; Japanese is traditionally described as a
mora language; it has a pitch-accent system with a drop in pitch (f
ormalized as a [H*L] 
pitch accent by Beckman &amp; Pierrehumbert 1988) after the accented mora. Intensive study of the language over the past 15 years has shown that the metrical foot plays a fundamental role in various aspects of the prosody.  
Hypocoristics: Poser 1990, Mester 1992 [1]. Pattern-1 personal names: a variety of possible patterns obtain (see Sugawara 2012 
for recent analysis of their accent); the one constant is truncation to a bimoraic foot show
ing the top-ranking of Ft-Bin.  Words without an accent mark belong to the 
unaccented class and are associated with a LHH pitch contour.

[5] generalizations 
- There is left-edge anchoring; a heavy syllable is largely confined to the left 
edge; the systematic breakup of the LH sequences to LL suggests that a bimoraic trochee (F= [LL], [
H]) is at play, similar to the hypocoristics. But 
surprisingly, a single H is avoided and larger structures occur: FF and F+L. 
- Accent follows the Latin Stress Rule except that in four-mora words a 
preference for unaccented structures obtains 
- It &amp; Mester 1992 suggest that strict layering of the prosodic hierarchy is a 
violable constraint; and that this w
ord formation process imposes a 
requirement of
 binary branching at the level of the PW or Foot: P-derived 
words must be prosodically binary and syllable-internal structure is opaque for word-level conditions (a type of relativized minimality) 
- Feet are aligned to the left. This blocks a Light+H eavy analysis for demoN 
analysis: 	 [L L] branching at Ft level

[LH] invalid f
oot
 
L[H] violates alignment
 [H]L branching at P level
[H] violates syllable as opaque domain for branching

[6] Labrune (2001) constructs a corpus of 277 clippings confirming the findings of It 
90; if compounds like fami(rii) koN(pyuutaa)
family computer are put in a different 
category, then the pool of statistically significant shapes is circumscribed by It &amp;
Mesters Binary Branching requirement plus a ban on final heavy syllables *H# (or perhaps licensing of H only initially). Branching at any level possible; *H# blocks heavy syllables not at the left edge

Observations  
	  In  French  vowels c  ontrast for  nasality  after  oral  and nasal  consonants  
	  In  Gbe  vowels  contrast  for  nasality after  oral  consonants  but  after  nasal  consonants  only 
nasal  vowels  are  found (nasal  harmony)  
	  In  Malay  vowels d  o  not contrast for n asality  after  oral  consonants  but  after  nasal  
consonant s only n  asal  vowels  are  found (nasal  harmony)  
	  In  English  CV  syllables n  asal  vowels a  re  excluded  entirely  
 
Generalizations  
	  All  languages  allow  [ta]; for Stampe this reflects the context -free  denasalization  process;  
for J akobson  the  Law  of Solidarity  that nasal  vowels  imply  oral  vowels b  ut not the  
inverse;  for O T  it reflects th  e  Markedness c  onstraint *[+syll,  +nasal]  (and  the  absence  
of  any context -free  M  ban  on  oral  vowels )  
Analysis  
	  Nasal  harmony  arises  from  a  contextual  markedness  constraint  banning  an  oral  vowel  
after  a nasal  consonant :  *NV   *[+cons,  +nasal]  [+syll,  nasal]  
	  In  order to   have  nasal  vowels in   the  context after a   non-nasal  consonant  (where  there  is 
no M  constraint  demanding  nasality),  nasality  must  be  protected from   *[+syll,  +nasal]  
by  a  faithfulness  constraint :  Ident -[nasal]   *[+syll,  +nasal]

[1] Allophonic  distribution  in  OT  
	  Two  surface  variants  of  an  underlying phoneme [a]  and  [b];  typically one variant  [a] is  
restricted  to a p  articular context  while t  he o ther [b] is th e  elsewhere  case  or  at  least  
occurs  in a  different  range  of  contexts  
	  For  example,  in  Canadian  English the  diphthongs  [j] and [  w]  with  raised  nuclei  are  
restricted  to  appear  before  a  voiceless  consonant : tight  [j]  vs.  tide,  time,  tie,  etc.  [aj]  
	  We  require  a  markedness  constraint  that  bars  the  elsewhere  allophone  [b] in  a  certain  
context  ranked  above  a  more  general  markedn ess  constraint  that  bans  the  conditioned  
allophone [a] : *b in some context    *a  
	   *[+syll,  +low] [ -cons,  +high]  [-voice]  (*ajt)

          <text>there  is a   cross -linguistic hierarchy on which of the three oral places  (labial,  coronal,  dorsal) are 
subject  to  assimilation.  
 
1.  Use  the  information  in  the  following  table  from  Jun  (2004) to  state  the  hierarchy.   
 
Diola  Fogny:  {p,t,k}C place  -&gt;  CplaceC place   (kp  &gt;  pp, 
 
Korean:   {p,t} C place  -&gt;  CplaceC place   (pk  &gt;  kk,  but  kp  &gt;  kp
  
Catalan:  {t} Cplace  -&gt;   CplaceC place   (tk  &gt;  kk,  but  pt  &gt;  pt,
   
Arabic:   no place  assimilation
  
 
2.  Express  the  typology  in OT .  Lets  limit  the discussion  to  intervocalic  clusters,  i.e.  VC1C2V.  You  
may  assume  a markedness  constraint  that  penalizes  a heterorganic  consonant  cluster  (i.e.  a 
cluster  of  two co nsonants  with  distinct  major  articulators)  as  well  as  a faithfulness  constraint  
protecting  the  place  feature  of  the  final,  prevocalic  member  of  the  cluster . The result will be a  
cluster  with  one  major  place  articulator.  We  will  see  the  motivation  for  this  constraint  later  in  
the  semester.  Try  to  express  the  hierarchy  with a  UG fixed  ranking  of Faithfulness  constraints .

Practice  
In  many  languages a   [-contin]  consonant  (stop  or  nasal)  assimilate s  the  major p  lace  of 
articulation  of  a following consonant:  e.g.  English  in-ert  but  i[m]-potent . According  to  Jun  (2004)

        <slide>
          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>There  are  thus  three  constraints  at  play:  context -free  markedness  banning  nasal  vowels  
everywhere , context- sensitive m  arkedness  barring  an oral  vowel  after  a  nasal  consonant, 
and  faithfulness :1  
 
 *V  *[+syll,  +nasal]  
*NV    *[+cons,  +nasal]  [+syll,  +nasal]  
Ident -[nasal] : corresponding input and output segments have the same values  
   for [ nasal]  
 
	  They  can  be  ranked  in  six  ways;  two  pairs  of  rankings  lead  to  equivalent  outputs  
	  French:   Ident -[nasal]  *NV   *V  
  Ident -[nasal ]   *  V  *NV  
Gbe:   *NV    Ident -[nasal]  * V  
Malay:   *NV    *V Ident -[nasal]  
English:   * V  *NV,  Ident -[nasal]  
  *V  Ident -[nasal]  *NV  
	  As  usual  in  languages  with  nasal  harmony  (i.e.  *NV    *V),  other  repairs  must  be  blocked 
such  as denasalizing t  he n asal  consonant  (/ma/  -&gt; [ba])  or  inserting  an  oral  consonant   
[(/ma/  -&gt; [mba])  
 
Remarks  
	  For  Malay (and English)  the  input  could contain nasal  vowels  and they will  be 
 
distributed properly  by  the  *NV  and  *V   markedness  constraints 
 
	  Since in  the OT  model  constraints  are defined  over  the output,  no mechanism  exists  in  
the  grammar to   impose  a  choice  between  oral  and  nasal  vowels in   the  input  
	  This  corollary  is  known  as  Richness  of  the  Base  (RoB)  
	  The  grammar  will  generate  the  correct output regardless o  f which  input occurs  
	  To  the  extent  that  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  single  definitive  input , it must be obtai ned 
from  some  extra -grammatical  source:  e.g.  learning algorithms  (Lexicon  Optimization)  
	  Different  researc hers  have  different  suggestions  on this  matter : choose the input that  is  
the  most optimal  output (Tesar &amp;   Smolensky) ;  thus o ral  for E nglish  and  nasal  after a   
nasal  consonant  in Malay  and oral  otherwise;  others  have  suggested the  opposite:  free-
ride  on nasalization process  and  posit  unmarked  value always  
	  Raises  various  questions  about  the  lexicon  and  lexical access; can one reach the  
lexicon without the intervention of the rules/constraints?   
                                                   
1  Context -sensitive (p  ositional) faithfulness is also p  ossible (e  .g.  nasal  vowels in  some l  anguages 
are restricted  to  stressed  syllables).

stable sh  ort  vowels  in  rigid, rigidity , etc.  the  alternating vowels  must  be 
underlyingly  long;  hence  div/i:/ne,  ser/e:/ne,  prof/:/e;  their q uality  is c hanged  
by  shifting  the  nucleus  of  the  diphthong  (a  change  that is r  ecurrent in  the

          <text>problem f  or  Autonomous  (Structural)  Phonemics:  violates  the  invariance1  condition  and  
yet  schwa  presumed  not  to  be  phonemic   
 
[2] Flapping a  nd v owel  length:  two f amous sound  alternations   (Chomsky  1964)  
	 	  American  Structuralists  concerned  with  contrast;  intuition  that  while  aspirated  [ph] of  
English pool  and  Korean  phul  grass  are phonetically equivalent,  they have distinct  
linguistic  status;  in  Korean  aspiration  is  contras tive  while  in  English  it is n ot   
	 	  contrast  is  to  be  represented  as  a  level  of  the  grammar  (the  phonemic level)  where  only  
contrastive  sounds  (distinctive  features) a  re  represented;  noncontrastive  sounds 
(features )  are allophones  restricted  to t he p honetic  level: English /pul/  -&gt; [phul]  vs.  
Korean  /phul/  -&gt; [phul]   
	 	  procedures  of  analysis  proposed to discover  the  phonemes;  complementary  distribution 
and  minimal  pairs  (see Z ellig  Harris  1951)   
	 	  English flapping:  
a[]om, a[th]omic    be[d] ,  be[]-ing       (cf.  Spanish  where  /d/  and  // contrast )

	 	  conclusion:  flap  [] and m  id-vowel  diphthongs  [j] and [  w] are n ot  phonemes  given  
their l imited  and  predictable  distribution  
 	  writer  [j] vs.  rider  [w] (Bloch  1942)  
minimal  pair:  [j] vs.  [aj];  seems to i  ndicate that  the [aj]  vs.  [j]  difference  is  
     contrastive  (phonemic) despite  its  limited and otherwise predictable distribution  
but  the  difference  is  completely  predictable  if  phonological  processes  apply  sequentially         
to  modify  an  underlying  repre sentation  composed  of  unpredictable i  nformation

	  Templates:  reduplication  is  not  copying  prosodic  constituents of the base but affixation of abs tract 
phonological  categories , which are then filled by copying segments from the base;  
	  Marantz  1982:   reduplication  specifies  an  affix  characterized  in  C-V templatic  terms  plus  a  rule  copying  
phonemes  of  the  base  and mapping  them t  o the  affixal  template  in  a phoneme- driven fashion:

10.  remarks  
	  In  a  survey  of truncation  in  c.  80  languages A  lber fin ds th at truncation  templates ty  pically  anchor  to  the first  
syllable  or the  stressed  syllable  (two  salient  positions in  lexical  access)  
	  Fixed ranking of  Anchor -Left,  Anchor -Stress   Anchor- Right  
	  Anchor  constraints  must  be  gradient  alignment  constraints  since  like  reduplication  they  can  be  displa ced f rom  
left edge of word for prosodic reasons; cf.  Russian  Antonina  &gt;  Ton- a where Onset   Anchor(Align) -Left  
  Alber  proposes  using  lower  ranked  Anchor  Right  in  place  of  Max  since  if  the  latter  counts  segments  then  we  
(apparently  falsely) predict  a  bimoraic sy  llable  template  seeking  out  the  largest  phone me-wise  string  under  a  
Max-BT   Anchor -Left  ranking:  Carmela  &gt;  Carm  but  Petrosilla  &gt;  Tros  
	  Under  Anchor -Left   Anchor -Right    Max-BT,  the  parse  will  not  displace  from  left  edge;  but  Anchor -R will  still  
maximize  template  (consistent  with  the  dominating  metrical  size-restrictor constraints)

          <text>1  24.961 Prosodic  Morphology -1  
1.  morphology  
  the  prototypical  morphological  operation  is a ffixation  to  a  base.   
	  usually  the  process  applies  independently  of  the  phonology  of  the  base:  
   be-ing, hit- ing, comput -ing, backtrack -ing, prefix -ing.    
 
2.  but  sometimes  the  base  must  have  certain p  honological  properties  
   a. size requirements   
  English comparative  affixes  to  short  bases:  red-er,  yellow -er,  *corrupt -er,*beautiful -er   
  how  is  size measured?  
  b. truncations for hypocoristics   
  Pmela  &gt;  Pam;  Elzabeth  -&gt; Liz;  Samntha  -&gt; Sam;  profssor  -&gt; prof;  professional  &gt; pro  
  how  small  can the  truncate  be?  
  what  portion  of  the  base  is  truncated : Samntha  &gt; Sam, Elzabeth  &gt; *Zab  
 c.  infixation o  f  affix  inside  base:

  abot   um-abot   'reach'     
salat    s-um-alat   write   
sulat   s-um-ulat  'read'   
preno   pr-um-eno  'brake'    
gradwet   gr-um-adwet  'graduate'   
 
  where  is  the  infix  positioned?  
 d.  reduplication:  some  portion of  the  base  is  copied to mark the  morphological  category

  what  is  the  size  and  shape  of  the  reduplicant?

6.  OT  translation  
	  Templates  are  not  stipulated  but  ideally  emerge  from  the  constraint  hierarchy;  various  proposals  
	  Copying  operation  formalized  as  a  correspondence  (faithfulness)  relation  between  template  and base  
	  Maximizing  template:  penalizes  lack  of  correspondence  between  template  and  base   
	  Directionality:  Anchor  (alignment)  constraints  tell  where  copying  begins   
	  Truncatum  and  base  word  form  a  paradigm  
	  TETU  (The  emergence  of  the  unmarked);  since  B-T correspondence  is  an  Output -Output  relation  and  B-R 
correspondence  is  a  syntagmatic (string -internal) relation both differ from Input -Output  correspondence  and  
hence  can have  different  ranking  of  F  to  M:  IO-F   M   BT-F  
 
7.  Correspondence  Constraints  (McCarthy  &amp;  Prince  1995)  
 
MAX    Every  element  of  S1 has  a  correspondent  in S2.   
DEP  Every  element  of  S2 has  a  correspondent  in S1.  
IDENT (F)  Corresponent  segments have  identical  values for  the  feature  F.  
CONTIGUITY   
 a.  I-CONTIG (No S  kipping)  The  portion  of S 1 standing  in  correspondence forms a contiguous string.   
 b.  O-CONTIG (No I  ntrusion)  The  portion o  f S2 standing  in  correspondence forms a  contiguous string.   
 {RIGHT , LEFT}-A NCHOR (S1, S2) Any  element  at  the d esignated  periphery  of S 1 has  a  correspondent  at  the 
   designated  periphery of  S2.  
LINEARITY   No Metathesis S 1 is consistent with the precedence structure of S 2, and vice versa.  
UNIFORMITY   No Coalescence No element of S 2 has  multiple  correspondents  in S1.  
INTEGRITY   No Breaking N o element  of  S1 has  multiple  correspondents  in S2.
