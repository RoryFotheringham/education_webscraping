2 Subsequent Work 
 A number of papers have extended this work in a number of directions: 
	  Other countries: Mitra, Thomakos and Ulubasoglu (ReStat 2002) on 
Turkey and McCalman (RIE 2002) on Australia. Turkey paper has 
democracy vs dictatorship element to it. 
	  Mobarak and Purbasari (2006): rm-level import licenses and con
nections to Suharto in Indonesia. 
	  Heterogeneous rms and how organized an industrys lobbying is: 
Bombardini (JIE 2008) 
	  What do governments maximize? (ie estimates of a around the 
world): Gawande, Krishna and Olarreaga (2009). 
 	 Nunn and Treer (2009): rich/growing countries appear to put tar
is relatively more on skill-intensive goods. Perhaps this is because 
countries with good institutions have low a, and they recognize that 
skill-intensive sectors (might) have more positive externalities (eg 
knowledge spillovers) to them. 
 	 Freund and Ozden (AER, 2008): GH (1994) with loss aversion and 
application to US steel price pass-through.</text>

1.1.1 Treer (JPE 1993) 
	 Treer (1993) conducts a similar empirical exercise to Baldwin (1985), but 
for: 
	 Focus on NTB coverage ratios (the proportion of imports in an 
industry that are subject to any sort of NTB) rather than taris. 
This is attractive since US taris are so low in this period that there 
isnt much variation. Also true that taris (being under the remit of 
GATT/WTO) are constrained by international agreements in a way 
that NTBs are not. 
	 Attention to endogeneity issues and specication issues: 
	 Simultaneity: Protection depends on import penetration ratio 
(IPR) but IPR depends on protection. 
	 Truncation: IPR cant go negative. NTB coverage ratio cant go 
negative.

          <text>1.2 Second Generation Empirical Work 
 	 Grossman and Helpman (Protection for Sale, AER 1994) provided a 
clean theoretical GE (the economy is not really GE, but the lobbying 
of one industry does aect the lobbying of another) model that deliv
ered an equation for industry-level equilibrium protection as a function of 
industry-level observables:
ti  z 1 z= 1+ ti  L   
i + iIi   . (1)a + L ei a + L  
ei

          <text>ti is the ad valorem tari rate in industry i. 
	  Ii is a dummy for whether industry i is organized or not. 
	  0  L  1 is the share of the population that is organized into 
lobbies. 
	  a&gt;0  is the weight that the government puts on social welfare relative 
to aggregate political contributions (whose weight is 1). 
 	 zi is the inverse import penetration ratio. 
 	 ei is the elasticity of import demand. 
1.2.1 Goldberg and Maggi (1999) 
 	 There a host of key challenges in taking the GH (1994) equation to the 
data: 
 	 How to measure ti? Ideally want NTBs (not set cooperatively under 
GATT/WTO) measured in tari equivalents. Absent this GM (1999) 
use coverage ratios, as in Treer (1993). They experiment with dif
ferent proportionality constants (1/) between coverage ratios and t 
and also correct for censoring of coverage ratios. 
	  Data on ei is obviously hard to get. GM (1999) use existing estimates 
but also consider them as measured with error, so GM (1999) take 
ei over to the LHS. 
	  More challenges: 
	  How to measure Ii? Can get data on total political contributions in 
the US by industry (by law these are supposed to be reported), but all 
industries have at least some contributions, so all seem organized. 
GM (1999) experiment with dierent cutos in this variable. This 
isnt innocuous since contributions are endogenous in the GH (1994) 
model. GM (1999) use as instruments for Ii a set of typical Baldwin 
(1985)-style regressors, ie Treers N equation. 
 	 zi is endogenous (as Treer (1993) highlighted). GM (1999) use 
Treer-style instruments for zi (Treers M equation).

Class notes on 5/13/20131 
Explaining Trade Policy 
	 Gawande and Krishna (Handbook chapter, 2003) have a nice survey of 
this literature. 
	 If, by an overwhelming consensus among economists, trade should be 
free, then why is it that nearly everywhere we look, and however far back, 
trade is in chains? 
	 One answer: even in a neoclassical economy, trade policy might be 
optimal for a non-SOE. (Broda, Limao and Weinstein (2008) have 
recently improved support for this claim, as we will discuss later). 
	 Another answer: we live in an imperfectly competitive world where 
it is possible that even a SOE would want import taris/export sub
sidies. (Helpman and Krugman, 1987 book). 
	 Political economy answer: governments dont maximize social wel
fare. 
1.1 First Generation Empirical work I 
	 This body of work was impressive and large, but it always suered from 
a lack of strong theoretical input that would suggest: 
	 What regression to run. 
	 What the coecients in a regression would be telling us. 
	 What endogeneity problems seem particulary worth worrying about. 
	 Still, theory provided some input, such as: 
	 Pressure Group model: Olson (1965) on collective action problems 
within lobby groups. Suggests concentration as empirical proxy. 
	 Adding machine model: Caves (1976) has workers voting for their 
industries. Suggests L force as proxy. 
	 Social change model: governments aim to reduce income inequality. 
Suggests wage rate as proxy. 
	 Comparative cost model: lobbies have nite resources and decide 
what to lobby for (between protection and other policies). Suggests 
that the import penetration ratio should matter.

          <text>Treer (1993) estimates the following system by FIML: 
	 Where N = M M + XN N + N , M = N N + XM M + M , N is the 
NTB coverage ratio and M is the import penetration ratio. 
	 X N is Baldwin (1985) style variables explaining protection. 
	 X M is H-O style variable explaining trade ows.

	 BL (2012) look for an even that removed a locations natural (i.e. exoge
nous) productivity advantage/amenity. 
	 If there are no agglomeration externalities then this location will suer 
from this removal. 
	 But if there are agglomeration externalities then this location might not 
suer much at all. Its future success is assured through the logic of multiple 
equilibria. (This is typically referred to as path dependence.) 
	 What is the natural advantage that got removed from some locations? 
	 BL (2012) look at portage sites: locations where portage (i.e. the trans
shipment of goods from one type of boat to another type of boat) took 
place before the construction of canals/railroads. Prior to canals/railroads 
portage was extremely labor-intensive so portage sites were a source of 
excess labor demand. 
	 What is an exogenous source for a portage site? BL (2012) use the fall 
line, a geological feature indicating the point at which (in the US) navi
gable rivers leaving the ocean would rst become unnavigable

Fall-Line Cities from North Carolina to New Jersey
 
The map in the left panel shows the contemporary distribution of economic 
activity across the southeastern United States measured by the 2003 nighttime 
lights layer from NationalAtlas.gov. The nighttime lights are used to present 
a nearly continuous measure of present-day economic activity at a high spatial 
frequency. The fall line (solid) is digitized from Physical Divisions of the United 
States , produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. Major rivers (dashed gray) are 
from NationalAtlas.gov, based on data produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
Contemporary fall-line cities are labeled in the right panel.

Population Density in 2000 along Fall-Line Rivers
 
These graphs display contemporary population density along fall-line rivers. 
We select census 2000 tracts whose centroids lie within 50 miles along fall-line 
rivers; the horizontal axis measures distance to the fall line, where the fall line 
is normalized to zero, and the Atlantic Ocean lies to the left. In Panel A, these 
distances are calculated in miles. In Panel B, these distances are normalized for 
each river relative to the river mouth or the river source. The raw population data 
are then smoothed via Statas lowess procedure, with bandwidths of 0.3 (Panel A) 
or 0.1 (Panel B).

	 DW (2002) ask whether regions/cities population levels respond to one-o 
shocks 
	 The application is to WWII bombing in Japan 
	 Their ndings are surprising and have been replicated in many other set
tings: 
	 Germany (WWII): Brakman, Garretsen and Schramm (2004) 
	 Vietnam (Vietnam war): Miguel and Roland (2011) 
	 ... 
	 Davis and Weinstein (J Reg. Sci., 2008) extend the analysis in DW (2002) 
to the case of the fate of industry-locations. This is doubly interesting as 
it is plausible that industrial activity is mobile across space in ways that 
people are not.

Notes. This table displays estimates of equation 1, with the below noted modications. In Panels A and B, the outcome variables are historical factor densities, as noted in the 
column headings. The main explanatory variable is a dummy for proximity to a historical portage. Panel B also controls for historical population density. In Panel C, the outcome 
variable is 2000 population density, measured in natural logarithms, and the explanatory variables are portage proximity and the historical factor density noted in the column 
heading. Each panel/column presents estimates from a separate regression. The sample consists of all U.S. counties, in each historical year, that are within the watersheds of rivers 
that cross the fall line. The estimator used is OLS, with standard errors clustered on the 53 watersheds. The basic specication includes a polynomial in latitude and longitude, a set 
of xed effects by the watershed of each river that crosses the fall line, and dummies for proximity to the fall line and to a river. Reporting of additional coefcients is suppressed. 
Data sources and additional variable and sample denitions are found in the text and appendixes.

Class notes on 5/1/20131 
Krugman (JPE, 1991) 
	 This is an extremely inuential paper on a theory of economic geography 
(8,500 cites). 
	 It formalizes, in an extremely simple and clear manner, one particular form 
of agglomeration externality: that which arises with the combination of 
IRTS in production and trade costs. 
	 At a more prosaic level, this is just Krugman (1980) with the added as
sumption of free labor mobility.

	 Agriculture: CRTS, freely traded, workers immobile geographically 
	 Manufacturing: IRTS (Dixit-Stiglitz with CES preferences), iceberg 
trade costs , mobile workers 
	 Cobb-Douglas preferences between A and M sectors 
	 Basic logic can have other interpretations: 
	 Krugman and Venables (QJE, 1995): immobile factors but input-
output linkages between two Dixit-Stiglitz sectors 
	 Baldwin (1999): endogenous factor accumulation rather than factor 
mobility

The map in the upper panel shows the contemporary distribution of economic 
activity across the southeastern United States, measured by the 2003 nighttime 
lights layer from NationalAtlas.gov. The nighttime lights are used to present a 
nearly continuous measure of present-day economic activity at a high spatial 
frequency. The fall line (solid) is digitized from Physical Divisions of the United 
States , produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. Major rivers (dashed gray) are 
from NationalAtlas.gov, based on data produced by the United States Geological 
Survey. Contemporary fall-line cities are labeled in the lower panel.

          <text>This is attractiveafter all, the main point that HMR (2008) is mak
ing is that rm-level realities matter for aggregate ows. 
	 CKs rm data has exports to foreign countries in it (CK focus only on 
adjacent countries: Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain and Italy). 
3.1 CK (2010): Identication 
	 But interestingly, CK also know where the rm is in France. 
	 So they try to separately identify the eects of variable and xed trade 
costs by assuming: 
	 Variable trade costs are proportional to distance. Since each rm is 
a dierent distance from, say, Belgium, there is cross-rm variation 
here. 
	 Fixed trade costs are homogeneous across France for a given export 
destination. (It costs just as much to gure out how to sell to the 
Swiss whether your French rm is based in Geneva or Normandy). 
3.2 CK (2010): The model and estimation 
	 The model is deliberately close to Chaney (2008), which is a particular ver
sion of the Melitz (2003) model but with (unbounded) Pareto-distributed 
rm productivities (with shape parameter ). We will see this model in 
detail in the next lecture. 
	 In Chaney (2008) the elasticity of trade ows with respect to variable 
trade costs (proxies for by distance here, if we assume ij = ij whereD 
D = distance) can be subdivided into the: 
EXTj	 Extensive elasticity:  =  [  (  1)]. CK estimate this by Dij 
regressing rm-level entry (ie a Probit) on rm-level distance Dij and 
a rm xed eect. This is analogous to HMRs rst stage. 
INTj	 Intensive elasticity:  = (  1). CK estimate this by re-Dij 
gressing rm-level exports on rm-level distance Dij and a rm xed 
eect. This is analogous to HMRs second stage. 
	 Recall that  is the Pareto parameter governing rm heterogeneity. 
	 The above two equations (HMRs rst and second stage) dont separately 
identify ,  and . 
	 So to identify the model, CK bring in another equation which is the 
slope of the rm size (sales) distribution.

	 EKK (2009) construct a Melitz (2003)-like model in order to try to capture 
the key features of French rms exporting behavior: 
	 Whether to export. (Simple extensive margin). 
	 Which countries to export to. (Country-wise extensive margins). 
	 How much to export to each country. (Intensive margin). 
	 They uncover some striking regularities in the rm-wise sales data in (mul
tiple) foreign markets. 
	 These power law like relationships occur all over the place (Gabaix 
(ARE survey, 2009)). 
	 Most famously, they occur for domestic sales within one market. 
	 In that sense, perhaps its not surprising that they also occur market 
by market abroad. (At the heart of power laws is scale invariance.)

          <text>The HMR (2008) theory suggests (and solves) two sources of bias in the 
typical estimation of gravity equations (which neglects wij ). 
	 Second: A selection eect induced by only working with non-zero trade 
ows: 
	 HMRs gravity equation, like those before it, cant be estimated on 
the observations for which Mij =0 . 
	 The HMR theory tells us that the existence of these zeros is not as 
good as random with respect to dij , so econometrically this selection 
eect needs to be corrected/controlled for. 
	 Intuitively, the problem is that far away destinations are less likely 
to be protable, so the sample of zeros is selected on the basis of dij . 
	 This calls for a standard Heckman (1979) selection correction. 
2.4 HMR (2008): Two-step Estimation 
1. Estimate probit for zero trade ow or not: 
	 Include exporter and importer xed eects, and dij . 
	 Can proceed with just this, but then identication (in Step 2) is 
achieved purely o of the normality assumption. 
	 To strengthen identication, need additional variable that enters 
Probit in step 1, but does not enter Step 2. 
	 Theory says this should be a variable that aects the xed cost of 
exporting, but not the variable cost. 
	 HMR use Djankov et al (QJE, 2002)s entry regulation index. Also 
try common religion dummy. 
2. Estimate gravity equation on positive trade ows: 
	 Include inverse Mills ratio (standard Heckman trick) to control for 
selection problem (Second source of bias) 
	 Also include empirical proxy for wij based on estimate of entry equa
tion in Step 1 (to x First source of bias).

Class notes on 3/20/20131 
Intensive and Extensive Margins in Trade Flows 
	 With access to micro data on trade ows at the rm-level, a key question 
to ask is whether trade ows expand over time (or look bigger in the 
cross-section) along the: 
	 Intensive margin: the same rms (or product-rms) from country i 
export more volume (and/or charge higher priceswe can also de
compose the intensive margin into these two margins) to country j. 
	 Extensive margin: new rms (or product-rms) from country i are 
penetrating the market in country j. 
	 This is really just a decompositionwe can and should expect trade to 
expand along both margins. 
	 Recently some papers have been able to look at this. 
	 A rough lesson from these exercises is that the extensive margin seems 
more important (in a purely accounting sense, not necessarily a 
causal sense). 
1The notes are based on lecture slides with inclusion of important insights emphasized 
during the class.

          <text>estimating trade costs later in the course, and gravity equations will 
loom large. 
	 HMR (2008) started wave of thinking about gravity equation estimation 
in the presence of extensive/intensive margins. 
	 They use aggregate international trade (so this paper doesnt tech
nically belong in a lecture on rm-level trade empirics!) to explore 
implications of a heterogeneous rm model for gravity equation esti
mation. 
	 The Melitz (2003) modelwhich youll see properly next weekis 
simplied and used as a tool to understand, estimate, and correct for 
biases in gravity equation estimation. 
2.1 HMR (2008): Zeros in Trade Data 
	 HMR start with the observation that there are lots of zeros in interna
tional trade data, even when aggregated up to total bilateral exports. 
	 Baldwin and Harrigan (2008) and Johnson (2008) look at this in a 
more disaggregated manner and nd (unsurprisingly) far more zeros. 
	 Zeros are interesting. 
	 But zeros are also problematic. 
	 A typical analysis of trade ows is based on the gravity equation (in 
logs), which cant incorporate Xij =0 
	 Indeed, other models of the gravity equation (Armington, Krugman, 
Eaton-Kortum) dont have any zeros in them (due to CES and un
bounded productivities and nite trade costs).

First-stage estimation of the trade equation using Tobit (column (3) in Table 1). Bootstrapped standard errors in 
square parentheses (200 replications). FMA i is Foreign Market Access obtained from the trade equation 
estimation and defined in Eq. (17); DMA i(3) is our preferred measure of Domestic Market Access that uses 
internal area information but allows the coefficient on internal distance to be lower than that on external distance 
in the trade equation estimation. See Appendix A for definitions of and sources for the control variables. The 
availability of the hydrocarbons per capita and risk of expropriation data reduces the sample size in columns (1)  
(4) to 91 observations. The regional dummies in columns (5) and (6) are Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and 
the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Other Asia, and Eastern Europe and the 
former USSR. The excluded category is the industrialized countries of North America, Western Europe, and 
Oceania. See Appendix A for the country composition of each regional grouping. The excluded exogenous 
variables in columns (2) and (4) are log distance from the US, log distance from Belgium (as a central point in the 
European Union), and log distance from Japan. Sargan is a Sargan test of the models overidentifying restrictions. 
In column (7), FMA is computed using all countries, estimation on the non-OECD. In column (8), FMA is 
computed excluding non-OECD countries, estimation on the non-OECD.

Note. The table reports results from tting several versions of eq. (8). Specically, entries are from a regression 
of the natural log of output on the natural log of inputs, year by two-digit SIC xed effects, plant xed effects, and 
case xed effects. In model 1, two additional dummy variables are included for whether the plant is in a winning county 
7 to 1 years before the MDP opening or 0 to 5 years after. The reported mean shift indicates the difference in these 
two coefcients, i.e., the average change in TFP following the opening. In model 2, the same two dummy variables are 
included along with pre- and post-trend variables. The shift in level and trend are reported, along with the pre-trend 
and the total effect evaluated after 5 years. In cols. 1, 2, and 5, the sample is composed of all manufacturing plants in 
the ASM that report data for 14 consecutive years, excluding all plants owned by the MDP rm. In these models, 
additional control variables are included for the event years outside the range from t p -7 through t p 5 (i.e., -20 
to -8 and 6 to 17). Column 2 adds the case xed effects that equal one during the period that t ranges from -7 
through 5. In cols. 3 and 4, the sample is restricted to include only plants in counties that won or lost an MDP . This 
forces the industry by year xed effects to be estimated solely from plants in these counties. For col. 4, the sample is 
restricted further to include only plant by year observations within the period of interest (where t ranges from -7t o 
5). This forces the industry by year xed effects to be estimated solely on plant by year observations that identify the 
parameters of interest. In col. 5, a set of 47 plant openings in the entire country were randomly chosen from the ASM 
in the same years and industries as the MDP openings (this procedure was run 1,000 times, and reported are the means 
and standard deviations of those estimates). For all regressions, plant by year observations are weighted by the plants 
total value of shipments 8 years prior to the opening. Plants not in a winning or losing county are weighted by their 
total value of shipments in that year. All plants from two uncommon two-digit SIC values were excluded so that estimated 
clustered variance-covariance matrices would always be positive denite. In brackets is the value in 2006 U.S. dollars 
from the estimated increase in productivity: the percentage increase is multiplied by the total value of output for the 
affected incumbent plants in the winning counties. Reported in parentheses are standard errors clustered at the county 
level.

1	  Geographic Concentration of Industry: Elli
son and Glaeser (JPE, 1997) 
	  EG (1997) asks: Just how concentrated is economic activity within any 
given industry in the US? 
 	 Key point: What is the right null hypothesis? 
 	 If output, within an industry, is highly concentrated in a small num
ber of plants, then that industry will look very concentrated spatially, 
simply by nature of the small number of plants. (Consider extreme 
case of one plant.) 
 	 EG develop an index (denoted  a n dn o w k n o w na s t h eE Gi n d e x  ) o f 
localization that considers as its null hypothesis the random location of 
plants within an industry. They call this a dartboard approach. 
 	 We dont have time to go into the denition of , but see the paper 
for that. 
 	 See also Duranton and Overman (ReStud, 2005) on an axiomatic 
approach to generalizing the EG index to correct for the lumpiness 
of locations in the data. 
1.1 EG (1997): Results 
 	 For industries that we might expect to be highly localized: 
 	 Autos:  =0.127 
 	 Auto parts:  =0.089 
 	 Carpets (ie Dalton, GA):  =0.378 
 	 Electronics (ie Silicon Valley):  =0.059  0.142 
 	 For industries that we might expect to be highly localized: 
 	 Bottled/canned soft drinks:  =0.005 
 	 Newspaper:  =0.002 
 	 Concrete:  =0.012

	 ARSW (2013) develop a similar approach to RS (2008) but to the case of 
the division (and reunication) of Berlin. So this is about the importance 
of proximity at a very dierent spatial scale (neighborhoods rather than 
regions). 
	 Paper looks at the eect of the loss of access/proximity to the downtown 
region (CBD/Mitte), which was in East Berlin, on neighborhoods of 
West Berlin. And then the reverse for reunication. 
	 Model is similar to RS (2008) but with some alterations: 
	 Commuting costs that vary with distance. This is modeled in the 
standard logit fashion where workers places of residence are xed 
but they then receive exogenous utility shocks for each location and 
they choose the utility maximizing work location (as a function of 
the utility shocks, the wage, and the commuting cost). 
	 No trade costs (the logic here is that most of what was produced in 
Berlin was exported to the rest of the world anyway. 
	 Consumer amenities that depend on an exogenous local term (as in 
RS, 2008) and a distance-weighted sum of all other regions popula
tions. 
	 Production externalities that depend on an exogenous local term and 
a distance-weighted sum of all other regions employment .

Note. The table reports results from tting three regressions. In panel A, the dependent variables are the log of 
number of establishments and the log of total manufacturing output in the county, based on data from the Census of 
Manufactures. Controls include county, year, and case xed effects. Reported are the county-level difference-in-difference 
estimates for receiving an MDP opening. Because data are available every 5 years, depending on the census year relative 
to the MDP opening, the sample years are dened to be 15 years before the MDP opening and 48 years after the 
MDP opening. Thus, each MDP opening is associated with one earlier date and one later date. The col. 1 model is 
weighted by the number of plants in the county in years -6t o -10, and the col. 2 model is weighted by the countys 
total manufacturing output in years -6t o -10. In panel B, the dependent variable is log wage and controls include 
dummies for age by year, age squared by year, education by year, sex by race by Hispanic by citizen, and case xed 
effects. Reported is the county-level difference-in-difference estimate for receiving an MDP opening. Because data are 
available every 10 years, the sample years are dened to be 110 years before the MDP opening and 312 years after 
the MDP opening. As in panel A, each MDP opening is associated with one earlier date and one later date. The sample 
is restricted to individuals who worked more than 26 weeks in the previous year, usually work more than 20 hours per 
week, are not in school, are at work, and work for wages in the private sector. The number of observations reported 
refers to unique individuals: some Integrated Public Use Microdata Series county groups include more than one Federal 
Information Processing Standard (FIPS), so all individuals in a county group were matched to each potential FIPS. The 
same individual may then appear in more than one FIPS, and observations are weighted to give each unique individual 
the same weight. Reported in parentheses are standard errors clustered at the county level.

3.2 Market Access Approaches 
	 A large literature has considered how the economic activity of a region 
depends on that of other, nearby regions. 
	 A very common approach (to the challenge of parameterizing how one 
region aects another) is to work with the concept of market access. We 
will cover this approach now. 
	 MA is usually dened in the context of a one-sector Krugman (1980) 
model but an observationally equivalent expression would derive in any 
one-sector gravity model (including neoclassical models without any ex
ternalities). So while the MA approach is interesting it doesnt directly 
map to the estimation of agglomeration externalities. 
	 However, we will also discuss recent approaches that add agglomeration 
externalities on top of a one-sector gravity model such that there is now 
a genuine agglomeration externality that can be estimated.

Note. For each case to be weighted equally, counties are weighted by the inverse of their number per case. Similarly, plants are weighted by the inverse of their number per county multiplied 
by the inverse of the number of counties per case. The sample includes all plants reporting data in the ASM for each year between the MDP opening and 8 years prior. Excluded are all plants 
owned by the rm opening an MDP . Also excluded are all plants from two uncommon two-digit SIC values so that subsequently estimated clustered variance matrices would always be positive 
denite. The sample of all U.S. counties excludes winning counties and counties with no manufacturing plant reporting data in the ASM for 9 consecutive years. These other U.S. counties are 
given equal weight within years and are weighted across years to represent the years of MDP openings. Reported t-statistics are calculated from standard errors clustered at the county level. t-
statistics greater than 2 are reported in bold. All monetary amounts are in 2006 U.S. dollars.

Note. The table reports results from tting versions of eq. (9), which is modied from eq. (8). Building on the 
model 1 specication in col. 4 of table 5, each column adds interaction terms between winner/loser and pre/post 
status with the indicated measures of how an incumbent plants industry is linked to its associated MDPs industry (a 
continuous version of results in table 7). These industry linkage measures are dened and described in table 2, and 
here the measures are normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The sample of plants is 
that in col. 4 of table 5, but it is restricted to plants that have industry linkage data for each measure. For assigning 
this linkage measure, the incumbent plants industry is held xed at its industry the year prior to the MDP opening. 
Whenever a plant is a winner or loser more than once, it receives an additive dummy variable and interaction term 
for each occurrence. Reported in parentheses are standard errors clustered at the county level.

          <text>Broadly, three approaches: 
1. Estimating agglomeration economies directly 
2. Estimating agglomeration economies from the extent of agglomera
tion in an observed spatial equilibrium. 
3. Testing for multiple equilibria (which is often a consequence of ag
glomeration economies) 
3.1 Estimating agglomeration economies directly 
	 A large literature has argued that if agglomeration economies exist then 
units of production (and factors) should be more productive if they are 
surrounded by other producers 
	 Two recent, excellent examples: 
	 Henderson (2003, JUE) on across-rm (within-location) externalities 
	 Moretti (2004, AER) on local (within-city) human capital externali
ties 
	 A central challenge with this approach is an analogy to the challenge 
that faces the peer eects literature (e.g. Manski, 1993): does one unit 
actually aect a proximate unit, or are proximate units just similar on 
unobservable dimensions? 
	 Greenstone, Hornbeck and Moretti (JPE, 2010) consider a natural exper
iment approach to this question. 
	 See also Greenstone and Moretti (2004) on how the same natural 
experiment aected total county land values (i.e. a measure of the 
welfare eects of agglomeration economies). 
3.1.1 Greenstone, Hornbeck and Moretti (2010) 
	 GHM look at the eect that million dollar plants (huge industrial plants) 
have on incumbent rms in the vicinity of the new MDP 
	 Consider the following example (from paper): 
	 BMW did worldwide search for new plant location in 1991. 250 loca
tions narrowed to 20 US counties. Then announced 2 nalists: Om
aha, NB and Greenville-Spartanburg, SC. Finally, chose Greenville-
Spartanburg. 
	 Why? BMW says: 
	 Low costs of production: low union density, supply of quality 
workers, numerous global rms in area (including 58 German 
companies), good transport infrastructure (rail, air, highway, 
port access), and access to key local services.

Note: Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimates using twelve moment conditions based on the difference between the 
distance-weighted and unweighted mean and variance of production fundamentals and residential fundamentals. Distance weights use the distance of each West Berlin block from the pre-war CBD, inner boundary between East and West Berlin, and outer boundary between West Berlin and its East German hinterland. One-step estimates use the identity matrix as the weighting matrix. Two-step estimates use the efficient weighting matrix. Standard errors in parentheses. See the text of the paper for further 
discussion.

          <text>2. Some consumption amenity is exogenously or endogenously agglomerated 
	 Nice places to live (for place-based amenities that are non-tradable) 
	 People (i.e. workers) just like to live near each other 
	 Some non-tradable amenities that are endogenously provided but 
with IRTS in those goods production functions (e.g. opera houses) 
3. Some production input agglomerates endogenously 
	 Some positive externality (i.e. spillover) that depends on proximity. 
This almost surely explains Silicon Valley, Detroit, Boston biotech, 
carpets in Dalton, etc. 
	 This is what is usually meant by the term, agglomeration economies 
	 This source of agglomeration has attracted the greatest interest among 
economists. 
2.1 What are sources of possible agglomeration economies? 
	 The literature on this is enormous 
	 Probably begins in earnest with Marshall (1890) 
	 Recent survey in Duranton and Puga (2004, Handbook of Urban and 
Regional Econ) 
	 Typically 3 forces for potential agglomeration economies: 
1. Thick input markets (reduce search costs and idiosyncratic risk) 
2. Increasing returns to scale combined with trade costs (on either in
puts or outputs) that scale with remoteness 
3. Knowledge spillovers 
3	 Empirical work on the causes of agglomera
tion 
	 Recent surveys on this in: 
	 Redding (2010, J Reg. Sci. survey) 
	 Rosenthal and Strange (2004, Handbook of Urban and Regional Econ) 
	 Head and Mayer (2004, Handbook of Urban and Regional Econ)

Trade)

          <text>Basic estimation strategy: 
	 Basic principle is that this is a model with a parameter for agglom
eration externalities. ARSW then let the data, when fed through the 
model, identify that parameter. Analogous to approach summarized 
in Glaeser and Gottlieb (JEL, 2010)more detail in Glaesers 2009 
book of lectures on urban economicsor Allen and Arkolakis (2013). 
	 Formulate moments based on the identifying assumption that the 
(unobserved) production/consumption amenities (for each location) 
dont change over time in a way that is correlated with distance to 
the CBD. 
	 This eectively says that the only eect of distance-to-the-CBD is 
working through the models 3 distance-dependent terms (production 
externalities, consumption externalities, and commuting costs). 
	 Remarkably, there is sucient variation in these 3 terms to allow 
identication of 3 separate parameters.

	 DH (2013) also pursue a MA approach, in the context of studying the 
impact of railroads on the US economy (1870-1890) 
	 MA is not the focus here. Instead, the goal is to develop a regression 
approach for the study of railroad access on local prosperity (as measured 
through land values) that is robust to econometric spillovers. MA delivers 
this.

          <text>X1X2Figure 1: Consider a two sector economy with constant return to each factor.
In one factor case, the production possibility frontier is a straight line (black
solid line), so in equilibrium this factor must be used to produce goods in both
sectors. In two factors case, the production frontier has a kink (black dotted
line), at the kink, each factor is totally used to produce goods in a single sector.
When the number of factors increase, it s more likely to have "kinks", therefore
the allocation Lis more likely to be unique. If there is a continuum of factors
(as in the model), the unique allocation is generically true.

	 This was an important general point about estimating gravity equations 
	 And it is a nice example of general equilibrium empirical thinking. 
	 But AvW (2003) applied their method to revisit McCallum (AER, 1995)s 
famous argument that there was a huge border eect within North Amer
ica: 
	 This is an additional premium on crossing the border, controlling for 
distance. 
	 Ontario appears to want to trade far more with Alberta (miles away) 
than New York (close, but over a border). 
	 The problem is that, as AvW (2003) showed, McCallum (1995) didnt 
control for the endogenous terms Ak( , E)a n d Bjk( , E).i

Fan (1992) locally weighted regression, where the dependent variable is log payment at 
checkpoint, after removing checkpoint #month xed effects and trip xed effects, and 
the independent variable is the average percentile of the trip at which the checkpoint is 
encountered. The bandwidth is equal to one-third of the range of the independent var
iable. Dependent variable is log bribe paid at checkpoint. Bootstrapped 95 percent con
dence intervals are shown in dashes, where bootstrapping is clustered by trip. 
Measuring Trade Costs from Trade Flows 
	 Descriptive statistics can only get us so far. No one ever writes down the 
full extent of costs of trading and doing business afar. 
	 For example, in the realm of transportation-related trade costs: the 
full transportation-related cost is not just the freight rate (which 
Hummels (2007) presents evidence on) but also the time cost of goods 
in transit, etc. 
	 The most commonly-employed method (by far) for measuring the full 
extent of trade costs is the gravity equation. 
	 This is a particular way of inferring trade costs from trade ows. 
	 Implicitly, we are comparing the amount of trade we see in the real 
world to the amount wed expect to see in a frictionless world; the 
dierenceunder this logicis trade costs. 
	 Gravity models put a lot of structure on the model in order to (very 
transparently and easily) back out trade costs as a residual.

in
 the US. 
	 Hummels and Hilberry (EER, 2008) look at this on US trade data 
by checking whether imports of a zipcodes goos are correlated 
with the upstream input demands of that zipcodes industry-mix. 
	 Rossi-Hansberg (AER, 2005) models this on a spatial continuum 
where a border is just a line in space. 
	 Yi (JPE, 2003) looks at this. And Yi (AER, 2010) argues that 
this explains much of the border eect that remains even in 
AvW (2003).

          <text>4.1.1 Estimating k from the Gravity Equation: Determinants Apij 
proach 
k	 A more common approach to measuring ij is to give up on measuring the 
full , and instead parameterize  as a function of observables. 
	 The most famous implementation of this is to model TCs as a function of 
distance (Dij ): 
	 k = D 
ij ij . 
	 So we give up on measuring the full set of ijk s, and instead estimate 
just the elasticity of TCs with respect to distance, . 
	 How do we know that trade costs fall like this in distance? Eaton 
and Kortum (2002) use a spline estimator. 
	 But equally, one can imagine including a whole host of m determinants 
z(m) of trade costs:
 	 k = (z(m)k )m .ij m ij 
	 This functional form doesnt really have any microfoundations (that I 
know of). 
	 But this functional form certainly makes the estimation of m in a 
gravity equation very straightforward.

          <text>4.2.1 Other elements of Trade Costs 
	 Many determinants of TCs have been investigated in the literature. 
	 AvW (2004) summarize these: 
	 Taris, NTBs, etc. 
	 Transportation costs (directly measured). Roads, ports. (Feyrer 
(2009) on Suez Canal had this feature). 
	 Currency policies. 
	 Being a member of the WTO. 
	 Language barriers, colonial ties. 
	 Information barriers. (Rauch and Trindade (2002).) 
	 Contracting costs and insecurity (Evans (2001), Anderson and Mar
coulier (2002)). 
	 US CIA-sponsored coups. (Easterly, Nunn and Sayananth (2010).) 
	 Aggregating these trade costs together into one representative number is 
not trivial (assuming the costs dier across goods). 
	 Anderson and Neary (2005) have outlined how to solve this problem 
(conditional on a given theory of trade).

          <text>This is because (in such a model) the true trade ow-to-border cost 
elasticity will be larger than that in a standard model (without multi
stage production). 
4.7.1 Results 
	 Yi (2010) uses data on taris, NTBs, freight rates and wholesale distri
bution costs to claim that the true Canada-US border trade costs are 
14.8%. 
	 He then simulates (a calibrated version of) his model based on this true 
border cost. 
	 He then compares the border dummy coecient in 2 regressions: 
	 A gravity regression based on his models predicted trade data. 
	 And the gravity regression based on actual trade data. 
	 The coecient on the model regression is about 2/3 of the data regression. 
A trade cost of 26.1% would be needed for the coecients to match. 
	 By contrast, a standard Eaton and Kortum (2002) model equivalent 
(without multi-stage production) would give much smaller coherence 
between model and data.

Direct Measurement of Trade Costs 
	 The simplest way to measure TCs is to just go out there and measure 
them directly. 
	 Many components of TCs are probably measurable. But many arent. 
	 Still, this sort of descriptive evidence is extremely valuable for getting a 
sense of things. 
	 Examples of creative sources of this sort of evidence: 
	 Hummels (JEP, 2007) survey on transportation. 
	 Anderson and van Wincoop (JEL, 2004) survey on trade costs. 
	 Limao and Venables on shipping. 
	 Olken on bribes and trucking in Indonesia. 
	 Fafchamps (2004 book) on traders and markets in Africa.

          <text>4.1	 Estimating ijk from the Gravity Equation: Residual 
Approach 
	 One natural approach would be to use the above structure to back out 
what trade costs k must be. Lets call this the residual approach. ij 
	 Head and Ries (2001) propose a way to do this: 
	 Suppose that intra-national trade is free: k =1 . T h i s c a n b e ii 
thought of as a normalization of all trade costs (eg assume that AvW 
(2004)s distributional retail/wholesale costs apply equally to do
mestic goods and international goods (after the latter arrive at the 
port). 
 And suppose that inter-national trade is symmetric: k =  k 
ij ji. 
	 Then we have the phi-ness of trade:
 
Xk Xk 
ij ji k 
ij )1k = Xk Xk	 (1)ij  (k 
ii jj 
	 There are some drawbacks of this approach: 
	 We have to be able to measure internal trade, Xiik .( Y o u c a n d o t h i s 
if you observe gross output or nal expenditure in each i and k,a n d 
re-exporting doesnt get misclassied into the wrong sector.) 
	 We have to know . (But of course when were inferring prices from 
quantities it seems impossible to proceed without an estimate of sup-
ply/demand elasticities, i.e. the trade elasticity .)

          <text>4.2 Anderson and van Wincoop (AER, 2003) 
	 An important message about how one actually estimates the gravity equa
tion was made by AvW (2003). 
	 Suppose you are estimating the general gravity model: 
ln Xk
i ( , E)+ Bjk( , E)+ k ln k 
ij . (2)ij ( ,E)= Ak	 
ij + k 
	 You assume ijk = D and try to estimate k .ij 
	 Aside: Note that you cant actually estimate k here! All you can 
estimate is k  kk . But with outside information on k (in some 
models it is the CES parameter, which maybe we can estimate from 
another study) you can back out k . 
	 You are estimating the general gravity model: 
k ( ,E)= Ai	 ij + kln Xij k( , E)+ Bjk( , E)+ k ln k 
ij . (3) 
k)k 1 Note how Ak and Bjk (which are equal to Yik(k
i )k 1 and Ejk(Pj i 
krespectively in the AvW (2004) system) depend on ij too. 
	 Even in an endowment economy where Yik and Ejk are exogenous this 
kis a problem. The problem is the Pj and k terms.i 
	 These terms are the price index, which is very hard to get data on. 
k k	 So a naive regression of Xk on Ej , Y k and ij is usually performed ij i 
(this is AvWs traditional gravity) instead. 
	 AvW (2003) pointed out that this is wrong. The estimate of  will 
be biased by OVB (weve omitted the Pjk and k terms and they are i 
correlated with ijk ). 
	 How to solve this problem? 
	 AvW (2003) propose non-linear least squares: 
( t 1k 
)1k )1k k 	 The functions (k  Ejk 
and (Pk i jP k Y k jj ( t1k 
 k Y k 
i	 are known. i	 k Y k 
i 
	 These are non-linear functions of the parameter of interest (), 
but NLS can solve that. 
	 A simpler approach (rst in Harrigan (1996)) is usually pursued in
stead though: 
	 The terms Ak( , E)a n d Bk( , E) can be partialled out using k 
i j i 
and k xed eects. j

	 Yi (2003) motivates his paper with 2 puzzles: 
1. The trade ow-to-tari elasticity in the data is way higher than what 
standard models predict. 
2. The trade ow-to-tari elasticity in the data appears to have become 
much higher, non-linearly, around the 1980s. Why? 
	 Yi (2003) formulates and calibrates a 2-country DFS (1977)-style model 
with and without vertical specialization (ie intermediate inputs are re
quired for production, and these are tradable). 
	 The model without VS fails to match puzzles 1 or 2.

	 Contractual frictions. 
	 The need to secure trade nance (working capital while goods in 
transit). 
	 NB: There is no reason that these trade costs occur only on international 
trade. 
	 This point widens the 
2.1 Why care about trade costs? 
	 They enter many modern models of trade, so empirical implementations 
of these models need an empirical metric for trade costs. 
	 There are clear features of the international trade data that seem hard 
(but not impossible) to square with a frictionless world. 
	 As famously argued by Obstfeld and Rogo (Brookings, 2000), trade costs 
may explain the six big puzzles of international macro. 
	 Trade costs clearly matter for welfare calculations. 
	 Trade costs could be endogenous and driven by the market structure of 
the trading sector; this would aect the distribution of gains from trade. 
(A monopolist on transportation could extract all of the gains from trade.) 
2.2 Are Trade Costs Large? 
	 There is considerable debate (still unresolved) about this question. 
	 Arguments in favor: 
	 Trade falls very dramatically with distance (see Figures). 
	 Clearly haircuts are not very tradable but a song on iTunes is. Ev
erything else is in between. 
	 Contractual frictions of sale at a distance (Avner Griefs Fundamen
tal Problem of Exchange) seem potentially severe. 
	 One often hears the argument that a fundamental problem in devel
oping countries is their sclerotic infrastructure (ie ports, roads, etc). 
Economist article on traveling with a truck driver in Cameroon. 
	 Arguments against: 
	 Inter- and intra-national shipping rates arent that high: in March 
2010 (even at relatively high gas prices) a California-Boston refrig
erated truck journey cost around $5, 000. Fill this with grapes and 
they will sell at retail for around $100, 000.

          <text>4.3 A Concern About Identication 
	 The above methodology identied tau (or its determinants) only by as
suming trade separability. This seems potentially worrying. 
	 In particular, there is a set of taste or technology shocks that can ratio
nalize any trade cost vector you want. 
	 Eg if we allowed each country i to have its own taste for varieties of 
k that come from country j (this would be a demand shock shifter 
kin the utility function for i, aij ) then this would mean everywhere we 
k ksee ij a b o v es h o u l dr e a l l y b e k 
ij aij 
k k	 In general aij might just be noise with respect to determining ij . 
kBut if a is spatially correlated, as  k is (when, for example, we are ij	 ij 
projecting  on distance), then the estimation of  w o u l db eb i a s e d . 
	 To take an example from the Crozet and Koenigs (2009) maps, do Alsa
ciens trade more with Germany (relative to how the rest of France trades 
with Germany) because: 
	 They have low trade costs (proximity) for getting to Germany? 
	 They have tastes for similar goods? 
	 There is no barrier to factor mobility here. German barbers might 
even cut hair in France. 
	 Integrated supply chains choose to locate near each other.

3.2 FAO Data: Limitations 
	 Potentially realistic farming conditions that do not play a role in the FAO 
model: 
	 Increasing returns to scale in growth of one crop. 
	 Product dierentiation (vertical or horizontal) within crop categories. 
	 Sources of complementarities across crops: 
	 Farmers risk aversion. 
	 Crop rotation . 
	 Multi-cropping. 
	 Potentially realistic farming conditions that are inconsistent with CD 
(2012b)s application of the FAO model: 
	 Changing use of non-land factors of production in response to chang
ing prices of those factors. Introduces bias here if: 
	 Relative factor prices implicitly used by FAO model dier from 
those in US 1880-1997, 
	 and factor intensities dier across crops (among the crops that 
a county is growing).

          <text>Then two steps: 
1.	 Measuring Farm-gate Prices: 
	 We combine Census data on output and PPF to infer prices that 
farmers in local market i appear to have been facing. 
2.	 Measuring Gains from Integration: 
	 We compute the spatial distribution of price gaps between U.S. 
counties and New York/World in each year. 
	 We then ask: For any period t, how much higher (or lower) 
would the total value of US agricultural output in period t have 
been if price gaps were those from 1997 rather than those from 
period t? 
3.1.2 CD (2012b): Results 
	 Farm-gate price estimates look sensible: 
	 State-level price estimates correlate well with state-level price data. 
	 How large have been the gains that arose as counties became increasingly 
integrated? 
	 eg 1880-1920: 2.3 % growth (in agricultural GDP) per year

          <text>3.6 Summary 
	 CD (2012b) have developed a new approach to measuring the gains from 
economic integration based on Roy/Ricardian model. 
	 Central to the approach is use of novel agronomic data: 
	 Crucially, this source aims to provide counterfactual productivity data: 
productivity of all crops in all regions, not just the crops that are ac
tually being grown there. 
	 Have used this approach to estimate: 
1. County-level prices for 16 main crops, 1880-1997. 
2. Changes in spatial distribution of price gaps across U.S. counties from 
1880 to 1997: estimated gaps appear to have fallen over time. 
3. Gains	 associated with reductions in the level of these gaps of the 
same order of magnitude as productivity gains in agriculture 
4	 Climate Change and Agriculture: from Micro 
to Macro 
	 Voluminous agronomic literature establishes that climate change will hurt 
important crops in many locations on Earth

	 Portugal will produce wine

How Can One Solve This Identication Problem? 
2.1 Existing Approach 
	 Previous identication problem is emphasized by Deardor (1984) in his 
review of empirical work on the Ricardian model of trade 
	 A similar identication problem arises in labor literature in which self-
selection based on CA is often referred to as the Roy model 
	 Heckman and Honore (1990): if general distributions of worker skills 
are allowed, the Roy model has no empirical content 
	 One Potential Solution: 
	 Make untestable functional form assumptions about distribu
tions 
	 Use these assumptions to relate observable to unobservable produc
tivity 
	 Examples: 
	 In a labor context: Log-normal distribution of worker skills 
	 In a trade context: Fr echet distributions across countries and indus
tries 
2.2 This Papers Approach 
	 Focus on sector in which scientic knowledge of how essential inputs map 
into outputs is uniquely well understood: agriculture 
	 As a consequence of this knowledge, agronomists can predict the produc
tivity of a eld if it were to grow any one of a set of crops 
	 In this particular context, we know the productivity of a eld in all 
economic activities, not just those in which it is currently employed

	 Agronomists provide very detailed micro-level estimates 
	 Predictions about implications of climate change for crop yields, crop 
by crop and location by location 
	 Goal of this paper is to aggregate up micro-agronomic estimates in order 
to shed light an important macro-economic question: 
	 What will be the global impact of climate change on the 
agricultural sector? 
4.1 The Impact of Climate Change in a Globalized World 
	 Analysis in CD (2012c) builds on one simple observation: 
	 When countries can trade, the impact of micro-level shocks 
does not only depend on their average level, but also on 
their dispersion over space, i.e., their eect on comparative 
advantage 
	 Basic idea: 
	 A wheat farmer cares not only about what CC does to his wheat 
yields 
	 He also cares about what CC does to the yields of the crops that he 
could have produced as well as their (relative) prices, which depend 
on how other farmers (relative) yields are aected around the world 
	 Note: This is not trade as adaptation: 
	 Trade openness can mitigate the ill-eects of climate change if it leads 
to more heterogeneity in productivity within and between countries 
	 Trade openness can exacerbate the ill-eects of climate change if it 
leads to less heterogeneity in productivity within and between coun
tries

3.1.7 Two Steps of Analysis 
	 Recall that CD (2012b) break analysis down into two steps: 
1.	 Measuring Farm-gate Prices: 
	 Combine data on output (from the Census) and the PPF (from 
kthe FAO) to infer the crop prices (p) that farmers in local mar-it
ket i appear to have been facing. 
2.	 Measuring Gains from Integration: 
	 Compute price gaps (1 + k ) as the dierence between farm-gate it
prices and prices in wholesale markets. 
	 Then ask how much more productive a collection of local mar
kets i would be under a particular counterfactual integration 
scenario: all markets i face lower price gaps. 
	 Now describe how to do these steps in turn. 
Measuring Farm-gate Prices
 
Assumptions about technological change
 
fk  The FAO aims for its measures of counterfactual productivity ( A ) to i,2011
be relevant today (ie in 2011). But how relevant are these measures for 
fk true technology (A) in, eg, 1880? it 
	 With data on both output and land use, by crop, CD (2012b) need only 
the following assumption: 
fk fk = k Ait itA , for all k = 1, ..., K, f  Fi.i,2011

          <text>2.2.1 Basic Theoretical Environment 
	 The basic environment is the same as in the purely Ricardian part of 
Costinot (2009) 
	 Consider a world economy comprising: 
	 c = 1, ..., C countries 
	 g = 1, ..., G goods [crops in our empirical analysis] 
	 f = 1, ..., F factors of production [elds, or pixels, in our empirical 
analysis] 
 Factors are immobile across countries, perfectly mobile across sectors 
 Lcf  0 denotes the inelastic supply of factor f in country c 
	 Factors of production are perfect substitutes within each country and sec
tor, but vary in their productivities Ag  0cf 
2.2.2 Cross-Sectional Variation in Output 
	 Total output of good g in country c is given by 
FF 
Qg Ag Lg= c cf cf 
f =1 
	 Take producer prices pg  0 as given and focus on the allocation thatc 
maximizes total revenue at these prices 
	 Assuming that this allocation is unique, can express output as 
F 
Qg Ag 
c = cf Lcf (1) 
fFcg 
where Fg is the set of factors allocated to good g in country c:c 
  g  Fg = { f = 1, ...F | Ag /Ag&gt;p /pg if g= g} (2)c	 cf cf c c 
2.2.3 Data Requirements 
	 CD (2012a)s test of Ricardos ideas requires data on: 
	 Actual output levels, which we denote by QQg 
c 
	 Data to compute predicted output levels, which we denote by Qg

          <text>In a Trade context, counterfactual scenarios typically involve the reallo
cation of multiple factors of production towards dierent economic 
activities. 
	 Hence researcher requires knowledge of counterfactual productivity of 
factors if they were employed in sectors in which producers are currently, 
and deliberately, not using them (Deardor, 1984). 
	 Any study of the gains from economic integration needs to overcome 
this identication problem. 
3.1 How to Overcome Identication Problem? 
	 Four main approaches in the literature: 
	 Reduced form approach (e.g. Frankel and Romer 1999): knowledge 
of CF obtained by observing behavior of similar but open countries. 
	 Autarky approach (e.g. Bernhofen and Brown, 2005): autarky 
prices, when observed, are useful. 
	 Sucient statistic approach (e.g. Chetty, 2009): knowledge of CF 
technologies unnecessary (for small changes) because gains from re
allocation of production are second-order at optimum. 
	 Structural approach (e.g. Eaton and Kortum 2002): knowledge of 
CF obtained by extrapolation based on (untestable) functional forms. 
	 Basic idea of CD (2012b): 
	 Develop new structural approach with weaker need for extrapolation 
by functional form assumptions. 
	 Focus on sector of the economy with unique scientic knowledge of 
both factual and counterfactual productivity: agriculture. 
3.1.1 CD (2012b): Method 
	 Consider a panel of 1,500 U.S. counties from 1880 to 1997. 
	 Choose US for long sweep of high-quality, comparable micro-data 
from important agricultural economy. 
	 Use Roy/Ricardian model + FAO data to construct PPF in each county.

          <text>3 2.2.7 Concluding Remarks 
	 Ricardos theory of CA is one of the oldest and most distinguished theories 
in economics, but it is a dicult theory to test 
	 To do so using conventional data sources, one needs to make untestable 
functional form assumptions 
	 CD (2012a) has argued that the predictions of agronomists can provide 
missing data required to test Ricardos ideas 
	 And then CD (2012a) have shown that output levels predicted by Ricardos 
theory of CA correlate surprisingly, but not that strongly, with those that 
are observed in the data 
How Large are the Gains from Economic In
tegration? 
	 Regions of the world, both across and within countries, appear to have 
become more economically integrated with one another over time. 
	 Two natural questions arise: 
1. How large have been the gains from this integration? 
2. How large are the gains from further integration? 
	 Fundamental challenge lies in predicting how local markets would behave 
under counterfactual scenarios in which they become more or less in
tegrated with rest of the world.

tion)

	 To do so CD (2012b) allow unrestricted county-crop-year specic 
productivity shocks. 
2. Highest resolution output data available (from Census) is at county-level. 
	 So direct predictions from high-resolution FAO model, pixel by pixel, 
are not testable. 
3. Land (though heterogeneous) is the only factor of production. 
	 Should think of land as equipped land

Class notes on 2/27/20131 
Introduction 
	 Today we look at Ricardian models from a slightly dierent perspective. 
	 In all of todays applications we will study economies where: 
	 Each fundamental production unit uses one factor (land). This is of 
course Ricardian. 
	 But the observable production units are comprised of many such 
fundamental production units, each of which is unique (i.e. the type 
of land is dierent). 
	 Fundamental production units combine as perfect substitutes to gen
erate output at the observable level. 
	 So at the level of the observable production unit, this is an assign
ment model of the comparative advantage and Ricardian sort. 
	 See Costinot (Econometrica, 2009) for a discussion. Related also to 
David Autors recent (2013) survey of the task-based approach to 
studying labor markets, and to Grossmans recent (2013) survey of 
trade models with heterogeneous workers. 
Motivation: A Famous Anecdote 
	 Stan Ulam once asked Paul Samuelson: Name one proposition in the 
social sciences that is both true and non-trivial 
	 Paul Samuelsons reply: Ricardos theory of comparative advantage 
	 Truth, however, in Samuelsons reply refers to the fact that Ricardos 
theory is mathematically correct, not empirically valid 
	 Goal of CD (2012a) is to develop and implement a test of Ricardos ideas 
A Key Empirical Challenge 
	 Suppose that dierent factors of production specialize in dierent eco
nomic activities based on their relative productivity dierences

          <text>Computation 
	 Computation of it and pit is non-trivial in high dimensional settings like 
those we consider. 
	 For example, median county has F = 26 and K = 8. 
	 Hence, (K)F = 3  1023 fully specialized allocations to consider just 
to construct kinks of PPF.

	 To overcome identication problem highlighted by Deardor (1984) and 
Heckman and Honore (1990), CD (2012a) follow two-step approach: 
1. We use the GAEZ data to predict the amount of output (Qg
c) that 
gccountry c should produce in crop g according to (1) and (2) 
2. We regress observed output ( QQ
 Like in HOV literature, they consider test of Ricardos theory of compar) on predicted output (Qgc) 
ative advantage to be a success if: 
	 The slope coecient in this regression is close to unity 
	 The coecient is precisely estimated 
	 The regression t is good 
	 Compared to HOV literature, CD (2012a) estimate regressions in logs: 
	 Core of theory lies in how relative productivity predict relative quan
tities 
	 Absolute levels of output o because more uses of land than 17 crops

1 Law of Comparative Advantage 
1.1 Basic Idea 
	 In Lecture 1 we used a revealed preference argument to establish the ex
istence of gains from trade 
	 We now demonstrate how the same argument can be used to make positive 
predictions about the pattern of trade 
	 Principle of comparative advantage: 
Comparative advantagemeaning dierences in relative autarky prices 
is the basis for trade 
	 Why? If two countries have the same autarky prices, then after opening 
up to trade, the autarky prices remain equilibrium prices. So there will 
be no trade.... 
	 The law of comparative advantage (in words): 
Countries tend to export goods in which they have a CA, i.e. lower relative 
autarky prices compared to other countries 
1.2 Dixit-Norman-Deardor (1980) 
    n Let tn yn cnh, , ycnh denote net exports in country n1 1 G G
an n	 Let uand udenote the utility level of the representative household in 
country n under autarky and free trade 
an	 Let pdenote the vector of autarky prices in country n 
	 Without loss of generality, normalize prices such that:

          <text>2.1 Bernhofen and Brown (JPE, 2004) 
	 Bernhofen and Brown (JPE, 2004) exploit the (nearly) closed economy 
of Japan in 1858, and its subsequent opening up to trade in 1859, as a 
natural experiment to test for Law of CA. 
a	 Rare example of a closed economy, so pis (almost) observed. This 
overcomes Problem 3. 
	 Further attractive features of this setting: 
	 Relatively simple economy 
	 Subsequent opening up was plausibly exogenous to economic change 
in Japan (non-autarky was forced upon Japan by USA). 
2.2 Japan Opening Up 
2.2.1 Empirical Methodology

	 Measure gains (to a representative Japan consumer) of Japans opening 
up in 1858 
	 Consider Slutsky compensation to consumers in (autarkic) 1858: 
a f a aW = e(p )  e(p1858, c 1858 1858, c 1858) 
f	 Here, c1858 is the counterfactual consumption of Japan in 1858 if it were 
open to trade. 
f 	 Of course, by WARP, c was not aordable in 1858 or else it would 1858 
have been chosen. 
	 W measures the amount of income that would have made counter-
ffactual c aordable.1858 
3.1.1 Towards an Observable Expression 
	 Rearrange this to get something observable (let y be output): 
a f a aW = e(p )  e(p1858, c 1858 1858, c 1858) 
a f a a = p  p1858.c1858 1858.c1858

a p1858.t1858 
	 Here, the last line follows from prot maximization. 
	 Note that t1858 is counterfactual too. (1858 was autarky!) 
	 Under the assumption that t1858 = t1859, the DDN CA statistic puts an 
aupper-bound on GT. Not super surprising: p1858.t1858  0 because of GT

          <text>3.4.2 Feyrer (2009) Paper 2 
	 IV coecient in Feyrer (2009) Paper 1 is still large. 
	 Perhaps, therefore, omitted variable bias was not as big an issue as previ
ously thought. 
	 But a fundamental question of interpretation remains: 
	 Is openness capturing channels related purely to the trade of goods, 
or is it possible that this variable is (also) proxying for other elements 
of international interaction (FDI, migration, knowledge ows) made 
cheaper by the rise of air travel? 
	 Feyrer (2009) Paper 2 exploits the closing and re-opening of the Suez 
Canal between 1967 and 1975 to dig deeper: 
	 (Unstated) logic: No one is doing FDI or migration by sea during 
this period, so only thing a change in sea distance can aect is trade. 
	 Short-run shock. 
	 Can trace the timing of the impact. 
	 Very nice feature that it turns o and on: Should expect symmetric 
results from static trade models, but asymmetric results if driven 
purely by (eg) spread of knowledge.

          <text>2 	 Recall from Lecture 1: 
	 Proposition 4 In a neoclassical trade model, if there is a representative 
ahousehold in country n, then cor (p  p , tn)  0 
Testing for Comparative Advantage 
	 Principle of CA is a fundamental theoretical idea in Economics, yet testing 
it is hard. Why? 
	 Problem 1: Principle version is too weak to test in real world (where 
more then 2 countries or goods). 
	 Problem 2: Latent variable problem: Law version is statement 
about trading behavior but is based on autarky prices! 
	 Problem 3: Periods of autarky rarely observed. 
	 How to proceed? Two routes: 
1. Put a small amount of structure on the problem, as in Proposition 
4. Avoids Problem 1. Downside: Problems 2 and 3 remain, and test 
lacks power. We will discuss this approach next. 
2. Put a large amount of structure on the problem: model determinants 
of autarky prices and substitute this model in. This is hard to do, 
but can in principal avoid Problems 1-3. Downside: tests become 
joint test of CA and structure. Much of the rest of this course can 
be thought of as attempts to do this. 
	 Recall Proposition 4: 
a	 If pis the vector of prices that prevail in an economy under autarky, 
	 And t is the vector of net exports by this same economy in any 
trading equilibrium, 
a	 Then p .t  0. 
	 Comments from empirical perspective: 
a	 It is impossible to observe pand t at the same time (ie Problem 2 
can never be overcome). 
	 This is a very weak prediction. (Compare with coin toss model.) 
a	 But remarkably, p(if you observe it) is a sucient statistic for all of 
the supply and demand features of the economy. (Chetty 2009 ARE 
discusses advantages of settings like this in which sucient statistics 
exist. Though here dimensions of statistics may be quite high...)

          <text>Key idea: FR instrument for a countrys trade (really, its openness) 
by using a measure of distance: how far that country is from large 
(ie rich) potential trade partners. 
3.2.1 FR (1999): First-Stage (Part I) 
	 First-stage regression has two parts. 
	 First is based on well-known gravity equation. 
	 We will have much to say about these in a few weeks. 
	 Key idea: bilateral trade ows fall with bilateral trade costs (and 
variables like bilateral distance, and whether two countries share a 
border, appear to be correlated with trade costs). 
	 Gravity equation estimated is the following (NB: this isnt really conven
tional by modern standards): 
Xij + Mijln( ) = a0 + a1 ln Dij + a2Ni + a3Nj + a4Bij + eijGDP i 
	 Where (Xij + Mij ) is exports plus imports between country i and j, Dij 
is distance, N is population and Bij is a shared border dummy. FR 
(1999) also control for each countrys area, landlocked status, as well as 
interactions between these variables and Bij .

	 Now FR (1999) aggregate the previously estimated gravity regression over 
all of country is imports from all of its bilateral partners, j: 
aaX ijTTi = e
ii=j 
	 This constructed variable TTi is then used as an instrument for how much 
a country is actually trading (which they, somewhat confusingly, denote 
by Ti). 
	 That is, the real rst-stage regression is to regress Ti (exports plus imports 
over GDP) on TTi and population and area.

	 Now, nally, FR (1999) run the regression of interestDoes trade cause 
growth?: 
Yiln = a + bTi + c1Ni + c2Ai + uiNi 
	 Here, Yi is GDP per capita and Ai is area.Ni 
	 FR run this regression using both OLS and IV.

T on a constant and t yields a

As described in subsection A 
however, the component of the 
share that is correlated 
more constant, log population, and log area yields 
negative and significant coefficients on both 
size measures and an R2 of 0.45. 
Thus in examining whether geographic variables 
provide useful information about intemational trade, 
we need to ask whether they provide infonnation 
beyond that contained in country size. Columns (2) 
and (3) of Table 2 therefore compare a regression of 
the actual trade share on a constant and the two size 
measures with a regression that also includes our 
constructed trade share. As expected, size has a neg- 
ative effect on trade. Area is highly significant, while 
population is moderately so. The coefficient on the 
constiucted trade share falls by slighdy more than 
half when the size controls are added. 
The important message of columns (2) and (3), controlling for the size measures. The figure 
shows that although the relationship is not as 
strong as the simple relationship shown in 
Figure 1, it is still positive. The figure also shows 
that there are two large outliers in the relationship: 
Luxembourg, which has an extremely high fitted 
trade share given its size, and Singapore, which 
has an extremely high actual trade share given its 
size. Figure 2, Panel B, therefore shows the scat- 
terplot with these two observations omitted. Again 
there is a definite positive relationship.12 
12 When these two observations are dropped from the 
regression in column (3) of Table 2, the coefficient on the 
constructed trade share rises to 0.69, but the t-statistic falls (1) (2) (3)

          <text>Lots of work used micro-data and trade liberalization episodes to go be
yond the cross-country comparisons in FR (1999): 
	 Do individual rms (or industries) become more productive when 
they open to trade? 
	 Hallak, Levinsohn and Dumas (2004) argue the case for micro-studies. 
	 Eg: Treer (2004), Pavcnik (2002), Tybout (various years). 
	 We will review this literature later in the course. 
	 But note that were drifting away from theoretical arguments estab
lishing GT in a neoclassical world 
	 In two recent papers, James Feyrer has revamped interest in the cross-
country approach by using panel data and an IV based on a time-varying 
component of distance. 
	 Feyrer (2009) Paper 1: Trade and IncomeExploiting Time Series 
in Geography 
	 Feyrer (2009) Paper 2: Distance, Trade, and IncomeThe 1967 to 
1975 Closing of the Suez Canal as a Natural Experiment 
3.4.1 Feyrer (2009) Paper 1 
	 Uses panel of country-level GDP and trade data from 1960-1995 
	 Exploits fact that marginal cost of shipping via air fell faster over this 
period than marginal cost of shipping via sea. 
	 This will make trade costs (or distance) fall over time. And importantly, 
trade costs between country pairs will be aected very dierently by this: 
	 Germany-Japan sea distance is 12,000 miles, but only 5,000 air miles. 
(Treatment) 
	 Germany-USA sea and air distances are basically the same. (Con
trol) 
	 Feyrer uses this variation to get a time-varying instrument for trade open
ness, and then pursues a FR 1999 approach.

          <text>Openness is proxying for lots of true treatment eects of proximity 
to neighbors: multinational rms, technology transfer, knowledge

	 The dynamic eects of openness accumulated over a long period of 
time, are larger than the static one-o eects of opening up to trade. 
	 Eects are many orders of magnitude higher than BB 2005 results. But 
not clear how to compare them: 
	 BB focus on consumption/welfare. FR focus on production. 
	 We would expect measured GDP to fall in Japan between 1858 and 
1859 (Why?) 
	 Its very surprising that the IV coecients are larger than the OLS coef
cients. Possible explanations: 
	 Weak instrument. (But the F-stat on the rst stage is reasonably 
high.) 
	 OLS is not biased after all. 
	 Sampling variation: OLS and IV coecients not statistically distin
guishable from one another. 
	 Measurement error. (Trade is an [imperfect] proxy for the many 
ways in which interactions between countries raise incomespecialization, 
spread of ideas, and so on.) 
	 Heterogeneous treatment eectsIV only gets at the LATE, which 
might be high. 
3.4 Follow-on Work from FR (1999) 
	 Because of importance of question, and surprising ndings, FR (1999) 
generated a lot of controversy and follow-on work. 
	 Rodrik and Rodriguez (2000) were most critical. 
	 Fundamental message (that has now also been conrmed for many cross-
country studies, in all elds) is that these regressions are not that robust. 
	 Inclusion of various controls can change the results a great deal. 
	 Dierent measures of openness yield quite dierent results. 
 RR (2000) also critical of the identication assumption behind FR (1999)s

	 A partial list often mentioned in the literature: 
	 Selection of more productive domestic rms 
	 New goods available (for consumption and production) 
	 Pro-competitive eects of openness to trade. 
	 Dynamic eects of openness to trade (typically dened as some
thing, like innovation or learning, that moves the PPF). 
	 Institutional change driven by openness to trade. 
	 Some more pedestrian answers: 
	 A few percentage points of GDP is nothing to spit at (small relative 
to what?) 
	 GT depend on how much you trade (and Japan may trade much 
more in the future than in 1859)

recent decades). 
	 FR (1999) takes a huge question (Does trade cause growth?) and answers 
it with more attention to the endogenous nature of trade than previous

Class notes on 2/6/20131
1 Standard Assumptions of International Trade
The theory of international trade can be thought of as applied general equilib-
rium theory. What distinguishes trade theory from abstract general-equilibrium
analysis is the existence of a hierarchical market structure, i.e. the "Interna-
tional" goods markets, and the "domestic" factor markets.
In most of the trade models, "goods" and "factors" are distinguished in the
following sense:
Goods enter consumersutility functions directly, are elastically supplied and
demanded, and can be freely traded internationally (mobile). Factors only aect
utility through the income they generate, they are in xed supply domestically,
and they cannot be traded at all (imobile).
For example, in the Heckscher-Ohlin model we will see in a couple of weeks,
it is the dierence in factor endowments across countries that is considered as
sources of comparative advantage. In trade models, we consider the trade of
goods, not factors.
The central issues in international trade are: 1. How does the intergration
of good markets aect good prices? 2. How do changes in good prices, in turn,
aect factor prices, factor allocation, production, and welfare?
Trade models usually emphasize the supply side, and are silent on demand
side. That is, trade  ows are driven by productivity dierences (Ricardo), fac-
tor endowments (Heckscher-Ohlin), increasing returns (Krugman, 1979) or rm
heterogeneity (Melitz, 2003), but are not due to dierentiated tastes for con-
sumption goods across countries. Therefore, we will often assume that: con-
sumers have identical homothetic preferences in each country (the existence of
representative agent). Also, most of the trade models are static and only con-
sider the long-run view, hence what exactly the time the model applies is not
necessarily clear. By contrast, international macro usually focuses on dynamic
models.
These basic assumptions look very strong, but they can be dealt with by
clever reinterpretations of the model. For instance, transport costs could be
handled by interpreting one of the good as transportation services. Factor mo-
bility could be dealt with by dening as a good anything that can be traded.
Goods and factors can be distinguished by locations, time, and states of nature.
If you have already taken the international macro class (14.582), you should
recall how we dealt with intertemporal trade problems by considering the same
goods produced at dierent time as dierentiated goods.

          <text>3 Research work that has been done 
3.1 Olley and Pakes (Ecta, 1996) 
	 Drop the rm subscript i (but everything below is at the rm level). 
	 Let xt be variable inputs that can be adjusted freely, and let kt be capital 
which takes a period to adjust and is costly to do so (usual convex costs). 
	 So output is: yt = 0 + xt + kkt + t + t,w h e r e t is TFP that 
the rm knows and t is the TFP that the rm does not know. (The 
econometrician knows neither.) Both are Markov random variables (which 
is not innocuous actually, since we are trying to estimate TFP in order to 
relate it to trade policy; is trade policy Markovian?) 
	 Ericsson and Pakes (1995) show that: 
	 It is a Markov Perfect Equilibrium for rms to exit unless t exceeds 
some cuto t(kt). 
	 Investment behaves as: it = it(t,kt), where it(.) is strictly increas
ing in both arguments. 
	 First step: estimate . 
	 Estimating  (the coecient on variable inputs) is easier since were as
suming that any rm in the sample in year t woke up in t, observed its 
t, and chose exactly as many variable inputs xt as it wanted. 
	 Invert it = it(t,kt): t = t(it,kt). Note that we have no idea what 
the function (.) looks like. 
	 Then we have yt = xt +t(kt,it)+t,w h e r e t(kt,it)  0 +kkt + 
t(kt,it). 
	 Estimate this function yt and control for (.) non-parametrically. 
	 This is typically done with a series/polynomial estimator: some 
high-order (Pavcnik uses 3rd-order) polynomial in kt and it. 
	 With t(.) controlled for, the coecient on xt is just . 
	 Second step: estimate k. 
	 This is more complicated, as the rm makes an investment decision it in 
year t that is forward-looking, and this decision determines kt+1.T h e 
rms know more about t+1 than we do, so we need to worry about this. 
	 Let the rms expectation about t+1 be: E[t+1|t,kt]= g(t)0. 
We have no idea what g(.) is, but it should be strictly upward-sloping. 
	 Note that g(t)= g(t(it,kt)) = g(t  kkt). We already have 
estimates of t from Step 1 so think of t as observed.

2.2 Exporters are Dierent 
	 The most inuential ndings about exporting and intra-industry hetero
geneity have been related to: 
	 Exporters being larger. 
	 Exporters being more productive. 
	 But there are other exporter premia too.

          <text>y is any outcome variable. Employment and output per worker are 
the two main outcomes of interest. 
US	 y is the same outcome variable but for industries in the US. This 
is meant to act as a control, but it needs an IV. 
	 b is business conditions: measures based on GDP and real exchange 
rates. 
	 Treer (2004) also looks at plant-level data. 
	 A caveat is that the paper focuses on plants that have good data, 
which is relatively large plants only. 
	 Another caveat is that the above approach requires units of analysis 
to be observed in 1980, 1986, 1988 and 1996. So any exiting or newly 
entering rms are not part of the analysis. 
	 To do this Treer (2004) runs exactly the same regression as above on 
plants within industries, rather than on industries. Note however that the 
treatment variable CA does not dier across plants. it 
	 This is attractive here, as it means we can directly compare the 
tari coecient in the industry regression with that in the plant-level 
regressionif these coecients dier, this is suggestive of reallocation 
eects across plants generating aggregate industry-level losses/gains. 
	 Treer and Lileeva (QJE 2009), which we will discuss later in the 
course, does construct rm-specic taris by using taris on each of 
the products (6-digit industries) that each rm produces.

 Produce more products: BJRS (2007) and Bernard, Redding and 
Schott (2009) 
 Higher Wages: Frias, Kaplan and Verhoogen (2009) using employer-
employee linked data from Mexico (ie, when a given worker moves 
from a purely domestic rm to an exporting rm, his/her wage rises).

Class notes on 3/19/20131 
1 Introduction 
	 Hallak and Levinsohn (2005): Countries dont trade. Firms trade. 
	 Since around 1990, trade economists have increasingly used data from 
individual rms in order to better understand: 
	 Why countries trade. 
	 The mechanisms of adjustment to trade liberalization: mark-ups, 
entry, exit, productivity changes, factor price changes. 
	 How important trade liberalization is for economic welfare. 
	 Who are the winners and losers of trade liberalization (across rms)? 
	 This has been an extremely inuential development for the eld. These are 
all new and interesting questions that a rm-level approach has enabled 
access to. 
2 Stylized Facts about Trade at the Firm-Level 
	 Exporting is extremely rare. 
	 Exporters are dierent: 
	 They are larger. 
	 They are more productive. 
	 They use factors dierently. 
	 They pay higher wages. 
	 We will go through some of these ndings rst. 
2.1 Exporting is Rare 
	 Two papers provide a clear characterization of just how rare exporting 
activity is among rms: 
	 Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (JEP, 2007) on US manufacturing. 
1The notes are based on lecture slides with inclusion of important insights emphasized 
during the class.

          <text>3.4.1 Empirical Approach 
	 Dene the policy treatment variables: 
	 Let  CA be the FTA-mandated Canadian tari on US imports in it 
industry i and year t. This is the gap between the solid and dotted 
lines in the previous gure (top panel), i.e. the dierence between 
the tari on US imports relative to ROW imports. 
	 Let US be the US equivalent. it 
	 Treer estimates the following di-in-di regression: 
 + CA(CA   CA)+ US(US  US(yi1  yi0)=	 )i1 i0 i1 i0 
US US+ (y  y )+ (bi1  bi0)+ i i1 i0 
	 Treer estimates the following di-in-di regression: 
 + CA(CA   CA)+ US(US  US(yi1  yi0)=	 )i1 i0 i1 i0 
US US+ (y  y )+ (bi1  bi0)+ i i1 i0 
	 Notation: 
	 X is is dened as the annualized log growth of a variable Xio v e r 
all years in period s. 
	 There are two periods s: that before the FTA (1980-1986, s =0 ) , 
and that after the FTA (1988-1996, s =1 ) .

          <text>2.6.2 Within- and Between-Firm Eects 
	 This is where the bulk of work has been done. 
	 Indeed, the nding of signicant aggregate productivity gains from between-
rm reallocations was an important impetus for work on heterogeneous 
rm models in trade. 
	 The nding that reallocations of factors (and market share) from 
low-B it to high-B it rms can be empirically signicant was taken by 
some as evidence for another source of welfare gains from trade. 
(Though this is really just Ricardian gains from trade at work within 
an industry rather than across industries.) 
	 However, it is now better recognized that aggregate industry productivity 
is not equal to welfare and thus one needs to be careful. 
	 A stark example of this, to my mind, is Arkolakis, Costinot and 
Rodriguez-Clare (AER, 2011) who show that the Krugman (1980) 
and Melitz (2003, but with Pareto productivities added) models have 
exactly the same welfare implications. 
	 Thus, while the two models seem identical except for the fact that 
Melitzs heterogeneous rms create the scope for productivity-enhancing 
reallocation eects, other welfare eects induced by trade liberaliza
tion go in the opposite direction. 
	 We will discuss some recent and inuential papers in this area. 
2.6.3 Pavcnik (ReStud 2002) 
 Pavcnik (2003) recognized that a clear measure of dB t and each of its two Bt       
Bit dA it qitdecomposition terms i dSit and	 required a good Bt i Ait qt
 
measure of Bit.
 
	 It is hard to measure these TFP terms Bit because of: 
	 Simultaneity: Firms probably observe Bit and take actions (eg how 
much factor inputs to use) based on it. The econometrician doesnt 
observe Bit, but can infer it by comparing outputs to factor inputs 
used. But this only works if one is careful to reverse-engineer the 
rms decisions about factor input choices that were based on Bit. 
	 Selection: Firms with low Bit might drop out of the sample and thus 
not be observed to the same extent as high Bit rms. 
 Pavcnik (2002) was the rst to apply to trade liberalization Olley and 
Pakes (1996)s techniques for dealing with simultaneity and selection. 
 We discuss this briey rst before returning to the decomposition.

          <text>3.6 de Loecker (2010) 
	 One natural solution would be to work in settings where we do observe 
good rm-level price data. But this is quite hard. 
	 de Loecker (2010) proposes a more model-driven solution: 
	 He species a demand system (CES across each rms variety, plus 
rm-specic demand shifters). 
	 This leads to an estimating equation like that used in OP (1996), but 
with two complications. 
	 First, each rms demand-shifter appears on the RHS. He eectively 
instruments for these using trade reform variables (quotas, in a set
ting of Belgian textiles). 
	 Scond, Each coecient (eg k on capital) is no longer the production 
function parameter, but rather the production function parameter 
times the markup. But there is a way to correct for this after estimat
ing another coecient (that on total industry quantity demanded) 
which is the CES taste parameter (from which one can infer the 
markup). 
	 de Loecker nds that the measured productivity eects of Belgiums textile 
industry reform fall by 50% if you use his method compared to the pure 
OP (ie Pavcnik) method. 
4 Possible Ideas for Future Work 
	 On the export premium: what is so special (if anything) about goods 
crossing international borders? 
	 Can we do rm-level studies that pay attention to and estimate GE eects? 
	 Do the exporting is rare or exporters are dierent stylized facts change 
our interpretation of existing Ricardian or HO trade studies? 
	 Can rm-level studies shed light on the importance of CA vs IRTS in 
driving trade? 
	 Estimate trade liberalizations with a stronger connection to welfare (not 
just pure productivity). 
	 Could some new empirical IO tools (to study competition, interaction, 
demand systems, entry models, multiple equilibria) improve our approach 
to trade problems at the rm-level? 
	 How does trade aect (or behave in an environment of) misallocations (a 
la Hseih and Klenow (QJE, 2009))?

          <slideno>12</slideno>
          <text>As usual with these trade liberalization episodes, there were a lot of 
other things going on at the same time. 
	 Pavcnik has plant-level panel data from 1979-1986 
	 All plants (in all years open) with more than 10 workers 
	 Unfortunately, no ability to link plants to trading behavior. 
	 Closest link is to the industry, for which we know (from other sources) 
how much trade is going on. On this basis, Pavcnik characterizes 
rms (ie four-digit industries) as import competing (imports ex
ceed 15% of domestic output), export-oriented (export over 15% of 
output) or non-tradable. 
	 One would really want to use taris at the industry level and exploit 
time variation in these (as some other studies have done).

          <text>And in more recent work, Treer and Lileeva (QJE, 2009) and de 
Loecker (Ecta, 2011) improve upon the methods used in the above 
papers and nd evidence for a treatment eect of exporting on pro
ductivity. 
2.4 Firm-level Responses to Trade Liberalization 
	 An enormous literature has used rm-level panel datasets to explore how 
rms respond to trade liberalization episodes. 
	 This has been important for policy, as well as for the development of 
theory. 
	 Interestingly, the rst available data (and the largest and most plau
sibly exogenous trade liberalization episodes) were from developing 
countries 
	 So using rm-level panel data to study trade issues has become an 
important sub-eld in Development Economics (indeed surprisingly, 
there arent that many questions that rm-level data are used to look 
at in Development other than trade issues!) 
2.5 Aggregate Industry Productivity 
	 Most of these studies have been concerned with the eects of trade liber
alization on aggregate industry productivity. 
	 Unfortunately, one often cares about much more than this. 
	 Consumers may care about some industries more than others. 
	 Within industries, consumers may care about some rms varieties 
more than others. 
	 Trade liberalization will also change the set of imported varieties, and 
this eect is obviously not counted at all in measures of an industrys 
(purely domestic) productivity. 
	 Not all inputs are fully measured, so what one observes as produc
tivity in the data (eg Y/L or TFP) is not true productivity. 
	 Relatedly, there are probably uncounted adjustment costs behind any 
liberalization episode. 
	 Data limitations have presented a full and integrated assessment of all of 
these channels. 
	 But there might be ways to make progress here. 
	 Theory can be particularly informative in shedding light on the mag
nitude of some of these eects.

          <text>2.5.1 Aggregate Industry Productivity: A Decomposition I 
	 A helpful way of thinking about the eects of trade liberalization on aggre
gate industry productivity is due to Tybout and Westbrook (1995) among 
others. 
	 Notation: 
	 Output of rm i in year t is: qit = Aitf(vit), where Ait is rm-level 
TFP and vit is a vector of inputs. 
	 Let f(vit)= (g(vit)), where the function g(.) is CRTS. Then all 
economies of scale are in (.). 
	 Let Bit = qit/g(vit) be measured productivity.
 	 And let Sit = g(vit)/ i g(vit) be the rms market share in its in
dustry, but where market shares are calculated on the basis of inputs 
used. 
d ln(q it)	 And let it = .d ln(g it) 
2.5.2 Aggregate Industry Productivity: A Decomposition II
 	 Then industry-wide average productivity (Bt = SitBit) will change i 
according to:
       	  dBt dgit qit	 Bit = (it  1) + dSit
Bt git qt Bt
i	 i ' -r - ' -r -
Scale eects Between-rm reallocation eects     dAit qit + Ait qti ' -r -
Within-rm TFP eects 
	 The literature here has looked at the extent to which each of these terms 
responds to a liberalization of trade policy. 
2.6 Trade Liberalization 
2.6.1 Scale Eects 
	 Not much work on this. 
	 But Tybout (2001, Handbook chapter) argues that since exporting plants 
are already big it is unlikely that there is a large potential for trade to 
expand underexploited scale economies. 
	 Likewise, since the bulk of production in any industry is concentrated on 
already-large rms, the scope for the scale eects term to matter in terms 
of changes is small.

          <text>Clearly there is an issue of selection versus causation here that is of fun
damental importance (for policy and for testing theory). 
	 This dicult issue has been best tackled with respect to exporting 
and productivity, and we will discuss this shortly. 
	 For now, we focus on the stylized fact that concerns the association 
between exporting and some phenomenon (like higher wages).

          <text>3.5 Subsequent Work: de Loecker (Ecta, 2011) 
	 A well-known (and probably severe) problem with measuring productivity 
is that we rarely observe output yit properly. 
	 Instead, in most settings, one sees revenues/sales rit at the plant level 
but some price measure only at the industry level: pt. 
	 Klette and Griliches (1995) show the consequences of this: 
	 What we think is a measure of rm-level TFP (eg yit/g(vit)) is re
ally a mixture of rm-level TFP, rm-level mark-ups, and rm-level 
demand-shocks. 
	 This is bad for studies of productivity. But it is worse for studies like 
Pavcnik (2002) above that want to relate economic change (like trade 
liberalization) to changes in productivity. 
	 Economic change (including trade liberalization) may change mark
ups and demand. 
	 Indeed, theory such as BEJK (2003) and Melitz and Ottaviano (ReStud, 
2008) suggests that mark-ups will change. 
	 And Tybout (2000, Handbook chapter) reviews evidence of mark-ups 
(and prot margins) changing. 
	 de Loecker and Warzynski (AER 2012) extend Halls (1988) method 
for measuring mark-ups and nds that they dier by rm trading 
status.

          <text>3.4 Treer (AER, 2004) 
	 Treer evaluates how Canadian industries and plants responded to Canadas 
trade agreement with the United States in 1989. 
	 This is a particularly clean trade liberalization (not a lot of other com
ponents of some broader liberalization package as was often the case in 
developing country episodes). 
	 Further, this is a rare example in the literature of a reciprocal trade agree
ment: 
	 Canada lowered its taris on imports from the US, so Canadian rms 
in import-competing industries face more competition. 
	 And the US lowered its taris on Canadian imports, so Canadian 
rms in export-oriented industries face lower costs of penetrating US 
markets. 
	 So this is a great experiment. Unfortunately the data arent as rich as 
Pavcniks so Treer cant look at everything hed like to.

          <text>So we have: yt+1  xt+1 = kkt+1 + g(t  kkt)+ t+1 + t+1. 
(t+1 is dened by: t+1 = t+1  E[t+1|t,kt].) 
	 The goal is to estimate k, which we can do here with non-parametric 
functions g(.) and non-linear estimation (k appears inside g(.)). 
	 However, the above procedure (in Step 2) is invalid if some rms will exit 
the sample. 
	 That is, we only observe the rms whose expectations about t+1 
exceed the continuation cut-o  (kt).t 
	 OP (1996) derive another correction for this:
 	  
	 let Pt = Pr(continuing in t+ 1 )=P r t+1 &gt;t+1(kt+1)|t+1(kt+1),t = 
pt(t,t+1(kt+1)). 	  
 And let ( t,t+1(kt+1)) = E t+1|t,t+1 &gt;t+1(kt+1)+ 0. 
1 	 So ( t,t+1(kt+1)) = (t,p (Pt,t)) = (t,Pt).t 
	 Hence we should really estimate yt+1  xt+1 = kkt+1 + (t  
kkt,Pt)+ t+1 + t+1 
	 This requires an estimate of Pt, the probability of survival. OP show 
that Pt = pt(it,kt) so we can estimate Pt from a series polynomial 
probit regression of a survival dummy on polynomials in it and kt. 
3.2 Levinsohn and Petrin (ReStud, 2003) 
	 A limitation of the OP procedure is that it requires investment to be 
non-zero (recall that it(.) is strictly increasing). 
	 In the OP model this will never happen, but in the data it does. 
	 Caballero and Engel and others have done work on models that do 
include this lumpy investment. 
	 Clearly the extent of the problem depends on the length of a period 
t in the data. 
	 Long periods can mask the lumpy nature of investment but it is 
probably still a constraint on investment that rms have to worry 
about). 
	 Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) introduce a procedure for dealing with this 
(but Pavcnik doesnt use it). 
3.3 Pavcnik (2002): Data and Setting 
	 Chiles trade liberalization: 
	 Began in 1974, nished by 1979. (Taris actually rose a bit in 1982 
and 1983 before falling again).

data on total output/sales, but not sales by destination) to shipment-
level trade datasets, but fortunately this has been achieved by the above 
authors (among others more recently).

2.3.1 Premia: Selection or Treatment Eects? 
	 Consider the exporter productivity premium, which has been found in 
many, many datasets. 
	 A key question is obviously whether these patterns in the data are driven 
by: 
	 Selection: Firms have exogenously dierent productivity levels. All 
rms have the opportunity to export, but only the more productive 
ones (on average) choose to do so. A xed cost of exporting delivers 
this in Melitz (2003), and Bertrand competition delivers this in BEJK 
(2003). 
	 Treatment: Somehow, the very act of exporting raises rm produc
tivity. Why? 
	 Intra-industry competition 
	 Exporting to a foreign market (and hence larger total market) 
allows a rm to expand and exploit economies of scale. 
	 Learning by exporting. 
	 Some exporting occurs through multinational rms, who may 
have incentives to teach their foreign aliates how to be more 
productive. 
	 Focus on core competency products (i.e. productivity rise is 
just selection eect within rm). 
	 Of course, both of these two eects could be at work. 
2.3.2 Premia: Selection or Treatment Eects? 
 An important literature has tried to distinguish between these 2 eects: 
	 Clerides, Lach and Tybout (QJE, 1997) 
	 Bernard and Jensen (JIE, 1998) 
	 The conclusion of these studies is that the eect is predominantly selection. 
	 However, as we shall see below, there is evidence from trade liberal
ization studies of rms becoming more productive after trade liber
alization.

NFCT empirics has proceeded since. 
	 Ironically however, as Gabaix (1997) (unpublished, but discussed in Davis 
and Weinstein (2003, Handbook survey of FCT)) pointed out, missing 
trade makes the impressive t of the 7cks in Figure 1 of Treer (1993) 
not that impressive after all. 
	 That is, Gabaix (1997) showed that if trade is completely missing (ie 
Fck = 0) then Treer (1993) is nding the 7cks such that 7ckVck =k cs 7ckVck. c

important size effects present when comparing

There is an additional pattern in the produc-

capital per worker, then for the four most 
capital-abundant countries, we underestimate 
the capital content of production and overesti- 
mate the labor content. The reverse is true for 
the two most labor-abundant countries.25 These

Italy (0.71), Denmark (0.62), and the United Kingdom 
(0.48). For the four most capital-abundant countries we on 
average underestimate the capital intensity of their produc- 
tion by 10 percent and overestimate their labor intensity by 
8 percent. For Denmark and the United Kingdom we over- 
estimate their capital intensity by 25 percent and underes- 
timate their labor intensity by 16 percent. In addition to the 
pattern we observe among the six countries discussed in the 
text, for the ROW (0.17), we also overestimate the capital 
content of ROW production and underestimate its labor 
content. 
	 P4&amp;T4: DFS (1980) continuum model aggregation: 
	 In a DFS-HO model with innitessimally small trade costs, coun
tries will use dierent techniques when they produce traded goods. 
However, this wont spill over onto non-traded goods. 
	 If the industrial classications in our data are really aggregates of 
more nely-dened goods (as in a continuum) then at the aggre
gated industry level it will look like countries endowments aect 
their choice of technique. 
	 To incorporate this, DW estimate ln Bc(w = cln( Kc )c)ik +ik +iT 
Lc 
T RADi + c , where T RADi is a dummy for tradable sectors. ik
DF S  	 Estimates of this are used to construct B(w) analogously to be
fore. But this correction alters both the production and absorption 
equations (since the factor content of what country c imports depends 
on the endowments of each separate exporter to c).

	 They then use the predicted imports (from this gravity equation) in 
place of actual data on imports when testing the HOV trade equation 
(ie T7). 
	 Note that this is not really an internally-consistent way of introducing 
trade costs. Trade costs also tilt relative prices (so countries want 
dierent ratios of goods), and relative factor prices (so techniques 
dier in ways that are not simply dependent on endowments).

criterion (which trades o t vs extra parameters used up in a par
ticular way), P5 is best. 
	 However, because these hypotheses aect the absorption side too, a good 
t on the production side doesnt guarantee a good t on the trade side. 
	 By all measures they consider (sign tests, regressions, missing trade 
statistic) T7 does best on the trade side.

          <text>Once weve estimated the 7ck terms (which t the HOV equations per
fectly), how do we then assess the HO model? 
1. Treer (1993) shows that there exist values of (hypothetical) data (ie 
T , BUS (w), s and V ) such that some of the 7ck terms will be nega
tive. But if the estimated 7cks are negative, this casts serious doubt 
on the notion that they are well-estimated productivity parameters. 
Reassuringly, only 10 out of 384 are negative. 
2. Further, the logic so far hasnt used the FPE part of HO. So Treer 
(1993) checks how well the estimated 7ck terms (estimated o of 
trade data) bring about conditional FPE (ie adjust observed factor 
prices, which dont satisfy FPE, so that the constructed wcks come 
closer to satisfying FPE). See Figure 1 below. 
3. Other sensible restrictions: eg, we tend to think that the US is more 
productive than most countries, so the 7ck terms should be less than 
one most of the time. Reassuringly, this is true.

	 In general, Baldwin (2009 book) has a nice discussion of this. 
	 Quantifying the relative importance of endowment vs technology dier
ences for trade and/or welfare (ie HO vs Ricardo?). Morrow (2009) ex
tends Romalis (2004) to make progress here. 
	 Empirical HO with endogenous technology? (eg Skill-biased technologi
cal change.) Traditional HO theory takes endowments as orthogonal to 
technology. 
	 Endowments are not exogenous either, of course. At the simplest level, 
accumulable factors (K and H) are likely to respond to technological dif
ferences. (A dynamic HO model.) This is interesting to look for the in 
the data, and its presence potentially biases HO tests. 
	 HO with trade costs: we know theyre big, but theyre hard to add to 
perfectly competitive trade models. 
	 Empirical HO with heterogeneous rms (and xed trade costs that induce 
selection): Bernard, Redding and Schott (ReStud, 2007) and Eaton and 
Kortum (2002) are possible frameworks for thinking about this. 
	 Testing of assignment models with HO-style features (eg Treer and Ohn
sorge (JPE, 2007), Costinot (Ecta, 2009), and Costinot and Vogel (2009)). 
	 Incorporate into HO empirics some important features of emerging facts in 
other areas of trade: much of trade is in intermediate goods, is intra-rm, 
etc. (We will see these facts in due course.) 
	 HO with factor mobility and trade costs (ie economic geography).

          <text>6.5 DWBS (1997): Final Step 
	 The above ndings suggest that the problem of the missing trade within 
Japan is primarily due to assuming that there is FPE (or identical tech
nologies) around the world, or that: BJ (wJ )Xw = srV w . 
	 So the last thing that DWBS (1997) do is to see how things look without 
this assumption. 
	 That is, they simply use BJ (wJ )Xw instead of assuming that this is 
cV wequal to s . 
	 This is like assuming that there is FPE within Japan, but not neces
sarily across countries. 
	 This (as Figure 11 shows) goes some way towards improving the t.

	 DWBS (1997) have data on absorption Dr for each region of Japan. But 
they do not have this data for other countries in the world. 
	 With this data they test two hypotheses underpinning absorption: 
1. Identical and homothetic preferences (and identical prices) around 
the world: Dc = scY w and Dr = srY w , where Y w is world net 
output (ie GDP). This performs pretty wellsee following Figures. 
2. Identical and homothetic preferences (and identical prices) within 
sJapan: Dr = sJr DJ . This performs incredibly well: rank correlations

6.4 DWBS (1997): Putting It All Together 
	 We have seen that (within Japan) the FC of production and the goods 
content of absorption both appear to t well. 
	 So we can now put these two together to see how well the FC of trade ts 
(within Japan). 
	 One might think that if both absorption and production t well, then 
trade has to t well by construction. 
	 But that is not quite true, since the above test for absorption was 
done on goods not factor content. 
	 To convert GC of absorption into FC of absorption we need to mul
tiply goods absorption by BJ (wJ ), which is implicitly assuming that 
all countries use the same B(.) matrix as Japan. (That is, we say: 
BJ (wJ )Dr = srBJ (wJ )Y w = srBJ (wJ )Xw = srV w.) 
	 Figures 9 and 10 show that there is still signicant missing trade in
side Japan (Figure 9) and that this is primarily due to the absorption 
side of the factor content of trade being o (Figure 10).

2. He explores how a number of parsimonious (as opposed to the ap
proach in Treer (1993) which was successful, butdeliberately 
anything but parsimonious!) extensions to basic HO theory can im
prove the t of the HOV equations. 
5.1 Fact 1: The Case of the Missing Trade 
cV w	 Consider a plot of HOV deviations (dened as ck  Fck  (Vck  s ))k cV wagainst predicted NFCT (ie Vck  s ): Figure 1. k 
cV w	 The vertical line is where Vck  sk = 0. 
	 The diagonal line is the zero [factor content of] trade line: Fck = 0, 
cV wor ck = (Vck  s ).k 
	 This plot helps us to visualize the failure of the HOV equations: 
	 If the sign test always passed, all observations would lie in the top-
right or bottom-left quadrants. But they dont. 
	 If the HOV equations were correct, ck = 0, so all observations would 
lie on a horizontal line. But they denitely dont. 
	 Most fundamentally, the clustering of observations along the zero 
[factor content of] trade line means that factor services trade is far 
lower than the HOV equations predict. Treer (1995) calls this the 
case of the missing trade.

	 This was considered to be a real disappointment. Maskus (1985) made a

rather a commonplace! 
4 Treer (JPE, 1993) 
	 Treer (1993) and Treer (AER, 1995) extended this work in an impor
tant direction, by dropping the assumption that technologies are the same 
across countries. 
	 Treer (1993) in particular allowed countries to have dierent tech
nologies in a very exible manner. 
	 This is not only realistic, but also allows the HO model to be reconciled 
with the clear failure of FPE in the data. 
	 The key challenge was to incorporate productivity dierences in a coher
ent, theory-driven way in which all of the attractions of the HO model 
would still hold, even though technologies dier across countries.

          <text>6.2 FC of Production: Interpretation 
	 The FC of production appears to perform very badly in the cross-country 
data. 
	 This means that Bc(wc) = BJ (wJ ). 
c	 This could arise due to non-FPE (ie w = wJ ) or non-identical tech
nologies (Bc(w J )).J ) = BJ (w
	 DWBS (1997) dont seek to test which of these is at work. 
	 They do note that the richer the country, the better the t. But that 
could either be because of similar technologies or similar endowments 
(and hence production in the same cone of diversication), or both. 
	 DWBS (1997) go on to look at the FC of production across Japanese 
regions. 
	 These t better, which is very nice. 
	 However, we have to bear in mind that BJ (wJ ) was calculated to hold 
as an identity for all of Japan. So it is representative of some average 
Japanese region by construction. And hence we should expect the t 
to improve somewhat compared to the cross-country results. 
	 We should also bear in mind that just because FPE seems to hold 
well within Japan, this doesnt necessarily show that HO-style mech
anisms made it so. Factors (and technology) could also be mobile. 
(But recall, in a strictly HO world, factors wouldnt actually want to 
move due to FPE!)

          <text>If countries are small relative to the world this approximates to: 
Y c7 /Vck ck = . c7cck Y c/V c kc
	 That is, the relative productivity parameters are just GDP per factor; 
hence Figure 1 in Treer (1993) isnt that surprising. 
6	 Davis, Weinstein, Bradford and Shimpo (AER, 
1997) 
	 DWBS (1997) were the rst to explore a dierent (from Treer (1995)) 
sort of diagnostic exercise on the HOV equations. 
	 In particular, they note that statements about the NFCT are really two 
statements about: 
c1. The FC of Production: Bc(wc)y= V c 
2. The FC of Consumption (really: Absorption, to allow for interme
diates): Bc(wc)Dc = scV w . 
	 DWBS (1997) use data on regions within Japan to test 1 and 2 separately, 
to thereby shed light on whether its the failure of 1 or 2 (if not both) that 
is generating missing trade 
6.1 DWBS (1997): Factor Content of Production 
	 DWBS (1997) have data on AJ (wJ ), the input-output table, and BJ (wJ ), 
the primary factor use matrix, for Japan as a whole. 
	 Factor market clearing implies that BJ (wJ )XJ = V J : 
	 NB: Here, Xc is gross output , not value-added. 
	 Note that this is not some sort of test of factor market clearing. 
Instead, this is an identity that must hold for the case of Japan since 
BJ (wJ ) is computed such that this is true. 
	 At least, they should be computed this way! In the BLS (1987) data, 
US )XUS = V US where BUS (wUS ) is used, it is not true that BUS (w , 
which is worrying. The reason for this is that the B(w) matrices 
come from statistical agencies who have their own denition of a 
factor (eg, how do you dene and measure capital?), which isnt 
necessarily the same denition that researchers are using to dene 
V c .

Class notes on 3/13/20131 
The (Net) Factor Content of Trade 
	 Now we consider the case of G  F . As you saw in the theory lecture, in 
this case factor market clearing conditions lead to: 
Ac(w c)T c = V c  Ac(w c)c(p c)Y c 
	 Where c(pc) is the expenditure share on each good. 
c	 If we also have free trade (p= p), identical technologies (Ac(.) = A(.)), 
identical tastes (c(.) = (.)), and factor endowments inside the FPE set 
cso FPE holds (w= w), then this simplies dramatically to the HOV 
equations: 
cV wA(w)T c = V c  s . 
1.1 Constructing the NFCT: An Aside 
	 In reality, production uses intermediates: 
	 So, say, the capital content of shoe production includes not only the 
direct use of capital in making shoes, but also the indirect use of 
capital in making all upstream inputs to shoes (like rubber). 
	 Let A(w) be the input-output matrix for commodity production. 
And let B(w) be the matrix of direct factor inputs. 
	 Then, if we assume that only nal goods are traded, (it takes some 
algebra, due to Leontief, to show that) the only change we have to 
 make is to use B(w)  B(w)(I  A(w))1 in place of A(w) above. 
	 Treer and Zhu (2010) show that the only nal goods are traded 
assumption is not innocuous and propose extensions to deal with 
trade in intermediates. 
1.2 Testing the HOV Equations 
 	 How do we test B(w)T c = V c  scV w? 
	 This is really a set of vector equations (one element per factor k). 
1The notes are based on lecture slides with inclusion of important insights emphasized 
during the class.

          <text>In particular, Leamer (1980) showed that the intuitive content of HO 
theory really says that: 
KUS KUS F US	 
B(w)kT US K   	 LUS &gt; LUS F US , where FkUS is the factor content of 
L US net exports in factor k. 
	 This says that the factor content of production has to be greater than 
the factor content of consumption. 
	 But not necessarily that the factor content of exports should exceed 
the factor content of imports, as Leontief (1953) had tested. 
3 Bowen, Leamer and Sveikauskas (1987) 
	 BLS (AER, 1987) continued the serious application of HOV theory to the 
data that Leamer (1980) started. 
	 BLS (1987), along with Maskus (1985), was the rst real test of the 
HOV equations. 
	 Some details: 
 	 BLS only observed B(w) in the US in 1967, but they applied the 
 standard HO assumption that B(w) is the same for all other countries 
in 1967 as it is in the US in 1967. 
	 BLS noted that there is one HOV equation per country and factor: 
C  F equations, so C  F tests. 
	 BLS had data on 12 factors and 27 countries 
3.1 BLS (1987): Tests 
	 cV w? 	 But how to test B(w)T c = V c  s
 They should hold with equality and most certainly do not. 
 	 Not even for the US! This should really worry us, since B(w) was 
calculated for the US, so it should (and does, more or less) predict 
output at least as an identity. 
	 BLS propose two tests: 
cV w1. Sign tests: How often is it true that sign{F c} = sign{V c  s}?k k k 
Only 61 % of the time (not that much better than a coin toss).

          <text>7 Davis and Weinstein (AER, 2001) 
	 The message from DWBS (1997) was that, when restricted to settings 
where FPE seems plausible (like within a country), HO actually performs 
pretty well. That is, the failure of FPE seems to be a rst-order problem 
for HO. 
	 So DW (2001) build on this and seek to understand the departures from 
FPE within the OECD. 
7.1 DW (2001): The Matrix 
	 The key to this exercise is getting data on Bc(wc) for all countries c in 
 their sample (not easy!) All prior studies had used one countrys B(w) 
matrix to apply to all countries. 
 	 Just taking a casual glance at these suggests that the B(w)s around 
the OECD are very dierent. So something needs to be done. 
	 One approach would be just to use the data on Bc(wc) for each 
countrybut then the production side of the HOV equations would 
hold as an identity and that wouldnt be much of a test. (It does 
shed some light on things though, as Hakura (JIE, 2001) showed.)

man (1985 book)) to HOV equations in order to estimate the mag
nitude of these RTS.

US imports vary dramatically across exporting countries (and this 
variation is correlated with exporter endowments).

	 The treatment of traded intermediates aects how you calculate the 
HOV equations properly. 
	 Also a characterization of the class of demand systems that generates 
HOV. (That is, is IHP necessary?)

          <text>5.2 Fact 2: The Endowments Paradox 
 Treer (1995) then looks at HOV deviations by country in Figure 2. 
	 Here he plots the number of times (out of 9, the total number of 
factors k) that ck &lt; 0. 
	 Because Fck is so small (Fact 1), this is mirrored almost one-for-one 
cV win Vck  s &gt; 0 (ie country c is abundant in factor k).k 
 The plot helps us to visualize another failing of the HOV equations: 
	 Poor countries appear to be abundant in all factors. 
	 This cant be true with balanced trade, and it is not true (in Treers 
sample) that poor countries run higher trade imbalances. 
	 So this must mean that there is some omitted factor that tends to 
be scarce in poor countries. 
	 A natural explanation (a la Leontie) is that some factors are not 
being measured in eective (ie productivity-equivalent) units.

appear in Figures 7 and 8. The production slope 
coefficient rises to 0.97, with an R2 of 0.997. 
The median production error falls to just 3 per- 
cent. We again achieve 86 percent correct 
matches in the sign test. The variance ratio rises 
to 19 percent. The slope coefficient is 0.43 for call for a revision of our framework. 
There is one case, however, in which a closer

ing all sectors to have identical -y's) yields results that are 
almost identical to model (P5), and so we do not report 
them. 
where all of the previous trade slopes were zero. 
Clearly, allowing country capital to labor ratios 
to affect industry coefficients is moving us dra- 
matically in the right direction. 
F. A Failure of FPE and Factor Usage in 
Nontraded Production: (P5) and (TS) 
Our next specification considers what hap- 
pens if the endowment differences are suffi- 
ciently large to leave the countries in different 
cones of production. In such a case, FPE will 
break down and nontradables will no longer be 
produced with common input coefficients 
across countries. This specification of the pro- 
duction model was preferred in our statistical 
analysis of technology in Section III. Our trade 
tests now require us to focus on the factor 
content of tradables after we have adjusted the 
HOV predictions to reflect the differences in 
factor usage in nontradables arising from the 
failure of FPE. 
This is our best model so far. Plots of pro- 
duction and trade specifications (P5) and (T5) 
appear in Figures 7 and 8. The production slope 
coefficient rises to 0.97, with an R2 of 0.997. 
The median production error falls to just 3 per- 
cent. We again achieve 86 percent correct 
matches in the sign test. The variance ratio rises 
to 19 percent. The slope coefficient is 0.43 for all factors, and 0.57 and 0.42 for capital and 
labor respectively. Again, the slopes still fall 
well short of unity. But this must be compared 
to prior work and specifications (Ti) to (T3), all 
of which had a zero slope, and (T4), which had 
a slope that is less than half as large. Under 
specification (T5), for example, a rise of one 
unit in Canadian "excess" capital would lead to 
the export of nearly 0.6 units of capital services. 
The amended HOV model is not working per- 
fectly, but given the prior results, the surprise is 
how well it does.2 
G. Corrections on ROW Technology: (T6) 
We have seen that production model (P5) 
works quite well for most countries. There are a 
few countries for which the fit of the production 
model is less satisfying. There are relatively 
large prediction errors (ca. 10 percent) for both 
factors in Canada, for capital in Denmark, and 
for labor in Italy. Given the simplicity of the 
framework, the magnitude of these effors is not 
surprising. Since we would like to preserve this 
simplicity, these errors need not immediately 
call for a revision of our framework. 
There is one case, however, in which a closer 
27 Implementing production model (P5') (i.e., not forc- 
ing all sectors to have identical -y's) yields results that are 
almost identical to model (P5), and so we do not report 
them. 
	 P7&amp;T7: Demand-side dierences due to trade costs:

          <text>This is closely related to Leontiefs preferred solution to his epony
mous paradox: The US is not labor-abundant when you just count 
workers. But if you count equivalent productivity workers across 
countries, than the US is labor-abundant. 
	 This amounts to dening factors in productivity-equivalent units: 
V  
ck  ckVck. 
	 So now factor prices also have to be in productivity-equivalent units: 
 wckw ck ck 
	 Treer assumes that the only production-side dierences across countries 
are these ck terms: 
    	 That implies that B(w ) = Bc 
c (w cc ).c c 
	 Then Treer shows that all of the traditional HO logic goes through in 
terms of V  and w rather than Vck and wck:ck ck 
  )T c c(V )w	 HOV: Fck  B(w = ckVck  sk 
  	 FPE (now conditional FPE): w = wck cc k 
4.3 Treer (1993): Methodology 
	 What can you then do with these HO predictions? The central problem is 
that unlike the B(w) matrix, the B(w ) matrix is not observable in any 
country. 
	 Fundamentally, the cks are unknown. 
	 In principle, we could estimate these using cross-country productiv
ity/output data. But Treer (1993) doesnt pursue this, for fear that 
such data isnt reliable enough. (Is this still binding nearly 20 yeas 
later?) 
	 Instead, Treer estimates the cks from the HOV equations. 
	 It turns out that this estimation is trivial since there is a (unique) set 
of ck terms that make the HOV equations hold with equality (up 
to the normalization that one countrys ck = 1 for all k; for Treer, 
this country is the US). 
	 So unrestricted country- and factor-specic productivity dierences 
can make the HOV equations t always and everywhere!

	 Treer (1995) then (extending an approach initially pursued in BLS, 1987) 
seeks alterations to the simple HO model that: 
	 Are parsimonious (ie they use up only a few parameters, unlike in 
Treer (1993)). 
	 Have estimated parameters that are economically sensible (analogous 
to considerations in Treer (1993)). 
	 Can account for Facts 1 and 2. 
	 Fit the data well (in a goodness-of-t sense): eg success on sign/rank 
tests. 
	 Fit the data best (in a likelihood or model selection sense) among 
the class of alterations tried. (But the best need not t the data 
well).

	 There are of course many things one can do with these predictions, so 
many dierent tests have been performed. 
2 Leontiefs Paradox 
	 The rst work based on the NFCT was in Leontief (1953) 
	 Circa 1953, Leontief had just computed (for the rst time), the input-
output table (ie AUS (wUS ) and BUS (wUS )) for the 1947 US economy. 
	 Leontief then argued as follows: 
	 Leontiefs table only had K and L inputs (and 2 factors was the bare 
minimum needed to test the HOV equations).
 
BUS (w
 	 He used US ) to compute the K/L ratio of US exports: F US K/L,X 
BUS (wUS )XUS = $13, 700 per worker. 
BUS (w 	 He didnt have US ) for all (or any!) countries that export 
to the US (to compute the factor content of US imports), so he 
applied the standard HO assumption that all countries have the same 
technology and face the same prices and that FPE and FPI hold: 
BUS (w B c(wUS ) = c), c.
 
BUS (w
 	 He then used US ) to compute the K/L ratio of US exports: 
F US  BUS (wUS )MUS = $18, 200 per worker. K/L,M 
 The fact that F US &gt;F US was a big surprise, as everyone assumed K/L,M K/L,X 
the US was relatively K-endowed relative to the world as a whole. 
2.1 Leamer (JPE, 1980) 
	 Leamer (1980) pointed out that Leontiefs application of HO theory, while 
intuitive, was wrong if either trade is unbalanced, or there are more than 
2 factors in the world. 
	 Either of these conditions can lead to a setting where the US exports 
both K and L serviceswhich is impossible in a balanced trade, 2
factor world. It turns out that this is exactly what the US was doing 
in 1947.

          <text>P5&amp;T5: DFS (1980) continuum model with non-FPE: 
	 Another reason for T = 0 in the regression above (other than aggrei 
gation) is the failure of FPE due to countries being in dierent cones 
of diversication. (See Helpman (JEP, 1999) for description.) 
	 In this case, this eect will spill over onto non-traded goods (since 
factor prices aect technique choice in all industries). 
	 To incorporate this, DW estimate ln Bc(wc)ik = c+ik +T ln( Kc )iLc 
T RADi + NT ln( Kc )  NTic where NTi is a dummy for noniLc ik, 
tradable sectors.

          <text>With imperfect contract enforcement (bad courts) input suppliers 
who make relationship-specic inputs will under-invest ex ante in fear 
of ex post hold-up. 
	 This harms productivity. And it is worse in industries that are 
particularly-dependent on relationship-specic inputs, and in coun
tries with bad courts. 
	 Suppose further that productivity (in country i and industry k)i s 
the simple product of the relationship-specic input intensity of the 
industry, zk, and the quality of the countrys legal system, Qi. 
	 Then we have an institutional microfoundation for each country and 
kindustrys productivity level: a = zk  Qi.i 
2.3.2 Empirical specication 
	 Based on this logic, Nunn (2007) estimates the following regression, which 
is similar to Golub and Hseih (2000)s regression 1: 
kln x = k + i + 1z kQi + 2hkHi + 3kkKi + k 
i	 i 
 x is total exports and k and i are industry and country xed eects. 
	 The inclusion of k is the same thing as taking dierences across 
countries (like the US-UK comparison that GH did) and pooling all 
of these pairwise comparisons. 
	 While the regressor of interest is zkQi, Nunn controls for Heckscher
Ohlin-style eects by including an interaction between industry-level skill-
intensity (hk) and country-level skill endowments (Hi), and similarly for 
capital. 
2.3.3 Is this regression justied by theory? 
	 Nunn appeals to Romalis (AER, 2004) which derived an expression like 
this from theory. 
	 Romalis (2004) is a Heckscher-Ohlin model with monopolistic com
petition and trade costs, so FPE is broken. 
	 One problem with that is that Romalis doesnt explicitly have tech
nology terms (like zkQi) in his regression, though Morrow (2008) 
derives a version with these included.

3.8 Counterfactual Predictions 
	 Remainder of paper does something dierent: exploring the models re
sponse to counterfactual scenarios. 
	 CDKs scenarios aim to answer: How important is (cross-industry) Ricar
dian comparative advantage for driving trade ows and gains from trade? 
	 CDK actually answer a closely related question: 
	 Suppose that, for any pair of exporters, there were no fundamental 
relative productivity dierences across industries. What would be 
the consequences of this for aggregate trade ows and welfare? 
	 More formally: 
1. Fix a reference country i0. 
2. For all other countries i = i0, assign a new fundamental productivity 
k k(zi )  Zi  zi0 . 
3. Choose	 Zi such that terms-of-trade eects on i0 are neutralized: 
(wi/wi0 )= (wi/wi0 ). 
4. Let Zi0 = 1 (normalization). 
5. Refer to all of this as removing country i0s Ricardian comparative 
advantage.

nancial depth. 
	 Chor (2009): (roughly) all of the above in one regression, plus H-O 
variables (The Determinants of Comparative Advantage). 
 Nunn and Treer (2013) survey the trade and institutions literature. 
Costinot, Donaldson and Komunjer (2012) 
	 As we have discussed in previous lecture, EK (2002) leads to closed-form 
predictions about the total volume of trade, but it remains silent about 
central Ricardian question: Who produces/exports what to whom, i.e. 
What is the pattern of trade? 
	 CDK extend EK (2002) in a number of empirically-relevant dimensions in 
order to bring the Ricardian model closer to the data: 
	 Multiple industries: 
	 Now the model says nothing about which varieties within an 
industry get traded: fundamental EK-style indeterminacy moves 
down a level. 
	 But the model does predict aggregate industry trade ows. 
	 These industry-level aggregate trade ow predictions have a very 
Ricardian feel. These predictions are the core of the paper. 
	 Also, an extension that weakens the assumption behind EK 2002s 
clever choice of within-industry productivity distribution. 
Contribution 
	 The result goes beyond the preceding Ricardian literature weve seen (eg 
MacDougall (1951), Golub and Hseih (2000), and Nunn (2007)): 
	 Provides theoretical justication for the regression being run. This 
not only relaxes the minds of the critics, but also adds clarity: it turns 
out that (according to the Ricardian model) no one was running the 
right regression before. 
	 Model helps us to discuss what might be in the error term and hence 
whether orthogonality restrictions sound plausible. 
	 Empirical approach explicitly allows (and attempts to correct) for 
Deardor (1984)s selection problem of unobserved productivities.

Endogeneity Concerns 
	 Concerns about OLS results: 
1. Measurement error in relative observed productivity levels: attenua
tion bias. 
2. Simultaneity: act of exporting raises fundamental productivity. 
3. OVB: eg endogenous protection (relative trade costs are a function 
of relative productivity) 
	 Move to IV analysis: 
	 Use 1997 R&amp;D expenditure as instrument for productivity (inverse 
producer prices). 
	 This follows Eaton and Kortum (2002), and Grith, Redding and 
van Reenen (2004).

	 Results in MacDougall (1951) and GH (2000) broadly supportive of Ri
cardian model. But problems remain: 
1. Bhagwati (1963): Ricardian theory doesnt necessarily predict rela

2. Deardor (1984):	 HO model (without FPE) would predict a rela

          <text>Leamer and Levinsohn (1995): the one-factor model is a very poor setting 
in which to study the impacts of technologies on trade ows, because the 
one-factor model is jut too simple. 
	 Put another way, we know that labors share is not always and every
where one, so why would you ignore the other factors of production? 
(Though as we shall see next week, for an interesting two-factor model 
to drive the pattern of trade we need: sectors to utilize more than 
one factor, and for these sectors to dier in their factor intensities.) 
	 One possible reply: perhaps the other factors of production are very 
tradable and labor is not. 
	 A sense that the Ricardian model is incomplete because it doesnt say 
where relative labor costs come from. 
	 Probably the fundamental inhibition: Hard to know what is the right test 
or specication to estimate without being ad-hoc: 
	 As discussed in lecture 2, generalizing the theoretical insights of a 
2-country Ricardian model to a realistic multi-country world is hard 
(and has only been done to limited success). 
	 As we will see shortly, many researchers have run regressions that 
take the intuition of a 2-country Ricardian model and translate this 
into a multi-country regression. 
	 But because these regressions didnt follow directly from any general 
Ricardian model they couldnt be considered as a true test of the 
Ricardian model. 
2 Ad-hoc tests 
2.1 Early Tests of the Ricardian Model 
	 MacDougall (1951) made use of newly available comparative productiv
ity measures (for the UK and the USA in 1937) to test the intuitive 
prediction of Ricardian (aka: comparative costs) theory: 
	 If there are 2 countries in the world (eg UK an USA) then each 
country will export those goods for which the ratio of its output per 
worker to that of the other country exceeds the ratio of its money 
wage rate to that of the other country.

          <text>A second problem with this appeal to Romalis (2004) is that the 
model is eectively a two-country model, so its not clear whether an 
expression like this holds in a multi-country (and zero trade costs) 
world. 
	 Costinot (2009) provides a justication for the regression if the human 
and physical capital terms are left out. 
k k	 Note that by assumption, a = zkQi.S o a is log supermodular and i i 
everything in Costinot (2009) applies. 
2.3.4 Where is the data on zk and Qi? 
k	 z (industry-level relationship-specic input intensity): 
	 Nunn follows Rajan and Zingales (AER, 1998) and assumes that the 
US is a model technology country. So data from the US can shed 
light on the innate nature of the technology of making good k,w h i c h 
works (by assumption) in all countries.
 k kRk	 Nunn uses z = , where the sum is over all upstream j	 j neither 
supplying industries j to industry k 
	 k is the share of industry ks total input choices sourced from in-j 
dustry j (according to US 1997 Input-Ouptut Table) 
	 Rk is a classication done by Rauch (1999) of whether good k isneither 
a good that is neither sold on an organized exchange nor reference 
priced in industry journals (ie it is more likely to be relationship-
specic.) 
	 Qi (country-level quality of legal system): 
	 Nunn uses standard measures from the World Bank (based on in
vestors perceptions of judicial predictability and enforcement of con
tracts).

	 Interpreting the results: 
	 Regression coecients are standardized, so they can be compared 
directly with one another. Hence institution-driven comparative ad
vantage appears to explain more of the world than HO CA. 
	 But the partial R2 in these regressions is very low (3 % of the non-
xed eects variation can be explained by all regressors combined).

          <text>4 	 Put loosely, this requires that, prior to this change, supply-side and 
demand/TC-driven CA were osetting one another. That is, coun
tries prefer (ceteris paribus) the goods that theyre better at produc
ing. 
	 This osetting sources of CA will mean that autarky prices are 
actually similar to realized trading equilibrium prices. 
	 The paper discusses some calibration exercises that conrm this intuition: 
	 If we restrict tastes to be homogeneous across countries (taking the 
Cobb-Douglas weights of world expenditure shares), or TCs not to 
create CA, then fewer countries lose from removing Ricardian CA. 
	 If we impose both restrictions then no countries lose from removing 
Ricardian CA. 
Rough Ideas for Future Work 
	 Can one construct a true test of the Ricardian model against other models 
(eg Heckscher-Ohlin, imperfect competition models)? 
	 Recall Harrigan 1 (2003, Handbook survey): Simple partial equilib
rium supply-and-demand models predict this relationship too. A 
truly GE prediction of Ricardian models is that a productivity ad
vantage in one sector can actually hurt export success in another 
sector. 
	 And Harrigan 2 (2003, Handbook survey): A test of a trade model 
needs to have a plausible alternative hypothesis built in which can 
be explicitly tested (and perhaps rejected). 
	 Theoretical papers on the Ricardian model that havent (to my knowledge) 
been explored empirically yet: 
	 Jones (ReStud, 1961) 
	 Costinot (Ecta, 2009) 
	 Wilson (Ecta, 1980) 
	 How correlated are tastes and technology (and trade costs...and even factor 
endowments) in the world we inhabit, and how does this feature of reality 
shape the gains from trade (due to CA) that countries can possibly enjoy?

          <text>So there is lots more to do
  on explaining export specialization! (Or 
the specication was wrong and/or there is big time measurement 
error.) 
	 Nunn (2007) pursues a number of nice extensions: 
	 Worry about endogeneity of Qi so IV for it with legal origin (La 
Porta et al, 1997/1998). 
	 Propensity score matching: restrict attention to British and French 
legal origin countries only. Then do matching on them (to control 
non-parametrically for observed confounders...but note that match
ing never helps to obviate concerns about omitted variable bias due 
to unobserved confounders). 
2.3.6 Similar Ricardian-style Exercises 
	 
A number of other papers pursue similar empirical set-ups to that in Nunn 
(2007): 
	 Cunat-Melitz: industry-level volatility  country-level labor market 
institutions. 
	 Costinot (JIE, 2009): industry-level job complexity  country-level 
human capital. 
	 Levchenko (ReStud, 2007): industry-level complexity  country-level 
contracting institutions.

In the second stage standardized beta coefficients are reported, with robust standard errors in brackets. The dependent variable is the natural log of exports in industry i by
country c to all other countries. In the first stage I report regular coefficients, with robust standard errors clustered at the country level reported in brackets. The dependentvariable is the judicial quality interaction z
iQc. The measure of contract intensity used is z rs1. Although all explanatory variables in the second stage are also included in the first
stage, to conserve space I do not report the first stage coefficients for these variables. The omitted legal origin category is Scandinavian. Because there are no Socialist legalorigin countries in the smaller samples of columns (3)_(5), the Socialist interaction term does not appear as an instrument in these specifications. The reported F-test is for the
null hypothesis that the coefficients for the interaction terms are jointly equal to zero, * and ** indicate significance at the 5 and 1 percent levels.iOLS (1) IV (2) OLS (3) IV (4) OLS (5) IV (6)IV Estimates Using Legal Origins as Instruments

3.2 Theoretical Predictions: 2 Types 
1. Cross-sectional predictions: 
k	 k	 How productivity (z ) aects trade ows (x ) within any given equii	 ij 
librium. 
	 These relate to previous Ricardian literature (e.g. Golub and Hsieh, 
2000). 
	 Testable in any cross-section of data. 
2. Counterfactual predictions: 
	 How productivity changes aect trade ows and welfare across equi
libria. 
	 Used to inform GE response of economy to a counterfactual scenario. 
	 Our scenario of interest: a world without cross-industry Ricardian 
trade, which we explore in order to shed light on the importance 
(eg for welfare) of Ricardian forces for trade.

          <text>3.4 An Extension 
	 A1 (Fr echet distributed technologies) is restrictive. However, consider the 
following alternative environment:
 
[(i)]
 
1. Productivites are drawn from any distribution that has a single lo
cation parameter (zk
i). 
2. Production and trade cost dierences are small: ck 
1j c ...c ck 
Ij. 
3. CES parameters are identical: k
j = . 
	 In this environment, Theorems 3 and 5 hold approximately. 
	 Furthermore: Fr echet is the only such distribution in which Theorems 
3 and 5 hold exactly, and in which the CES parameter can vary across 
countries and industries. 
3.5 Data: Productivity 
	 Well-known challenge of nding productivity data that is comparable 
across countries and industries 
	 Problem lies in converting nominal revenues into measures of physical 
output. 
	 Need internationally comparable producer price deators, across coun
tries and sectors (Bernard and Jones, 2001). 
	 We use what we see to be the best available data for this purpose: 
	 International Comparisions of Output and Productivity (ICOP) In
dustry Database from GGDC (Groningen). 
	 ICOP data: 
	 Single cross-section in 1997. 
	 Data are available from 1970-2007, but only t for our purposes in 
1997, the one year in which they collected comparable producer price 
data. 
	 Careful attention to matching producer prices in thousands of prod
uct lines. 
	 21 OECD countries: 17 Europe plus Japan, Korea, USA.

          <text>3. Harrigan (2003): Simple partial equilibrium supply-and-demand mod
els predict this relationship too. A truly GE prediction of Ricardian 
models is that a productivity advantage in one sector can actually 
hurt export success in another sector, but GH do not investigate this 
prediction [and nor has anyone since.] 
4. Harrigan (2003): A test of a trade model needs to have a plausible 
alternative hypothesis built in which can be explicitly tested (and 
perhaps rejected). 
	 Subsequent work (which we will discuss shortly) has tackled Problem 1, 
but not Problems 2-4. 
2.3 Nunn (2007) 
	 Open question in Ricardian model: where do labor cost (ie productivity) 
dierences come from? 
	 Relatedly, in an empirical setting: are we prepared to assume that 
productivity dierences are exogenous with respect to trade ows? 
	 Nunn (2007) took an innovative take on this problem. 
	 (But this paper does not try to tackle the fundamental Problems 
1-4 of Ricardian model-based empirical work highlighted above.) 
	 Nunn (2007) is an inuential paper in the Trade and Institutions liter
ature (really: How Institutions  Trade; a separate literature considers 
the reverse). 
	 As we saw in the previous lecture, this literature argues that institu
tional dierences across countries do not just have aggregate produc
tivity consequences (as in AJR 2001), but may also have dierential 
productivity dierences across industries within countries (industries 
may dier in their institutional intensity). 
	 If that is true, institutional dierences should generate scope for com
parative advantage, and hence trade.

	 So they run this regression separately for each year, restricting the 
coecients  and  to be the same across each years regression. 
	 They also apply a SUR technique to improve eciency.

	 One is in Dollars per hour and the other is in Sterling per hour. 
	 Market exchange rates are likely to be misleading (failure of PPP in 
short-run). 
	 So PPP exchange rates are used instead. This is where international 
agencies collect price data for supposedly identical products (eg Big 
Macs) across countries and use these price observations to try to get 
things in real units (eg Big Macs per hour). 
	 GH use three dierent PPP measures: Unadjusted (same PPP in 
each sector) is surely wrong. ICP (the Penn World Tabless PPP) 
is better, but has problem that these are expenditure PPPs. ICOP 
PPP is probably best.

Class notes on 2/25/20131 
Testing the Ricardian Model 
	 Given that Ricardos model of trade is the rst and simplest model of 
international trade its surprising to learn that very little has been done 
to confront its predictions with the data 
	 As Deardor (1984) points out, this is actually doubly puzzling: 
	 As he puts it, a major challenge in empirical trade is to go from 
the Deardor (1980) correlation (pA.T  0) based on unobservable 
autarky prices pA to some relationship based on observables. 
A	 So the name of the game is modeling p as a function of primitives 
(technology and tastes). 
	 Doing so is trivial in a Ricardian model: relative prices are equal to 
relative labor costs, both in autarky and when trading. 
1.1 What Has Inhibited Ricardian Empirics? 
	 Complete specialization: If the model is right then there are some goods 
that a trading country doesnt make at all. 
	 Problem 1: this doesnt appear to be true in the data, at least at the 
level for which we usually have output or price data. (Though some 
frontier data sources oer exceptions.) 
	 Problem 2: if you did nd a good that a country didnt produce (as 
the theory predicts you should), you then have a latent variable 
problem: if a good isnt produced then you cant know what that 
goods relative labor cost of production is. 
	 A fear that relative labor costs, as recorded in international data, are not 
really comparable across countries. 
	 See Bernard and Jones (1996) and later comment/reply. 
	 A fear that relative labor costs are endogenous (to trade ows).

          <text>This statement is not necessarily true in a  Ricardian model with more 
than 2 countries (and even in 1937, 95% of US exports went to places 
other than the UK). But that didnt deter early testers of the Ricardian 
model. 
	 MacDougall (1951) plots relative labor productivities (US:UK) against 
relative exports to the entire world (US:UK). 
	 2  2 Ricardian intuition suggests (if were prepared to be very char
itable) that this should be upward-sloping. 
	 But note that even this simple intuition says nothing about how much 
a country will export.

	 Some countries (e.g. Japan) appear to gain from removing Ricardian CA. 
	 How is this possible? 
	 In both model and in calibration, nothing restricts CA from coming about 
as purely a supply-side (conventional Ricardian) phenomenon. 
	 Upper-tier utility functions Cobb-Douglas shares could vary by coun
try and industry (demand-driven CA). Recall that we didnt need to 
estimate these, so didnt restrict them in any way. 
	 And trade costs were unrestricted (so they can in principle vary in 
such a way as to create CA). Again, reall that these were not esti
mated and hence not restricted (a common approach is to make TCs 
a function of distance, which would not create CA). 
	 With this much generality, it is possible that when you remove a countrys 
supply-side (ie Ricardian) CA then it is actually better o.

Trade Agreements 
	 Given the strong and robust predictions made by theories of trade agree
ments (the GATT/WTO in particular) it is surprising how little empirical 
work there is on testing these theories. 
	 Recall that the key claim in a series of Bagwell and Staiger papers is that 
the key international externality that trade policies impose is the terms-of
trade externality, and further that the key principles of the GATT/WTO 
seem well designed to force member countries to internalize these exter
nalities. 
	 2 recent papers take nice steps towards lling this gap: 
1. Broda, Limao and Weinstein (AER, 2008) 
2. Bagwell and Staiger (AER, 2010) 
1.1 Broda, Limao and Weinstein (2008) 
	 With quasi-linear preferences across goods g, social welfare is given by 
(where  is producer surplus,  is consumer surplus and r is tari revenue): 
 
W = 1 + [ g(pg ) + rg (pg) + g (pg)] (1) 
g 
	 Then (as in Johnson, 1954) the optimal tari is given by the inverse (of 
the rest of the worlds) export supply elasticity: 
dp m opt g g 
g = g 	 (2)dm pg	g 
	 In Grossman and Helpman (JPE 1995)basically GH (1994) extended to 
a 2-country, strategically interacting, non-SOE worldthe prediction is 
(where z is the inverse import penetration ratio and  is the elasticity of 
import demand): 
Ig  zgGH = g +	 (3)g a +  g

          <text>Harrigan (1997): Interpretation: 
 	 The overall t (R2), including xed eects, is quite high: 0.95ish. 
 	 Leaves overall message that in tting a world-wide revenue function, tech
nology dierences are important. As we will see next lecture, this echoes 
a persistent theme in the NFCT literature, post-Treer (1993). 
 	 As theory would predict, the own-TFP eects (the bold diagonals) are 
almost always positive and statistically signicant. 
 	 As theory would predict, some cross-TFP, and cross-endowment coe
cients are negative, but the location of these negative coecients isnt 
very stable across specications (see other tables). 
1.6.7 Post-Harrigan (1997) 
	  Harrigan has room for non-FPE, but not for non-conditional FPE (in 
the language of Treer (1993, JPE)).

          <text>Here restricted means that the allocation of K is xed across sectors. 
Only L can be allocated to maximize (net) revenue/GNP. 
This is homogeneous (of degree 1) in K: RR(p1,p2,w,K)=r (p1,p2,w)K. 
Kohli (1993): Details II 
 	Kohli makes one assumption that is not in the usual RV model: relative 
stocks of industry-specic capital are constant over time. 
	  If this is true, then it is as if each industry was using a (dierent) 
amount of some public input. 
 	Kohli (1985) shows that if there is such a public input, and it is K,t h e n 
the aggregate restricted revenue function is additively separable across 
industries: 
RR(p1,p2,w,K)=R R1(p1,w,K)+ R
 2R	Note that unlike in the general case, R= 0. p pR2(p2,w,K) 
 This is what Kohli (1993)
1 2 tries to test. 
Kohli (1993): Details III 
 	To make progress, Kohli (1993) needs to assume a functional form for 
R
 	InR(.). 
  particular, he works with the Generalized Leontief production function 
(Diewert, 1971) with disembodied technological change: 
R R(p1,p2,w,K)=[b11p1 +  b22p
2 + bLLwe Lt+2b12 p1 p2  +2bpwe 1/2Lt

2L p1/2  K t 
 2 we ]Ke
 	             2RNote that the key testable restriction of the SF model is nowR= p1p2 b12 =0 . 
 	Kohli tests this using aggregate US data from 1948-1987.

          <text>We will rst discuss empirical work that pursues this approach. How
ever, to get empirical traction, this approach usually needs to assume 
that G= F. 
 	 If G&gt;F, production (and hence trade) is indeterminate. But the 
(Net) Factor Content of Trade (NFCT) is determinatethe HOV 
prediction. We will (next lecture) discuss empirical work that pursues 
this approach. 
1.5.2 Aside: How many goods and factors are there? 
	  Clearly, as we map from this model to the real world, the G Fquestion 
really hangs on our level of aggregation (every worker is dierent in some 
dimension!) 
	  And of course aggregation is really just at what level we assume 
goods/factors are perfect substitutes so that they can be trivially 
aggregated. 
	  A dierent approach is pursued by Bernstein and Weinstein (JIE, 2002), 
who examine whether G Fseems more plausible by testing the indeter
minacy of production (conditional on endowments) in a G&gt;Fworld. 
1.6 Introduction to Goods Content of Trade Tests 
 	 Now we focus on the case of G F, and ask whether the H-O models 
predictions for trade (or output) of goods nd support in the data. 
 	 Also called Rybczinski regressions. 
 	 Brief chronology: 
 	 Baldwin (1971): not quite the right test 
 	 Leamer (1984, book): rst pure test on trade ows 
	  Harrigan (JIE, 1995): same as Leamer (1984) but on output 
	  Harrigan (AER, 1997): adding technology dierences 
	  Schott (AER, 2001): multiple cones of specialization 
	  Romalis (AER, 2004) (and Morrow (2009)): actually G&gt;F,b u t 
production indeterminacy broken by trade costs (and hence lack of 
FPE).

          <text>11 Goods (10 plus non-traded goods) and 11 Factors (even!)
  
Leamer (1984): Results and Interpretation:
  
 	 Leamer (1984) stresses that point estimates shouldnt be taken too seri
ously. But that coecient signs should be, especially when theyre pre
cisely estimated. 
	  But how do we interpret the signs here? 
 	 The signs should all be equal to the signs on [A(w)]1 . But Leamer 
(1984) doesnt pursue this (I dont know why not). 
 	 HO theory says nothing (beyond 2 
1  2) about the signs we should 
expect on R(p)=[A(w)]. 
	  With one exception: Jones and Sheinkman (1977) show that for each 
good i, one coecient ik should be positive and one should be neg
ative. (Friends and Enemies). Leamer (1984) indeed nds this 
to be true (though that is of course a weak test). Harrigan (2003, 
Handbook survey) argues that this is a nice example of evidence for 
GE forces in the data. 
	  Leamer (1984) has a great discussion of how we could interpret some of 
the precisely-estimated coecients: 
	  Eg: in manufacturing, the coecient on capital is positive (which 
perhaps seems sensible). 
	  But in manufacturing, the coecient on land is negative. (Note that 
this is the sort of surprising result you could never nd in an industry
by-industry production function estimation approach.) Why? Per
haps because a country with lots of land specializes in agriculture, 
and this draws other resources out of manufacturing. However, this 
could of course just be sampling variation (ie some coecient(s) may 
be negative simply by luck). 
	  These are plausible interpretations, but there is nothing in general 
HO theory that says these need to be true. 
1.6.5 Harrigan (JIE, 1995) 
	  Harrigan (1995 and 2003) argues that the real intellectual content of HO 
theory concerns production,n o t consumption , and hence not trade at all! 
	  The addition of the IHP assumption to convert a prediction about 
production into a prediction about trade, he argues, is at best a 
distraction, and at worse very misleading (since IHP isnt likely to 
be true.)

 	 Magee (1980) collects data from testimony given in a Congressional com
mittee on the Trade Reform Act of 1973. 
 	 29 Trade associations (representing management) and 23 labor 
unions expressed whether they were for either freer trade or greater 
protection. These groups belong to industries. 
 	 Striking ndings, in favor of RV model (and against simple version of the 
S-S Theorem/HO model): 
1. K and L tend to agree on trade policy within an industry (in 19 out 
of 21 industries). 
2. Each factor is not consistent across industries.	  (Consistency is re
jected for K, but not for L). 
3. The position taken by a factor (in an industry) is correlated with the 
industrys trade balance. 
 	 Relatedly: As we shall see later in the course, lobbying models (most 
prominently: Grossman and Helpman (AER, 1994)) typically make the 
RV assumption for tractability. 
 	 Goldberg and Maggi (AER, 1999) nd empirical support for this in 
the US tari structure.

          <text>1.3 Regional Incidence of Trade Shocks 
 	 Suppose a change in trade policy aects p (one nation-wide goods price 
vector). How does this aect welfare (ie, real income, here) in dierent 
regions of a country? 
	  This has been an important topic in the eld of Trade and Develop
ment. 
 	 This is the question that Topalova (AEJ Applied, 2009) and Kovak 
(2009) propose, with respect to India and Brazil, respectively. 
 	 Porto (JIE, 2005), among others, also looks at this question. 
 	 The RV model (often implicitly) has been an inuential theoretical ap
proach within which to attack this empirical question.

          <text>1.6.2 From Production to Trade 
	  Finally, we can apply the usual trick in trade to convert predictions about 
output into predictions about trade ows: Identical and Homothetic Pref
erences (IHP). 
	  Which, when coupled with the assumption of no trade costs, implies that: 
T c  ( R  c p, V c)= (p).V (p)Y c
 	 Where (p) is the vector of consumption budget shares at prices p (com
mon to the whole world). 
 	 This can be re-written as: 
 T c(p, V c)=R (p).(V c s cV w) 
 	 Where s cis country cs share of world GDP, and V w is the world endow
ment vector. 
1.6.3 Baldwin (1971) 
 	 Theory: T c(p, V c)=R (p).(V c  scV w) 
 	 Baldwin (1971) was the rst to explore the implications of this equation 
empirically. 
 	 He could have either: 
1. Taken	  data on T c(p, V c), R(p)=[A(w)]1,a n d(  V c  scV w), to 
check this prediction exactly. As well discuss next lecture, one can 
obtain data on A(w) from input-output accounts. 
2. Or,	 regressed T c(p, V c)o nR (p)=[A(w)]1 to check whether the 
estimated coecients take the same signs/magnitudes as (V c scV w) 
3. Or, regressed T c(p, V c)o n(V c  scV w) to check whether the esti
mated coecients take the same signs/magnitudes as R(p)=[A(w)]1 
 	 Baldwin (1971) did 2. Leamer (1984) did a version of 3. 
	  Baldwin (1971) used data: 
	  From the US, for 60 industries and 9 factors (K plus 8 types of labor), 
around 1960.

          <text>That is, for some reason, even the relative techniques that countries 
use are aected by local relative endowments. 
 	 This stands in contrast to a HO model with Hicks-neutral TFP dif
ferences across countries and sectors. 
	  Ways to rationalize this: 
1. Country-industry technology dierences are not Hicks-neutral. This 
is probably true, but hasnt generated much work (in goods content 
of trade tests). 
2. Trade costs prevent any sort of FPE (ie dierent countries face dif
ferent pcs). This is also surely true (as well see in a later lecture, 
trade costs appear to be very high). Romalis (2004) introduces trade 
costs into a special sort of (essentially 2-country) HO model to make 
progress here. Morrow (2009) extends this to include technology dif
ferences. 
3. Countries are not all in the same cone of diversication (ie inside the 
conditional FPE set). Note that same cone of diversication means 
that all countries are incompletely specialized (ie all produce some of 
all goods), which sounds counterfactual. Schott (AER, 2003) builds 
on Leamer (JPE, 1987) and looks at whether Rybczinski regressions 
t better if we allow countries to be in dierent cones.

          <text>Import prices: GL model these as a multivariate autoregressive pro
cess in (lagged) import prices, foreign wages, and exchange rates. 
Once this is estimated, the residuals of the process can be interpreted 
as surprises. 
 	 Other elements of z: domestic input prices (domestic energy prices 
and domestic wages), domestic macro variables (GNP, PPI, M1 Sup
ply). All are converted into surprises through a VAR. 
	  Surprises to market (m): use same variables as above, but use aver
age market import price rather than rm is own industrys import 
price. 
GL (1989): Implementation II 
	  The result is a regression of excess returns (ritrmt) on surprises (NEWS  
in GL(1989) notation) to: 
 	 Import prices in rm is industry (PSNEWS ). 
 	 Import prices in market, on average. 
 	 Domestic input prices. 
 	 Domestic macro variables. 
 	 RV model predicts that coecient on PSNEWS is positive. Simple cali
bration suggests coecient in this model should be just above one. 
 	 If capital could instantaneously reallocate across industries in response to 
surprises (as in H-O model) then the coecient on PSNEWS would be 
zero.

          <text>Of course, that isnt to imply that enriching the IHP assumption isnt 
worth doing if the goal is to explain trade ows. 
 	 A key reason for Leamer (1984) to use trade data rather than out
put data was not just his interest in tradehe lacked comparable 
output data across countries. (Trade data has been good and plen
tiful around the world for centuries longer than any other type of 
data.) By the early 1990s, however, the OECD had started to make 
comparable output data available to researchers, so Harrigan uses 
this. 
 	 So Harrigan (1995) pursues the Leamer (1984) approach using output data 
instead of export data. 
 	 The results are similar to Leamers. 
 	 But he highlights that an overall disappointment is that the R2 is very 
low. 
 	 In other words, the production-side assumptions made in conven
tional HO theory are incapable of capturing much of the variation in 
output across countries and industries (and years). 
1.6.6 Harrigan (AER, 1997) 
	  Harrigan (1997) starts from the premise that (what is probably) the most 
egregious assumption in conventional HO theory is that of identical tech
nologies across countries. 
	  But how to build non-identical technologies into the above frame
work? 
	  That framework rested on the notion that since countries have iden
tical technologies, and face identical goods prices due to free trade, 
and FPI and FPE hold, R(.) is identical across countries. And we 
can therefore estimate R(.) using variation in V c across countries. 
 	 Harrigans solution was to add more structure to the set-up. 
 	 He assumed a particular (but exiblesuperlative, in the language 
of Diewert (1976)) functional form for the revenue function. 
Harrigan (1997): Set-up I: 
 	 Harrigan assumes a translog revenue function. 
 	 To this he adds Hicks-neutral productivity dierence in each country and 
sector: c
i .

1.1.1 Grossman and Levinsohn (1989) 
	  Testing the eect of goods price changes on factor returns: 
 	 Using wages is attractive: there is (probably) something closer to a 
spot market (at which we observe the going price) for labor than 
there is for machines. 
	  Using capital returns is also attractive: Can (with some assumptions) 
use data from stock markets, which provides high quality and high-
frequency data, as well as the usual opportunities for an event study 
approach. (We are perhaps more likely to believe this is a setting 
where prices are set by forward-looking, rational agents facing severe 
arbitrage pressures.) 
 	 In an innovative paper, GL (1989) follow the latter approach. 
GL (1989): Setup 
 	 GL (1989) draws on Pakes (1985): 
 	 Model of rm-level investment with capital adjustment costs. 
 	 Vector zit summarizes (the log of) all state variables that rm i takes 
as given at date t. 
 	 For our purposes, the key element in zit is the log price of imports in 
rm is industry (a demand curve shifter). 
 	 Assume that rm is country is a price-taker on world markets. 
 	 Pakes (1985) predicts that: 
rit  rmt = ki(zit  Et1[z (z it])  kmmt  Et1[zmt]) 
 	 Where r is (log) realized returns on shares, the ks are constants, and m 
stands for the entire market. 
 	 That is, rm i gets excess realized returns (excess means: relative to the 
market) if its zit is a surprise (relative to the overall market surprise). 
GL (1989): Implementation I 
 	 The key challenge is to construct measures of surprises: zit  Et1[zit].

the other 41 factors (whatever they are!) 
 	 Data on T c was net exports. (No role for intra-industry trade.) 
 	 Results: 
 	 Unfortunately, Baldwin (1971) actually mistook R(p)=[A(w)] in
stead of R(p)=[A(w)]1 , so the results are wrong. But Leamer 
and Bowen (1981) show that the sign pattern of the estimated co
ecients is only wrong if sign{(AA')1}= sign{A1}. AndBowe
and Sveikauskas (1992) show that the actual A matrices suggest this 
isnt likely to be true. 
 	 Results were not really testable (without reliable data on V w), but 
seemed reasonable except for one exception: the coecient on physi
cal capital was negative (and everyone thought the US was relatively 
capital abundant). 
1.6.4 Leamer (1984 book): Set-up 
Leamer (1984 book): Set-up: 
	  Leamer instead treats (V c  scV w)a s data  and regresses T c(p, V c)o n

on trade ows and factor endowments.

ately aggregating over some ner-level data in order to nd industries

capital-worker and professional worker-all worker ratios are similar within 
industries. (So industries look roughly similar along taste and technology 
dimensions.)

	  Mayda and Rodrik (2005) exploit internationally-comparable surveys (such 
as the World Values Survey) to look at how national attitudes to free trade 
dier across, and within, countries. 
 	 Findings support both HO and RV models: 
 	 HO: People in a country are more likely to oppose trade reform if they 
are relatively skilled and their country is relatively skill-endowed. 
(Recall S-S: trade reform favors scarce factors.) 
 	 RV: People in import-competing industries are more likely to oppose 
trade reform (than those in non-traded industries). 
1.2 Kohli (JIE, 1993): Introduction 
 	 Kohli (1993) pursues a dierent distinction between RV and HO. 
 	 Basic idea: 
 	 In a standard neoclassical economy, prot maximization leads to 
maximization of the total value of ouptut (or GNP). 
 	 Further, the revenue (or GNP) function summarizes all information 
about the supply-side of the economy. 
 	 The solution to revenue maximization problem should depend, in 
some way, on whether the maximization is constrained (some factor 
cannot move across sectors, ie the RV model) or unconstrained (all 
factors can move, ie the HO model). 
 	 Kohli (1993) searches for a way to isolate how constrained and un
constrained GNP functions look in general, and then tests for this. 
1.2.1 Kohli (1993) 
Kohli (1993): Details I 
 	 Kohli (1993) works with the (net) restricted GNP/revenue function (Diew
ert, 1974): 
RR(p1,p2,w,K)  max {p1y1 + p2y2 y wL:(y1,y2,L,K)  T
1 ,y2,L }
 	 Where pis the goods price (in sector 1 or 2), y is output, Land K are 
labor and capital endowments, w is the wage, and T is the feasible 
technology set.

Class notes on 3/11/20131 e
 
1 Empirical Work on the Ricardo-Viner Model 
 	 Very little empirical work on the RV model. Why? 
 	 RV model is best thought of as the short- to medium-run of the H-O 
model so youd expect an integrated, dynamic empirical treatment of 
the two models. However, most H-O empirics is done using a cross-
section, which is usually thought of as a set of countries in long-run 
equilibrium. Hence, there was never a pressing need to think about 
adjustment dynamics (ie the SF model). 
 	 There is probably also a sense that a serious treatment of these dy
namics is too complicated for aggregate data (even if aggregate panel 
data were available). 
 	 The heightened availability of rm-level panel data opens up new 
possibilities. 
 	 We will look here at papers that have identied and tested aspects of RV 
model that are unique to RV model (at least relative to H-O). 
1.1 Factor Price Responses to Goods Price Changes 
 	 The classic distinction between the RV and HO models concerns their 
implications for how factor incomes respond to trade liberalization. 
 	 That is, how do factor prices respond to changes in goods prices (the 
Stolper-Samuelson derivative: dw)?dp 
 	 In RV model, as p falls in a sector, prices of factors specic to that 
sector fall too. Factor incomes are tied to the fate of the sector in 
which they work. 
 	 In HO model, as p falls, factor incomes are governed by full GE 
conditions. Factor prices may fall or rise (or with many sectors we 
might expect them not to move much). 
 	 This distinction drives the empirical approach of a number of papers con
cerned with testing the RV vs the HO model:

1.3.1 Topalova (2009) 
	  In an innovative paper, Topalova (2009) estimates the following regression 
on Indian districts: 
ydt = d + t + Taridt + dt 
 	 Here, y is the poverty rate, and Taridt is calculated as the district 
employment-weighted average of national industry-wise taris. 
 	 India is attractive here for many reasons: 
 	 India went through an important and controversial trade liberaliza
tion in 1991 (and later in the 1990s). 
 	 There are very good, long-running surveys of poverty, for which the 
micro data is available from (roughly) 1983 onwards. 
 	 There are 400-600 districts, depending on the time period. 
 	 Topalova (2009) uses a (now standard) IV for taris: 
 	 In trade liberalization episodes, higher taris have further to fall. 
 	 So a plausible instrument for tari changes is pre-liberalization tari 
levels.

          <text>Ideally one could use rm-level panel data (which we will see lots of 
later in the course). 
	  Treer (2004 AER) does this well for Canadas liberalization (CUS
FTA), as we will see later. But focus there was on productivity 
changes, rather than factor adjustment/mobility. 
	  Muendler and Menezes-Filho (2007) exploit rich data on Brazilian 
matched employer-employee records to track workers around a trade 
liberalization episode. 
	  Adjustment to trade liberalization with proper micro-founded adjustment 
costs, estimated rigorously: 
	  Capital market adjustment frictions: Caballero-Engel (various), Bloom 
(Ecta, 2008); could potentially exploit US Census Data Center in 
Boston) 
	  Labor market adjustment frictions: McLaren and Choudhuri (AER, 
2010) on idiosyncratic location-specic utilities; Tybout et al (2009) 
on search frictions; Dix-Carneiro (2010 JMP). 
	  Further applications of the GL (1989) event-study approach to Trade ques
tions? 
1.5 Introduction to HO Empirics 
 	 The H-O model is probably the most inuential model in all of Trade. So 
how do we assess how useful a description of the real world it is? 
 	 One immediate obstacle is that the theorys predictions arent that precise. 
 	 The 2  2 model makes precise predictions, but (without putting 
more structure on the problem) not much of this generalizes to higher 
dimensional settings (Ethier (1984, Handbook chapter)). 
 	 As we have seen, this is a familiar problem from wider Comparative

1.5.1 What predictions does HO make in general cases? 
 	 Recall that assumption on the number of goods (G) and factors (F )i s 
key: 
 	 If G  F , production (and hence trade) is determinate. Hence the 
Goods Content of Trade (GCT) (or pattern of trade) is determinate.

          <text>1.6.1 H-O Theory with G F 
 	 Recall the  revenue function (for country c): Yc = rc(pc,Vc)  maxyc {p.c	yc : 
y 	 c T(Vc)}. 
	  Here Y is total GDP, y is the vector of outputs (in each sector), p is 
the vector of prices, and T is the technology set. 
	  Then we have (with G F): y c= prc(pc,Vc), which is homogeneous of 
degree one in Vc  
by CRTS. 
 	 Recall that with G&gt;F, this becomes a correspondence (ie produc
tion is indeterminate), not an equality. 
	  And hence: y c= cpV ).Vc  Rc r(pc,Vc(pc,Vc).Vc . 
	  Rc(pc,Vc) is often called the Rybczinski matrix. 
 	 The prediction y c= Rc(pc,Vc).Vc looks amenable to empirical work, at 
rst glance. 
 	 Clearly, without any structure on the technology set T,i eo nR (.,.), 
this cant go anywhere. 
 	 Some work (eg Kohli (1978, 1990)) has applied structure (eg a translog 
or generalized Leontief revenue function) and gone from there, using 
data from one country. 
	  But if you wanted to pool estimates across countries, or dont ob
serve goods price data in all countries, the equation above oers no 
guidance on how to proceed. 
 	 The more inuential Trade approach has been to further assume that 
G= F (the even case). Then: 
	  The factor market clearing conditions imply immediately that (as
suming Ac(wc,Vc) is invertible): y c=[Ac(wc,Vc)]1Vc 
 	 So Rc(pc,Vc)=[Ac(wc,Vc)]1 . 
 	 And if we conne attention to an FPE equilibrium (identical tech
nologies (ie Ac(.,.)= A(.,.)), no trade costs, no factor intensity re
versals, and endowments inside the FPE set) then factor price in
sensitivity holds: A(w,Vc)=A (w). (ie techniques used are locally 
independent of Vc.) 
 	 Similarly: Rc(pc,Vc)=R (p) that is, all countries have the same 
Rybczinski (or A) matrix.

          <text>1.3.2 Kovak (2009)
	  Kovak (2009) performs a similar exercise to Topalova (2009), but with 
some attractive extensions: 
 	 The estimating equation emerges directly from a RV model. 
 	 The estimating equation is similar to Topalova (2009), but with a 
slight alteration to the way that Taridt is calculated (he uses dier
ent weights and dierent treatment of the non-traded sector). 
	  Unlike Topalova (2009), Kovak (2009) nds economically and statis
tically signicant migration responses: people appear to move around 
the country in response to (national) tari changes, to get closer to 
favored industry-specic factors like capital/land. 
1.4 Areas for Future Research 
 	 Tracing the short-, medium- and long-run adjustment to trade liberaliza
tions or other natural experiments. 
 	 Can RV and HO models be unied in the data as the same model 
with dierent time horizons?
