	A cell has a mechanism to coordinate cycles of two 
subsystems such that the overall periodicity is 
maintained 
 Break -down of functional periodicity leads to anomaly of 
cell division and further chaotic behavior of the system

          <text>Complexity: A measure of uncertainty in achieving the desired set 
of FRs of a system
	Time- independent real complexity 
Measure of uncertainty when the probability of achieving the functional 
requirements is less than 1.0 (because the common range is not identical to the 
system range) 
 Time- independent imaginary complexity 
Uncertainty that arises because of the designer s lack of knowledge and 
understanding of a specific design itself  
	Time-dependent combinatorial complexity 
Time -dependent combinatorial complexity arises because in many situations, 
future events cannot be predicted a priori.  This type of time -dependent 
complexity will be defined as time -dependent combinatorial complexity. 
 Time-dependent periodic complexity 
Consider the problem of scheduling airline flights.  it is periodic and thus 
uncertainties created during the prior period are irrelevant .  This type of time -
dependent complexity will be defined as time -dependent periodic complexity.

Manufacturing systems consist of 
machines, materials, people, and information. 
The goal of a manufacturing system is to improve 
customer satisfaction 
through improvements in 
the quality of products, short delivery time, and 
high labor productivity. 
Manufacturing systems must be designed to 
satisfy a specific set of FRs and constraints.</text>

Solution for qs
The best solution was obtained by finding a set of values that give the s hortest cycle time  
TCsolving Eq. (6.12) repeatedly and using a genetic algorithm . The solution yields the 
following values for q's.
qA= 19.7 sec
qB= 0 sec
qC= 9.3 sec
qD= 9.3 sec
qE= 0 sec
The queues for B and E zeros since the tolerance on these two m odules is specified to be 
zero.  Therefore, the queues of other m odules has been adjusted to make these two queues 
to be zero.</text>

5. The shortcom ings of the tradit ional approach to these problem s 
such as operations research (OR) ca n be overcome by developing designs 
that satisfy the Independence Ax iom.
6. The ideas presented in this sectio n can be applied to a variety of 
system  problems that involve design, analysis, and optim ization.
7. The important message is that if the system design violates the 
Independence Axiom, it is extremely difficult to achieve the functional 
requirements of a manufacturing system.

For manufacture of random sets of different types of parts 
that require a number of different processes, a pull 
system appears to be the better than a push system.
In a "pull system", the producti on rate is gated by the rate 
at which the finished part leaves the manufacturing system.  
The "pull" system is neither inherently better nor w orse 
than a "push" system  it is si mply a matter of having to 
satisfy different sets of FRs.</text>

The manufacturing system is defined as an 
organization in the manufacturing industry for the 
creation of production. In the mechanical and electrical 
engineering industries a manufacturing system in 
general has an integrated groups of functions: They are 
the sales, design, manufacturing production, and 
shipping functions. A resear ch function may provide a 
service to one or more of the other functions.</text>

One of the interesting results of  this solution is that the 
number of combinations for pa rt flow reduces down from 
several thousands to a few,  because the parts flo w 
through the manufacturing system along deterministic 
paths.  
What the concept of decouple rshas done is to change a 
combinatorial problem into a periodic function that 
repeats itself with a given cycle that is deterministic.</text>

          <text>Elements of Manufacturing Systems
To make all these machines and people w ork together for the 
common goal of the system, 
we must deal with 
information -- generation, collection, processing, transmission, 
and interpretation of information.
Information is typically embedded in hard ware and software.  
It forms the interface between diverse elements of a 
manufacturing system, and integrates the functions of the 
system.  Without the proper management of information, a 
modern manufacturing system cannot function.</text>

          <text>What is the main message of this section?
1. When identical parts processed by identical processes, we can 
use a Push System.
2. By decoupling a coupled design, we have reduced a problem that 
used to be treated as a combinatoria l problem to a deterministic problem 
that can be solved "exactly"!  
3. The number of possible combinations w as reduced from severa l 
thousands to t wo!  The throughput rate is also controlled precisely 
because the system has been designed with a given throughput in mind.  
4. The decoupled design of a manufacturing system that processes 
identical parts can be modified without much effort.</text>

          <text>Basic Requirements of a Manufacturing System
A manufacturing system must be designed consistent with the 
design axioms to be most efficient and reliable.
In a "push" system, w e must be  sure that a decoupled system 
is created to maintain the independence of FRs.
In these machines, "decouplers" are used to create functional 
independence and satisfy various functional requirements 
while the part is subject to various processes in the 
manufacturing system.</text>

1.Know their "customers' needs".
2.Define the problem they must solve to satisfy the nee ds.
3.Conceptualize the solution through synthesis , which  involves the task 
of satisfying several different func tional requirements using a set of 
inputs such as product design parame ters within given constraints.  
4.Perform analysis to optim ize the proposed solution. 
5.Check the resulting design solution to see if it meets the original 
customer needs.</text>

Equivalent Design:
When two different designs satisfy the same set of the 
highest-level FRs but have different hierarchical 
architecture, the designs are defined to be equivalent 
designs.
Identical Design:
When two different designs satisfy the same set of 
FRs and have the identical design architecture, the 
designs are defined to be identical designs.</text>

2. Lower manufacturing cost, 
3. Improve the quality and reliability of
products, 
4. Satisfy the required functions most
effectively.
Hardware, software, and systems must be designed right to be

Functional Requirement: 
Functional requirements (FRs) are a minimum set of 
independent requirements that completely characteri ze the 
functional needs of the product (or software, organizations, 
systems, etc.) in the functional domain.  By definition, each 
FR is independent of every other FR at the time the FRs are 
established.
Constraint: 
Constraints (Cs) are bounds on acceptable solutions. There 
are two kinds of constraints: input constraints and system 
constraints.  Input constraints are imposed as part of the 
design specifications. System  constraints are constraints 
imposed by the system in which the design solution must 
function.</text>

The results show that the group is confused as to what it wants. It 
prefers A over B, and B over C, but it prefers C over A rather than A

          <text>Conclusions
Transforming a time-dependent combinatorial 
complexity into a periodic complexity increases the 
stability of the system and the system performance. 
The transformation is achieved by introducing (or 
maintaining) functional periodicity.
The periodicity is introduced by re-initiali zing subsystems 
on a periodic interval of a set of FRs.</text>

In axiomatic design, robust design is defined as a design that a lways 
satisfies the functional requirements, 
FRi&gt; FRi
even when there is a large random variation in the design parame ter DPi.
Two different concepts in robustness
Insensitive to noise 
Information Axiom
Traditional robust design 
Adaptive to change
Independence Axiom

Is it a complex task? Why? Why not?
If the flow rate has to be controlled to 1 gallon +/-
0.01 gallons/minute and the temperature within 60

The task is more complex when these two FRs are

as the complexity that only exists in a finite period,
resulting in a finite and limited number of probable 
combinations.
Example: Airline flight scheduling

day terminate at the end of a 24-hour cycle, and hence the complexity 
does not extend to the follo wing day</text>

          <text>Why complexity?
In many fields (engineering, economics, politics, academic 
administration, etc.), one of the major goals is to reduce 
complexity.
In many fields, we want to  understand the causes for 
complexity.
There is a great deal of confusion what we mean by 
complexity.
Computer scientists and mathematicians have considered 
complexity, which may not be applicable to design and 
engineering fields.

2. Identify a set of FRs that undergoes a cyclic 
change  and has a functional period.
3 Identify the functional requirement that 
may undergo a combinatorial process

          <text>3. Time-Dependent Combinatorial Complexity
The combinatorial complexity is defined as the complexity 
that increases as a function of time due to a continued 
expansion in the number of possible combinations with 
time, which may eventually lead to a chaotic state or a 
system failure. 
Example: Job shop scheduling
Future scheduling is affected by the decisions made 
earlier and its complexity is a func tion of the decisions made over its 
past history</text>

What constitute a GOOD set of FRs?
MECE: Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive
One FR carries only one requirement
Juxtaposing two requirements into one doesnt make them a 
single requirement
Solution neutral
Cover the battery contact by a plastic sliding door
Clarity/specificity
Bad example: missing target  range, time factor, etc.

Robustness
Robustness
In axiomatic des ign, robust design is  defined as a design that always 
satisfies the functional requirements, 
FRi&gt; FRi
even when there is a large random va riation in the design parameter  DPi.
Two different concepts in robustness
Insensitive to noise
Information Axiom
Traditional robust design 
Adaptive to change
Independence Axiom

Functional Requirement (FR)
Functional requirements (FRs) are a minimum set of 
independent requirements that completely characterize 
the functional needs of the artifact (product, software, 
organization, system, etc.) in the functional domain.
Independently achievable, in principle.
The determination of a good set of FRs requires skill, , 
and many iterations</text>

Two designs are defined to be 
"equivalent"
if they satisfy the same set of the highest level 
FRs within the bounds established by the same 
set of constraints, 
even though the mapping and decomposition 
process might have yielded designs that have 
substantially different lower level FRs and all 
DPs for each of these designs.</text>

Professor Billy Fredriksson
We have an interesting ongoing research on product 
development utilizing your Ax iomatic Design Theory . 
Building on your theory Gunnar Holmberg (PhD-student 
from Saab) is using AD on high sy stems architecture level to 
design systems for life cycle flex ibility. This is in order to 
efficiently add new unknown functionality through the life of 
the systems.
It would be interesting and valuable to us to discuss this with 
you. I am planning to go to US in  April and plan to be at MIT 
23 April. Would you be available at MIT?</text>

2. Spin module must not affect each other in the

3. The evidence of this X is the utili zation of

4. Standard method for wafer hand-off is required.
5. Flexible or standard way of supervising

When the complete set of the subsets of {FRs}

there is no guarantee that 
a specific design will al ways have the minimum information

The large flexible system with an infinite

-Design of a Continuous Process
To create a continuous process, we must be able 
to design a process and associated equipment 
to perform following four functions:
(1) Rapid dissolution of gas into molten, flowing 
polymer to form a solution, 
(2) Nucleation of a large number of cells, 
(3) Control of the cell size, and 
(4) Control of the geometry of the final product.</text>
