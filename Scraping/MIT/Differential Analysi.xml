for instance over the unit cube [0,1]n: 
u(f) = f(x) dx . 
[0,1]n 
In some sense we must show that all continuous linear functionals 
on C0(X) are given by integration. However, we have to interpret 
integration somewhat widely since there are also evaluation functionals. 
If zX consider the Dirac delta 
z (f) = f(z) . 
This is also called a point mass of z. So we need a theory of measure 
and integration wide enough to include both of these cases. 
One special feature of C0(X), compared to general normed spaces, is 
that there is a notion of positivity for its elements. Thus f  0 just 
means f(x) 0 xX. 
Lemma 1.4. Each f  C0(X) can be decomposed uniquely as the dif
ference of its positive and negative parts 
(1.6) f = f+ f , f  C0(X) , f(x)  |f(x)| xX . 
Proof. Simply dene 
&#13;
 
f(x) = f(x) 
0 if 
if f(x) 0 
f(x) &lt;0 
for the same sign throughout. Then (1.6) holds. Observe that f+ is 
continuous at each yX since, with U an appropriate neighborhood 
of y, in each case 
f(y) &gt;0 =f(x) &gt;0 for xU =f+ = f in U 
f(y) &lt;0 =f(x) &lt;0 for xU =f+ = 0 in U 
f(y) = 0 = given  &gt;0 U s.t. |f(x)|&lt; in U 
= |f +(x)|&lt; in U . 
Thus f = ff+  C0(X), since both f+ and f vanish at innity.  
We can similarly split elements of the dual space into positive and 
negative parts although it is a little bit more delicate. We say that 
u(C0(X)) is positive if 
(1.7)	 u(f) 0 0 f  C0(X) . 
For a general (real) u(C0(X)) and for each 0 f  C0(X) set 
(1.8) u+(f) = sup {u(g) ; g C0(X) ,0 g(x) f(x) xX}.</text>

1. Continuous functions 
A the beginning I want to remind you of things I think you already 
know and then go on to show the direction the course will be taking. 
Let me rst try to set the context. 
One basic notion I assume you are reasonably familiar with is that 
of a metric space ([5] p.9). This consists of a set, X, and a distance 
function 
d : X  X = X2  [0, ) , 
satisfying the following three axioms: 
i) d(x, y) = 0  x = y, (and d(x, y)  0) 
(1.1)	 ii) d(x, y) = d(y, x)  x, y  X 
iii) d(x, y)  d(x, z) + d(z, y)  x, y, z  X. 
The basic theory of metric spaces deals with properties of subsets 
(open, closed, compact, connected), sequences (convergent, Cauchy) 
and maps (continuous) and the relationship between these notions. 
Let me just remind you of one such result. 
Proposition 1.1. A map f : X  Y between metric spaces is con
tinuous if and only if one of the three following equivalent conditions 
holds 
(1) f1(O)  X is open  O  Y open. 
(2) f1(C)  X is closed  C  Y closed. 
(3) limn f(xn) = f(x) in Y if xn  x in X. 
The basic example of a metric space is Euclidean space. Real n-
dimensional Euclidean space, Rn, is the set of ordered n-tuples of real 
numbers 
x = (x1, . . ., x n)  Rn , xj  R , j = 1, . . ., n . 
It is also the basic example of a vector (or linear) space with the oper
ations 
x+ y = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, . . ., x n + yn) 
cx = (cx1, . . ., cx n) . 
The metric is usually taken to be given by the Euclidean metric 
n 
2 2 2| x| = (x1 +    + xn)1/2 = ( xj )1/2 , 
j=1 
in the sense that 
d(x, y) = | x y| .</text>

Let us abstract this immediately to the notion of a normed vector 
space, or normed space. This is a vector space V (over R or C) equipped 
with a norm, which is to say a function 
 : V [0, ) 
satisfying 
i) v= 0  v = 0, 
(1.2) ii) cv= |c| v c K, 
iii) v + w  v + w. 
This means that (V, d), d(v, w) = v wis a vector space; I am also 
using K to denote either R or C as is appropriate. 
The case of a nite dimensional normed space is not very interesting 
because, apart from the dimension, they are all the same. We shall 
say (in general) that two norms    1 and    2 on V are equivalent 
of there exists C &gt; 0 such that 
1 v1  v2 Cv1 v V . C 
Proposition 1.2. Any two norms on a nite dimensional vector space 
are equivalent. 
So, we are mainly interested in the innite dimensional case. I will 
start the course, in a slightly unorthodox manner, by concentrating on 
one such normed space (really one class). Let X be a metric space. 
The case of a continuous function, f : X R (or C) is a special case 
of Proposition 1.1 above. We then dene 
C(X) = {f : X R, f bounded and continuous }. 
In fact the same notation is generally used for the space of complex-
valued functions. If we want to distinguish between these two possi
bilities we can use the more pedantic notation C(X; R) and C(X; C). 
Now, the obvious norm on this linear space is the supremum (or uni
form) norm 
f = sup |f(x)|. 
xX 
Here X is an arbitrary metric space. For the moment X is sup
posed to be a physical space, something like Rn . Corresponding to 
the nite-dimensionality of Rn we often assume (or demand) that X 
is locally compact. This just means that every point has a compact 
neighborhood, i.e., is in the interior of a compact set. Whether locally</text>

This is certainly nite since u(g)  Cg  Cf. Moreover, if 
0 &lt; c  R then u+(cf) = cu+(f) by inspection. Suppose 0  fi  
C0(X) for i = 1,2. Then given  &gt; 0 there exist gi  C0(X) with 
0 gi(x) fi(x) and 
u+(fi) u(gi) +  . 
It follows that 0 g(x) f1(x) + f2(x) if g = g1 + g2 so 
u+(f1 + f2) u(g) = u(g1) + u(g2) u+(f1) + u+(f2) 2 . 
Thus 
u+(f1 + f2) u+(f1) + u+(f2). 
Conversely, if 0  g(x)  f1(x) + f2(x) set g1(x) = min(g, f 1)  
C0(X) and g2 = g g1. Then 0  gi  fi and u+(f1) + u+(f2)  
u(g1) + u(g2) = u(g). Taking the supremum over g, u+(f1 + f2)  
u+(f1) + u+(f2), so we nd 
(1.9) u+(f1 + f2) = u+(f1) + u+(f2) . 
Having shown this eective linearity on the positive functions we can 
obtain a linear functional by setting 
uf(1.10) u+(f) = u+(f+) u+(f) f  C0(X) . 
Note that (1.9) shows that u+(f) = u+(f1) u+(f2) for any decom
posiiton of f = f1 f2 with fi  C0(X), both positive. [Since f1 + f = 
2 + f+ so u+(f1) + u+(f) = u+(f2) + u+(f+).] Moreover, 
|u+(f)| max(u +(f+), u(f ))  u f  
= u +  u . 
The functional 
 = u+ u 
is also positive, since u+(f)  u(f) for all 0  f  C0(x). Thus we 
have proved 
Lemma 1.5. Any element u (C0(X)) can be decomposed, 
u = u+ u 
into the dierence of positive elements with 
u+, u  u . 
The idea behind the denition of u+ is that u itself is, more or less, 
integration against a function (even though we do not know how to 
interpret this yet). In dening u+ from u we are eectively throwing 
away the negative part of that function. The next step is to show that 
a positive functional corresponds to a measure meaning a function</text>

compact or not we can consider 
(1.3) C0(X) = f  C(X);  &gt; 0 K 
 Xs.t. sup |f(x)|   . 
x/K 
Here the notation K 
 X means K is a compact subset of X. 
If V is a normed linear space we are particularly interested in the 
continuous linear functionals on V . Here functional just means func
tion but V is allowed to be large (not like Rn) so functional is used 
for historical reasons. 
Proposition 1.3. The following are equivalent conditions on a linear 
functional u : V R on a normed space V . 
(1) u is continuous. 
(2) u is continuous at 0. 
(3) {u(f) R ; f V , f 1}is bounded. 
(4) C s.t. |u(f)| Cf f V . 
Proof. (1) = (2) by denition. Then (2) implies that u1(1, 1) is 
a neighborhood of 0  V , so for some  &gt; 0, u({f V ; f&lt; })  
1(1, 1). By linearity of u, u({f V ; f&lt; 1}) (1 
, ) is bounded, 
so (2) =(3). Then (3) implies that 
|u(f)| C f V, f 1 
for some C. Again using linearity of u, if f = 0, 
f |u(f)|  f u f Cf, 
giving (4). Finally, assuming (4), 
|u(f) u(g)|= |u(f g)| Cf g 
shows that u is continuous at any point g V .  
In view of this identication, continuous linear functionals are often 
said to be bounded. One of the important ideas that we shall exploit 
later is that of duality. In particular this suggests that it is a good 
idea to examine the totality of bounded linear functionals on V . The 
dual space is 
V  = V  = {u : V  K , linear and bounded }. 
This is also a normed linear space where the linear operations are 
(u + v)(f) = u(f) + v(f)(1.4) f V. (cu)(f ) = c(u(f))</text>

The natural norm on V  is 
u= sup |u(f )|. 
f 1 
This is just the best constant in the boundedness estimate, 
u= inf {C; |u(f )| Cf  f V }. 
One of the basic questions I wish to pursue in the rst part of the 
course is: What is the dual of C0(X) for a locally compact metric space 
X? The answer is given by Riesz representation theorem, in terms of 
(Borel) measures. 
Let me give you a vague picture of regularity of functions which 
is what this course is about, even though I have not introduced most 
of these spaces yet. Smooth functions (and small spaces) are towards 
the top. Duality ips up and down and as we shall see L2 , the space 
of Lebesgue square-integrable functions, is generally in the middle. 
What I will discuss rst is the right side of the diagramme, where we 
have the space of continuous functions on Rn which vanish at innity 
and its dual space, Mn(Rn), the space of nite Borel measures. There 
are many other spaces that you may encounter, here I only include test 
functions, Schwartz functions, Sobolev spaces and their duals; k is a 
general positive integer. 
(1.5) S(Rn)  
Hk(Rn) Cc(Rn) C0(Rn)    
L2(Rb)  
 
M (Rn)  Hk(Rn)  Mn(Rn) 
S (Rn). 
I have set the goal of understanding the dual space Mn(Rn) of C0(X), 
where X is a locally compact metric space. This will force me to go 
through the elements of measure theory and Lebesgue integration. It 
does require a little forcing! 
The basic case of interest is Rn . Then an obvious example of a con
tinuous linear functional on C0(Rn) is given by Riemann integration,</text>

/4 + 2k &lt; . 
This un u in S(Rn).	  
As well as the Schwartz space, S(Rn), of functions of rapid decrease 
with all derivatives, there is a smaller standard space of test functions, 
namely 
(6.14) C(Rn) = {u  S(Rn); supp(u) 
 Rn},c 
the space of smooth functions of compact support. Again, it is not 
quite obvious that this has any non-trivial elements, but it does as 
we shall see. If we x a compact subset of Rn and look at functions 
with support in that set, for instance the closed ball of radius R &gt; 0, 
then we get a closed subspace of S(Rn), hence a complete metric space. 
One problem with C(Rn) is that it does not have a complete metric c 
topology which restricts to this topology on the subsets. Rather we 
must use an inductive limit procedure to get a decent topology. 
Just to show that this is not really hard, I will discuss it briey 
here, but it is not used in the sequel. In particular I will not do this 
in the lectures themselves. By denition our space C(Rn) (denoted c 
traditionally as D(Rn)) is a countable union of subspaces 
(6.15) 
C(Rn) = C(B(n)), C(B(n)) = {u  S(Rn); u = 0 in |x|&gt; n}.c c c
nN
Consider 
(6.16) 
T = {U  C(Rn); U  C(B(n)) is open in C(B(n)) for each n}.c c
(Rn)
 This is a topology on C  contains the empty set and the whole c 
space and is closed under nite intersections and arbitrary unions  
 simply because the same is true for the open sets in C(B(n)) for each 
n. This is in fact the inductive limit topology. One obvious question 
is:- what does it mean for a linear functional u : C(Rn) C to be c 
continuous? This just means that u1(O) is open for each open set in C. 
Directly from the denition this in turn means that u1(O) C(B(n))</text>

Proof. That  C1 is a norm follows from the properties of  . Namely 
uC1 = 0 certainly implies u = 0, au C1 = |a| u C1 and the triangle 
inequality follows from the same inequality for  . 
1
0(Rn) follows from Similarly, the main part of the completeness of C
0
0(Rn).1
0(Rn) the completeness of C If {un} is a Cauchy sequence in C
then un and the un 
xj 0
0(Rnare Cauchy in C ). It follows that there are 
limits of these sequences, 
un 0
0(Rn) . v , vj  C un xj 
However we do have to check that v is continuously dierentiable and 
that v = vj.xj 
One way to do this is to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 
in each variable. Thus  t un un(x + tei) = (x + sei) ds + un(x) . xj 0 
As n   all terms converge and so, by the continuity of the integral, 
 t 
u(x + tei) = vj(x + sei) ds + u(x) . 
0 
This shows that the limit in (6.6) exists, so vi(x) is the partial deriva
tion of u with respect to xi. It remains only to show that u is indeed 
dierentiable at each point and I leave this to you in Problem 17. 
So, almost by denition, we have an example of Lemma 6.1, 
1
0(Rn)  C0
0(Rn). C
It is in fact dense but I will not bother showing this (yet). So we know 
that 
0
0(Rn)) (C1
0(Rn))(C
and we expect it to be injective. Thus there are more functionals on
1
0(Rn) including things that are more singular than measures. 
An example is related to the Dirac delta 
0
0(Rn) , (x)(u) = u(x) , u  C
namely 
u (Rn) u 1

This is clearly a continuous linear functional which it is only just to 
denote  (x).xj

It is not immediately apparent that this space is non-empty (well 0 
is in there but...); that 
2exp( |x| )  S(Rn) 
is Problem 19. There are lots of other functions in there as we shall 
see. 
Schwartz idea is that the dual of S(Rn) should contain all the in
teresting objects, at least those of polynomial growth. The problem 
is that we do not have a good norm on S(Rn). Rather we have a lot of 
them. Observe that 
l kkx lC0 (Rn)  x C0 (Rn) if l l and k k . 
Thus we see that as a linear space 
k(6.10)	 S(Rn) = x kC0 (Rn). 
k 
Since these spaces are getting smaller, we have a countably innite 
number of norms. For this reason S(Rn) is called a countably normed 
space. 
Proposition 6.7. For u  S(Rn), set 
(6.11)	 u(k) = x k uCk 
and dene 
(6.12) d(u, v) =  
2k u v(k) ,1 + u v(k)k=0 
then d is a distance function in S(Rn) with respect to which it is a 
complete metric space. 
Proof. The series in (6.12) certainly converges, since 
u v(k) 1. 1 + u v(k) 
The rst two conditions on a metric are clear, 
d(u, v) = 0  u vC0 = 0 u = v, 
and symmetry is immediate. The triangle inequality is perhaps more 
mysterious! 
Certainly it is enough to show that 
u v (6.13)	 d(u, v) = 1 + u v</text>

Going back to the particular case (6.1) we do indeed get a continuous 
map between the dual spaces 
L2(Bn) =(L2(Bn))  (C(Bn)) = M(Bn) . 
Here we use the Riesz representation theorem and duality for Hilbert 
spaces. The map use here is supposed to be linear not antilinear, i.e., 
(6.4) L2(Bn)  g  g dx  (C(Bn)) . 
So the idea is to make the space of test functions as small as reasonably 
possible, while still retaining density in reasonable spaces. 
Recall that a function u : Rn  C is dierentiable at x  Rn if there 
exists a  Cn such that 
(6.5) |u(x)  u(x)  a (x x)| = o(|x x|) . 
The little oh notation here means that given  &gt; 0 there exists  &gt; 0 
s.t. 
|x x| &lt;   |u(x)  u(x)  a(x x)| &lt; |x x| . 
The coecients of a = (a 1, . . ., a n) are the partial derivations of u at 
x, 
u ai = (x)xj 
since 
u(x+ tei)  u(x)(6.6) ai = lim , 
t0 t 
ei = (0, . . ., 1,0, . . ., 0) being the ith basis vector. The function u is 
said to be continuously dierentiable on Rn if it is dierentiable at each 
point x  Rn and each of the n partial derivatives are continuous, 
u (6.7) : Rn  C . xj 
Denition 6.2. Let C01(Rn) be the subspace of C0(Rn) = C00(Rn) such 
u that each element u  C01(Rn) is continuously dierentiable and xj  
C0(Rn), j = 1, . . ., n. 
Proposition 6.3. The function 
n  u uC1 = u +   x1i=1 
is a norm on C01(Rn) with respect to which it is a Banach space.</text>

1Denition 6.4. The space C0 k(Rn)  C0 (Rn) k  1 is dened induc
tively by requiring that 
u  C0 k1(Rn) , j = 1, . . ., n . xj 
The norm on C0 k (Rn) is taken to be 
n  u (6.8) uCk = uCk1 +   Ck1 . xjj=1 
These are all Banach spaces, since if {un}is Cauchy in C0 k (Rn), it is 
Cauchy and hence convergent in Ck1(Rn), as is un/xj , j = 1, . . ., n 0 
1.Furthermore the limits of the un/xj are the derivatives of the limits 
by Proposition 6.3. 
This gives us a sequence of spaces getting smoother and smoother 
1 kC00(Rn)  C0 (Rn)      C0 (Rn)     , 
with norms getting larger and larger. The duals can also be expected 
to get larger and larger as k increases. 
As well as looking at functions getting smoother and smoother, we 
need to think about innity, since Rn is not compact. Observe that 
an element g L1(Rn) (with respect to Lebesgue measure by default) 
kdenes a functional on C00(Rn)  and hence all the C0 (Rn)s. However a 
function such as the constant function 1 is not integrable on Rn . Since 
we certainly want to talk about this, and polynomials, we consider a 
second condition of smallness at innity. Let us set 
(6.9) x= (1 + |x|2)1/2 
a function which is the size of |x| for |x| large, but has the virtue of 
being smooth10 
Denition 6.5. For any k, l N = {1,2,  }set 
k  k kx lC0 (Rn) = u  C0 (Rn) ; u = x l v , v  C0 (Rn)  
, 
with norm, uk,l = vCk , v = xlu. 
kNotice that the denition just says that u = xlv, with v  C0 (Rn). 
It follows immediately that xlC0 k(Rn) is a Banach space with this 
norm. 
Denition 6.6. Schwartz space 11 of test functions on Rn is

(1 + u v)(1 + v  w)u w 
 (u v(1 + v w) + v  w(1 + u v))(1 + u w). 
Starting from the LHS and using the triangle inequality, 
LHS  u w + (u v + v  w + u vv w)u w
 (u v + v w + u vv  w)(1 + u w)
 RHS.
Thus, d is a metric. 
Suppose un is a Cauchy sequence. Thus, d(un, um)  0 as n, m  
. In particular, given 
 &gt; 0  N s.t. n, m &gt; N implies 
d(un, um) &lt; 2k  n, m &gt; N. 
The terms in (6.12) are all positive, so this implies 
un  um(k) &lt;   n, m &gt; N. 1 + un  um(k) 
If  &lt; 1/2 this in turn implies that 
un  um(k) &lt; 2, 
so the sequence is Cauchy in xk C0 k (Rn) for each k. From the com
pleteness of these spaces it follows that un  u in xk C0 k(Rn)j for 
each k. Given  &gt; 0 choose k so large that 2k &lt; /2. Then  N s.t. 
n &gt; N 
 u un(j) &lt; /2 n &gt; N, j  k.</text>

6. Test functions 
So far we have largely been dealing with integration. One thing we 
have seen is that, by considering dual spaces, we can think of functions 
as functionals. Let me briey review this idea. 
Consider the unit ball in Rn ,
n
B = {x Rn ; |x|  1} . 
I take the closed unit ball because I want to deal with a compact metric 
space. We have dealt with several Banach spaces of functions on Bn , 
for example 
C(Bn) = u: Bn  C ; u continuous 
2L2(Bn) = u: Bn  C; Borel measurable with |u|dx &lt; . 
Here, as always below, dxis Lebesgue measure and functions are iden
tied if they are equal almost everywhere. 
Since Bn is compact we have a natural inclusion 
(6.1) C(Bn)  L2(Bn) .
This is also a topological inclusion, i.e., is a bounded linear map, since
(6.2) uL2  Cu|| 
where C2 is the volume of the unit ball. 
In general if we have such a set up then 
Lemma 6.1. If V  U is a subspace with a stronger norm, 
U  CV   V 
then restriction gives a continuous linear map 
L= L|V  V ,   (6.3) U  V, U  L  LV   CL U  . 
If V is dense in U then the map (6.3) is injective. 
Proof. By denition of the dual norm 
  LV  = sup  L(v) ; vV  1 , v V 
  sup  L(v) ; vU  C , v V 
 sup {|L(u)| ; uU  C , u U} 
= CL U  . 
If V  U is dense then the vanishing of L : U  C on V implies its 
vanishing on U.</text>

These are measurable sets. On increasing n by one, the interval in the 
denition of En,k is divided into two. It follows that the sequence of 
simple functions 
(3.6) fn = + 2nE 2nkEk,n n 
k 
is increasing and has limit f and that this limit is uniform on any 
measurable set where f is nite.</text>

Proof. The continuity of f shows that f 1(E)  X is open if E  Y 
is open. By denition, the open sets generate the Borel -algebra on 
Y so the preceeding Lemma shows that f is Borel measurable i.e., 
f 1(B(Y ))  B(X). 
We are mainly interested in functions on X. If M is a -algebra 
on X then f : X  R is measurable if it is measurable with respect 
to the Borel -algebra on R and M on X. More generally, for an 
extended function f : X  [, ] we take as the Borel -algebra 
in [, ] the smallest -algebra containing all open subsets of R and 
all sets (a, ] and [, b); in fact it is generated by the sets (a, ]. 
(See Problem 6.) 
Our main task is to dene the integral of a measurable function: we 
start with simple functions. Observe that the characteristic function 
of a set  
E = 1 
0 x  E 
x / E 
is measurable if and only if E  M. More generally a simple function, 
N 
(3.5)	 f = aiEi , ai  R 
i=1 
is measurable if the Ei are measurable. The presentation, (3.5), of a 
simple function is not unique. We can make it so, getting the minimal 
presentation, by insisting that all the ai are non-zero and 
Ei = {x  E ; f (x) = ai} 
then f in (3.5) is measurable i all the Ei are measurable. 
The Lebesgue integral is based on approximation of functions by 
simple functions, so it is important to show that this is possible. 
Proposition 3.3. For any non-negative -measurable extended func
tion f : X  [0, ] there is an increasing sequence fn of simple 
measurable functions such that limn fn(x) = f (x) for each x  X 
and this limit is uniform on any measurable set on which f is nite. 
Proof. Folland [1] page 45 has a nice proof. For each integer n &gt; 0 and 
0  k  22n  1, set 
En,k = {x  X; 2nk  f (x) &lt; 2n(k + 1)}, 
E= {x  X; f (x)  2n}.n</text>

3. Measureability of functions 
Suppose that Mis a -algebra on a set X4 and N is a -algebra on 
another set Y. A map f : X Y is said to be measurable with respect 
to these given -algebras on X and Y if 
(3.1) f1(E)  M  E  N. 
Notice how similar this is to one of the characterizations of continuity 
for maps between metric spaces in terms of open sets. Indeed this 
analogy yields a useful result. 
Lemma 3.1. If G  N generates N, in the sense that 
(3.2) N = {N ; N  G, N a -algebra } 
then f : X Y is measurable i f1(A)  Mfor all A G. 
fProof. The main point to note here is that f1 as a map on power 
sets, is very well behaved for any map. That is if f : X  Y then 
1 : P(Y )  P(X) satises: 
f1(EC ) = (f1(E))C 
f1(Ej ) f1 Ej = 
j=1(3.3)  j=1  
f1(Ej ) f1 Ej = 
j=1 j=1 
f1() =  , f1(Y ) = X . 
Putting these things together one sees that if M is any -algebra on 
X then 
(3.4) f(M) = E Y ; f1(E)  M 
is always a -algebra on Y. 
In particular if f1(A)  M for all A G  N then f(M) is a -
algebra containing G, hence containing N by the generating condition. 
Thus f1(E)  M for all E  N so f is measurable.  
Proposition 3.2. Any continuous map f : X  Y between metric 
spaces is measurable with respect to the Borel -algebras on X and Y. 
4Then X, or if you want to be pedantic (X, M), is often said to be a measure 
space or even a measurable space.</text>

4. Integration 
The ()-integral of a non-negative simple function is by denition 
(4.1) f d = ai(Y Ei) , Y M. 
Yi 
Here the convention is that if (Y Ei) = but ai = 0 then ai (Y  
Ei) = 0. Clearly this integral takes values in [0,]. More signicantly, 
if c 0 is a constant and f and g are two non-negative (-measurable) 
simple functions then 
cfd = c fd 
Y Y 
(4.2) (f + g)d = fd + gd 
Y Y Y 
0 f g  f d  g d . 
Y Y 
(See [1] Proposition 2.13 on page 48.) 
To see this, observe that (4.1) holds for any presentation (3.5) of f 
with all ai 0. Indeed, by restriction to Ei and division by ai (which 
can be assumed non-zero) it is enough to consider the special case 
E = bj Fj . 
j 
SThe Fj can always be written as the union of a nite number, N , 
of disjoint measurable sets, Fj = lSj Gl where j = 1, . . ., N and 
j {1, . . ., N}. Thus 
bj (Fj ) = bj (G l) = (E) 
j j lSj 
since {j;lSj } bj = 1 for each j. 
From this all the statements follow easily. 
Denition 4.1. For a non-negative -measurable extended function 
f : X [0,] the integral (with respect to ) over any measurable 
set E X is 
(4.3) fd = sup{ hd; 0 h f, h simple and measurable.} 
E E 
By taking suprema, E fd has the rst and last properties in (4.2). 
It also has the middle property, but this is less obvious. To see this, we 
shall prove the basic Monotone convergence theorem (of Lebesgue). 
Before doing so however, note what the vanishing of the integral means.</text>

Lemma 4.8. If f and g are measurable then 
(4.13)  fgd  fpgq 
1for any 1 &lt; p &lt; , with p + 1 = 1. q 
Proof. If f= 0 or g= 0 the result is trivial, as it is if either is p q 
innite. Thus consider   f(x)   p   g(x)   q

 a = =   gq   fp

|f(x)g(x)| |f (x)|p |g(x)|q

Integrating over X we nd 
1 |f(x)g(x)|dfpgq X 
1 1  + = 1 . p q 
Since  
X fg d   X |fg|d this implies (4.13). 
The nal inequality we need is Minkowskis inequality. 
Proposition 4.9. If 1 &lt; p &lt; and f, g Lp(X, ) then 
(4.14) f + gp fp + gp . 
Proof. The case p = 1 you have already done. It is also obvious if 
f + g = 0 a.e.. If not we can write 
p1|f + g|p (|f|+ |g|) |f + g|
and apply Holders inequality, to the right side, expanded out, 
  &#13;
1/q 
|f + g|p d (fp + gp) , |f + g|q(p1) d . 
Since q(p 1) = p and 1 1 = 1/p this is just (4.14).  q 
So, now we know that Lp(X, ) is a normed space for 1 p &lt; . In 
particular it is a metric space. One important additional property that 
a metric space may have is completeness, meaning that every Cauchy 
sequence is convergent.</text>

The other important convergence result for integrals is Lebesgues 
Dominated convergence theorem. 
Theorem 4.6. If fn is a sequence of integrable functions, fk f a.e.5 
and |fn|g for some integrable g then f is integrable and 
f d = lim fnd . 
n 
Proof. First we can make the sequence fn(x) converge by changing all 
the fn(x)s to zero on a set of measure zero outside which they converge. 
This does not change the conclusions. Moreover, it suces to suppose 
that the fn are real-valued. Then consider 
hk = g fk 0 . 
Now, lim infk hk = g f by the convergence of fn; in particular f 
is integrable. By monotone convergence and Fatous lemma 
(g f )d = lim inf hk d lim inf (g fk) d 
k k 
= g d lim sup fk d . 
k 
Similarly, if Hk = g + fk then 
(g + f )d = lim inf Hk d  g d + lim inf fk d. 
k k 
It follows that 
lim sup fk d  f d lim inf fk d.

Thus in fact 
fk d  f d . 
Having proved Lebesgues theorem of dominated convergence, let 
me use it to show something important. As before, let  be a positive 
measure on X. We have dened L1(X, ); let me consider the more 
general space Lp(X, ). A measurable function 
f : X  C 
is said to be Lp, for 1  p &lt; , if |f|p is integrable6, i.e., 
|f|p d &lt;  . 
X 
As before we consider equivalence classes of such functions under the 
equivalence relation 
(4.9) f  g  {x; (f  g)(x) = 0} = 0 . 
We denote by Lp(X, ) the space of such equivalence classes. It is a 
linear space and the function 
 &#13;
1/p 
(4.10) fp = |f|p d 
X 
is a norm (we always assume 1  p &lt; , sometimes p = 1 is excluded 
but later p =  is allowed). It is straightforward to check everything 
except the triangle inequality. For this we start with 
Lemma 4.7. If a  0, b  0 and 0 &lt;  &lt; 1 then 
(4.11) a  b1  a+ (1  )b 
with equality only when a = b. 
Proof. If b = 0 this is easy. So assume b &gt; 0 and divide by b. Taking 
t = a/b we must show 
(4.12) t  t+ 1   , 0  t , 0 &lt;  &lt; 1 . 
tThe function f(t) = t  t is dierentiable for t &gt; 0 with derivative 
1  , which is positive for t &lt; 1 and negative for t &gt; 1. Thus 
f(t)  f(1) with equality only for t = 1. Since f(1) = 1  , this is 
(4.12), proving the lemma.  
We use this to prove Holders inequality

Next I want to return to our starting point and discuss the Riesz 
representation theorem. There are two important results in measure 
theory that I have not covered  I will get you to do most of them 
in the problems  namely the Hahn decomposition theorem and the 
Radon-Nikodym theorem. For the moment we can do without the 
latter, but I will use the former. 
So, consider a locally compact metric space, X. By a Borel measure 
on X, or a signed Borel measure, we shall mean a function on Borel 
sets 
 : B (X)  R 
which is given as the dierence of two nite positive Borel measures 
(4.16) (E) = 1(E)  2(E) . 
Similarly we shall say that  is Radon, or a signed Radon measure, if 
it can be written as such a dierence, with both 1 and 2 nite Radon 
measures. See the problems below for a discussion of this point. 
Let Mn(X) denote the set of nite Radon measures on X. This is 
a normed space with 
(4.17)   1 = inf( 1(X) + 2(X)) 
with the inmum over all Radon decompositions (4.16). Each signed 
Radon measure denes a continuous linear functional on C 0(X): 
(4.18)  d : C 0(X)  f  f  d . 
X 
Theorem 4.12 (Riesz representation.). If X is a locally compact met
ric space then every continuous linear functional on C 0(X) is given by 
a unique nite Radon measure on X through (4.18). 
Thus the dual space of C 0(X) is Mn(X)  at least this is how such 
a result is usually interpreted 
(4.19) (C 0(X)) = Mn(X), 
see the remarks following the proof. 
Proof. We have done half of this already. Let me remind you of the 
steps. 
uWe started with u  (C 0(X)) and showed that u = u+  u where 
 are positive continuous linear functionals; this is Lemma 1.5. Then 
we showed that u  0 denes a nite positive Radon measure . Here 
 is dened by (1.11) on open sets and (E) = (E) is given by (1.12)</text>

in terms of the natural presentation of g = aiFi . Now, the fact i 
that the En are measurable and increase to E shows that 
(E n  Fi)  (E  Fi) 
as n  . Thus the right side of (4.7) tends to c E gd as n  . 
Hence   c E gd for all 0 &lt; c &lt; 1. Taking the supremum over c and 
then over all such g shows that 
 = lim fnd  sup gd = f d. 
n E E E 
They must therefore be equal.  
Now for instance the additivity in (4.1) for f  0 and g  0 any 
measurable functions follows from Proposition 3.3. Thus if f  0 is 
measurable and fn is an approximating sequence as in the Proposition 
then E f d = limn fnd. So if f and g are two non-negative E 
measurable functions then fn(x) + gn(x)  f + g(x) which shows not 
only that f + g is measurable by also that 
(f + g)d = f d + gd. 
E E E 
As with the denition of u+ long ago, this allows us to extend the 
denition of the integral to any integrable function. 
Denition 4.4. A measurable extended function f : X  [, ] 
is said to be integrable on E if its positive and negative parts both have 
nite integrals over E, and then 
f d = f+d  fd. 
E E E 
Notice if f is -integrable then so is |f |. One of the objects we wish 
to study is the space of integrable functions. The fact that the integral 
of |f | can vanish encourages us to look at what at rst seems a much 
more complicated object. Namely we consider an equivalence relation 
between integrable functions 
(4.8) f1  f2  ({x  X; f1(x) = f2(x)}) = 0. 
That is we identify two such functions if they are equal o a set of 
measure zero. Clearly if f1  f2 in this sense then 
|f1|d = |f2|d = 0, f 1d = f2d. 
X X X X 
A necessary condition for a measurable function f  0 to be inte
grable is 
{x  X; f (x) = } = 0.</text>

Let E be the (necessarily measureable) set where f = . Indeed, if 
this does not have measure zero, then the sequence of simple functions 
nE  f has integral tending to innity. It follows that each equiva
lence class under (4.8) has a representative which is an honest function, 
i.e. which is nite everywhere. Namely if f is one representative then 
f (x) = f (x) x / E 
0 x  E 
is also a representative. 
We shall denote by L1(X, ) the space consisting of such equivalence 
classes of integrable functions. This is a normed linear space as I ask 
you to show in Problem 11. 
The monotone convergence theorem often occurrs in the slightly dis
guised form of Fatous Lemma. 
Lemma 4.5 (Fatou). If fk is a sequence of non-negative integrable 
functions then 
lim inf fn d  lim inf fn d . 
n n 
Proof. Set Fk(x) = infnk fn(x). Thus Fk is an increasing sequence of 
non-negative functions with limiting function lim infn fn and Fk (x)  
fn(x)  n  k. By the monotone convergence theorem 
lim inf fn d = lim Fk (x) d  lim inf fn d. 
n k n 
We further extend the integral to complex-valued functions, just say
ing that 
f : X  C 
is integrable if its real and imaginary parts are both integrable. Then, 
by denition, 
f d = Re f d + i Im f d 
E E E 
for any E  X measurable. It follows that if f is integrable then so is 
|f |. Furthermore 
 f d   |f | d .

Denition 4.10. A normed space in which the underlying metric space 
is complete is called a Banach space. 
Theorem 4.11. For any measure space (X, M, ) the spaces Lp(X, ), 
1  p &lt; , are Banach spaces. 
Proof. We need to show that a given Cauchy sequence {fn} converges 
in Lp(X, ). It suces to show that it has a convergent subsequence. 
By the Cauchy property, for each k  n = n(k) s.t. 
(4.15) fn  fp  2k    n . 
Consider the sequence 
g1 = f1 , gk = fn(k)  fn(k1) , k &gt; 1 . 
By (4.15), gkp  2k , for k &gt; 1, so the series  gkp converges, k 
say to B &lt; . Now set 
n  
hn(x) = |gk(x)| , n  1 , h(x) = gk(x). 
k=1 k=1 
Then by the monotone convergence theorem 
hp d = lim |hn|p d  Bp , 
nX X 
where we have also used Minkowskis inequality. Thus h  Lp(X, ), 
so the series 
 
f(x) = gk(x) 
k=1 
converges (absolutely) almost everywhere. Since 
p  n  
|f(x)|p = lim  gk  hp 
n   k=1 
with hp  L(X, ), the dominated convergence theorem applies and 
shows that f  Lp(X, ). Furthermore, 
gk(x) = fn()(x) and f(x)  fn()(x) p  (2h(x))p 
k=1 
so again by the dominated convergence theorem, 
f(x)  fn()(x) p  0 .

on general Borel sets. It is nite because 
(4.20) (X) = sup {u(f ) ; 0 f 1 , supp f 
 X , f C(X)} 
u . 
From Proposition 2.8 we conclude that  is a Radon measure. Since 
this argument applies to u we get two positive nite Radon measures 
 and hence a signed Radon measure 
(4.21)  = +  Mn(X). 
In the problems you are supposed to prove the Hahn decomposition 
theorem, in particular in Problem 14 I ask you to show that (4.21) is 
the Hahn decomposition of   this means that there is a Borel set 
E X such that (E) = 0 , +(X \E) = 0. 
What we have dened is a linear map 
(4.22) (C0(X)) M(X), u  . 
We want to show that this is an isomorphism, i.e., it is 1 1 and onto. 
We rst show that it is 1 1. That is, suppose  = 0. Given the 
uniqueness of the Hahn decomposition this implies that + =  = 0. 
So we can suppose that u 0 and  = + = 0 and we have to show 
that u = 0; this is obvious since 
(X) = sup {u(f ); supp u 
 X, 0 f 1 f C(X)}= 0 
(4.23) u(f ) = 0 for all such f . 
If 0  f  C(X) and supp f 
 X then f  = f /f  is of this type 
so u(f ) = 0 for every 0  f  C(X) of compact support. From 
the decomposition of continuous functions into positive and negative 
parts it follows that u(f ) = 0 for every f of compact support. Now, if 
f Co(X), then given n N there exists K 
 X such that |f |&lt; 1/n 
on X \K. As you showed in the problems, there exists  C(X) with 
supp() 
 X and  = 1 on K. Thus if fn = f then supp(f n) 
 X and 
f fn= sup(|f fn|&lt; 1/n. This shows that C0(X) is the closure 
of the subspace of continuous functions of compact support so by the 
assumed continuity of u, u = 0. 
So it remains to show that every nite Radon measure on X arises 
from (4.22). We do this by starting from  and constructing u. Again 
we use the Hahn decomposition of , as in (4.21)7 . Thus we assume 
 0 and construct u. It is obvious what we want, namely 
(4.24) u(f ) = f d , f Cc(X) . 
X 
7Actually we can just take any decomposition (4.21) into a dierence of positive 
Radon measures.</text>

Here we need to recall from Proposition 3.2 that continuous functions 
on X, a locally compact metric space, are (Borel) measurable. Further
more, we know that there is an increasing sequence of simple functions 
with limit f , so 
(4.25)  f d  (X) f  . 
X 
This shows that u in (4.24) is continuous and that its norm u  
(X). In fact 
(4.26) u= (X) . 
Indeed, the inner regularity of  implies that there is a compact set 
K 
 X with (K) (X)1 ; then there is f Cc(X) with 0 f 1 n 
and f = 1 on K. It follows that (f ) (K) (X)  1 , for any n. n 
This proves (4.26). 
We still have to show that if u is dened by (4.24), with  a nite 
positive Radon measure, then the measure  dened from u via (4.24) 
is precisely  itself. 
This is easy provided we keep things clear. Starting from   0 a 
nite Radon measure, dene u by (4.24) and, for U X open 
 (4.27) (U ) = sup f d, 0 f 1, f C(X), supp(f ) 
 U . 
X 
By the properties of the integral, (U ) (U ). Conversely if K 
 U 
there exists an element f  Cc(X), 0  f  1, f = 1 on K and 
supp(f ) U. Then we know that 
 (4.28) (U )  f d (K). 
X 
By the inner regularity of , we can choose K 
 U such that (K)  
(U ) , given  &gt; 0. Thus (U ) = (U ). 
This proves the Riesz representation theorem, modulo the decompo
sition of the measure - which I will do in class if the demand is there! 
In my view this is quite enough measure theory.  
Notice that we have in fact proved something stronger than the state
ment of the theorem. Namely we have shown that under the correspon
dence u , 
(4.29) u= ||(X) =: 1 . 
Thus the map is an isometry.</text>

5. Hilbert space 
We have shown that Lp(X, ) is a Banach space  a complete normed 
space. I shall next discuss the class of Hilbert spaces, a special class of 
Banach spaces, of which L2(X, ) is a standard example, in which the 
norm arises from an inner product, just as it does in Euclidean space. 
An inner product on a vector space V over C (one can do the real 
case too, not much changes) is a sesquilinear form 
V V C 
written (u, v), if u, v V. The sesqui- part is just linearity in the rst 
variable 
(5.1) (a1u1 + a2u2 , v) = a1(u1, v) + a2(u2, v), 
anti-linearly in the second 
(5.2) (u, a 1v1 + a2v2) = a1(u, v 1) + a2(u, v 2) 
and the conjugacy condition 
(5.3) (u, v) = (v, u) . 
Notice that (5.2) follows from (5.1) and (5.3). If we assume in addition 
the positivity condition8 
(5.4) (u, u) 0 , (u, u) = 0 u = 0 , 
then 
(5.5) u= (u, u)1/2 
is a norm on V, as we shall see. 
Suppose that u, v V have u= v= 1. Then (u, v) = ei |(u, v)| 
for some  R. By choice of , ei (u, v) = |(u, v)|is real, so expanding 
out using linearity for s R, 
i0 (e i usv , e usv) 
i 2 2 = u 2 2sRe e (u, v) + s v 2 = 1 2s|(u, v )|+ s . 
The minimum of this occurs when s = |(u, v)| and this is negative 
unless |(u, v)| 1. Using linearity, and checking the trivial cases u = 
or v = 0 shows that 
(5.6) |(u, v)|  uv , u, v V . 
This is called Schwarz9 inequality. 
8Notice that (u, u) is real by (5.3).
9No t in this Schwarz.</text>

Using Schwarz inequality 
2 u+ v 2 = u + (u, v) + (v, u) + v 2 
(u+ v)2 
= u + v  u + v u, v V 
which is the triangle inequality. 
Denition 5.1. A Hilbert space is a vector space V with an inner 
product satisfying (5.1) -(5.4) which is complete as a normed space 
(i.e., is a Banach space). 
Thus we have already shown L2(X, ) to be a Hilbert space for any 
positive measure . The inner product is 
(5.7)	 (f, g) = fg d , 
X 
since then (5.3) gives f2. 
Another important identity valid in any inner product spaces is the 
parallelogram law: 
2(5.8) u+ v 2 + uv 2 = 2u 2 + 2v . 
This can be used to prove the basic existence theorem in Hilbert space 
theory. 
Lemma 5.2. Let C H, in a Hilbert space, be closed and convex (i.e., 
su + (1 s)v  C if u, v  C and 0 &lt; s &lt; 1). Then C contains a 
unique element of smallest norm. 
Proof. We can certainly choose a sequence un C such that 
un  = inf {v; v C}. 
By the parallelogram law, 
2 un um 2 = 2un 2 + 2um	2  u n + um 
2) 422(u n 2 + um 
where we use the fact that (un + um)/2 C so must have norm at least 
. Thus {un}is a Cauchy sequence, hence convergent by the assumed 
completeness of H. Thus lim un = u C (since it is assumed closed) 
and by the triangle inequality 
|un  u|  u n u  0 
So u= . Uniqueness of u follows again from the parallelogram law 
which shows that if u=  then 
uu  22 4(u+ u)/2 2 0 .</text>

The fundamental fact about a Hilbert space is that each element 
v  H denes a continuous linear functional by 
H  u  (u, v)  C 
and conversely every continuous linear functional arises this way. This 
is also called the Riesz representation theorem. 
Proposition 5.3. If L : H  C is a continuous linear functional on 
a Hilbert space then this is a unique element v  H such that 
(5.9) Lu = (u, v)  u  H , 
Proof. Consider the linear space 
M = {u  H ; Lu = 0} 
the null space of L, a continuous linear functional on H. By the as
sumed continuity, M is closed. We can suppose that L is not identically 
zero (since then v = 0 in (5.9)). Thus there exists w / M . Consider 
w + M = {v  H ; v = w + u , u  M } . 
This is a closed convex subset of H. Applying Lemma 5.2 it has a 
unique smallest element, v  w + M . Since v minimizes the norm on 
w + M , 
2 2 v + su 2 = v + 2 Re(su, v) + s 2 u 
is stationary at s = 0. Thus Re(u, v) = 0  u  M , and the same 
argument with s replaced by is shows that (v, u) = 0  u  M . 
Now v  w + M , so Lv = Lw = 0. Consider the element w = 
w/Lw  H. Since Lw = 1, for any u  H 
L(u  (Lu)w ) = Lu  Lu = 0 . 
2It follows that u  (Lu)w  M so if w = w/w
(w , w)(u, w ) = ((Lu)w , w ) = Lu = Lu . w2 
The uniqueness of v follows from the positivity of the norm.  
Corollary 5.4. For any positive measure , any continuous linear 
functional 
L : L2(X, )  C 
is of the form 
Lf = fg d , g  L2(X, ) .

Notice the apparent power of abstract reasoning here! Although we 
seem to have constructed g out of nowhere, its existence follows from 
the completeness of L2(X, ), but it is very convenient to express the 
argument abstractly for a general Hilbert space.</text>

Proof. Take k = 0 rst. The subspace Cc 0(Rn) is dense in C0 (Rn), by 
cutting o outside a large ball. If v  Cc 0(Rn) has support in {|x| R} 
then 
v t  Cc (Rn)  S(Rn) 
has support in {|x| R + 1}. Since v t  v the result follows for 
k = 0. 
For k  1 the same argument works, since D(v t) = (DV )  
t.  
Corollary 8.5. The map from nite Radon measures 
(8.19) Mn(Rn)   u  S(Rn) 
is injective. 
Now, we want the same result for L2(Rn) (and maybe for Lp(Rn), 
1  p &lt; ). I leave the measure-theoretic part of the argument to 
you. 
Proposition 8.6. Elements of L2(Rn) are continuous in the mean 
i.e., 
|u(x + t) u(x)|2 dx = 0 . (8.20) lim 
|t|0 Rn 
This is Problem 24.
Using this we conclude that
(8.21) S(Rn) L2(Rn) is dense 
as before. First observe that the space of L2 functions of compact 
support is dense in L2(Rn), since 
|u(x)|2 dx = 0 u L2(Rn) . lim 
R |x|R 
LThen look back at the discussion of v , now v is replaced by u  
2 
c (Rn). The compactness of the support means that u L1(Rn) so in 
(8.22)
 u (x) = u(x y)(y)dy 
Rn 
the integral is absolutely convergent. Moreover 
|u (x + x ) u (x)| 
=
u(y)((x + x  y) (x y)) dy

when {|x| R}large enough. Thus u  is continuous and the same 
argument as before shows that 
u t  S(Rn) . 
Now to see that u t u, assuming u has compact support (or not) 
we estimate the integral 
|u t(x) u(x)|= (u(x y) u(x)) t(y) dy 
|u(x y) u(x)|t(y) dy . 
Using the same argument twice 
|u t(x) u(x)|2 dx 
 
  |u(x y) u(x)|t(y) |u(x y ) u(x)|t(y ) dx dy dy 
  
|u(x y) u(x)|2 t(y)t(y )dx dy dy
sup
 |u(x y) u(x)|
2 dx . 
|y|t 
Note that at the second step here I have used Schwarzs inequality with 
the integrand written as the product 
 1/2(y)1/2|u(x y) u(x)|1/2(y)1/2(y )  |u(x y ) u(x)| (y ) .t t t t 
Thus we now know that 
L2(Rn)  S(Rn) is injective. 
This means that all our usual spaces of functions sit inside S (Rn). 
Finally we can use convolution with t to show the existence of 
smooth partitions of unity. If K 
 U  Rn is a compact set in an 
open set then we have shown the existence of   Cc 0(Rn), with  = 1 
in some neighborhood of K and  = 1 in some neighborhood of K and 
supp( ) 
 U . 
Then consider  t for t small. In fact 
supp( t)  {p Rn ; dist(p, supp ) 2t} 
and similarly, 0  t 1 and 
 t = 1 at p if  = 1 on B(p, 2t) . 
Using this we get:</text>

All the derivatives of 1/ |x|2 are bounded in |x| 1, so from Leibnizs 
formula it follows that   S(Rn). Since 
 =
xj (xj ) 
j 
this shows that  of the form (8.26) is in the right side of (8.25). In 
general suppose   S(Rn). Then 
t d (x) (0) = (tx) dt dt0 (8.27) n t  (tx) dt . = xj xj 0j=1 
Certainly these integrals are C, but they may not decay rapidly at 
innity. However, choose   C(Rn) with  = 1 in |x|  1. Thenc 
(8.27) becomes, if (0) = 0, 
 =  + (1 ) 
n t  (tx) dt  S(Rnxj j + (1 ) , j ) .
 = =  xj 0j=1 
Since (1 ) is of the form (8.26), this proves (8.25). 
Our assumption on u is that xj u = 0, thus 
u() = 0   H 
by (8.25). Choosing  as above, a general   S(Rn) can be written 
 = (0)  +  ,   H. 
Then 
u() = (0)u() u = c , c = u() . 
This result is quite powerful, as we shall soon see. The Fourier 
transform of an element   S(Rn) is14

Proof. From (8.23), if   S(Rn), supp(u) supp(u). If x supp(u) 
then, by denition, u = 0 for some   S(Rn) with (x) = 0. Thus 
 = 0 on B(x, ) for  &gt; 0 suciently small. If   C(Rn) has support c  in B(x, ) then u = u = 0, where  C(Rn):c  
/ in B(x, )= 0 elsewhere . 
Thus, given K 
 Rn we can nd j  C(Rn), supported in such balls, c 
so that 
j j  1 on K but j u = 0. For given   C(Rn) apply c 
this to supp(). Then 
 =  
j  u() = 
(j u)() = 0 . 
j j 
Thus u = 0 on C(Rn), so u = 0.	 c 
CThe linear space of distributions of compact support will be denoted 
(Rn); it is often written E(Rn).c 
Now let us give a characterization of the delta function
() = (0)   S(Rn) ,
or at least the one-dimensional subspace of S (Rn) it spans. This is
based on the simple observation that (xj )(0) = 0 if   S(Rn)!
Proposition 8.10. If u  S(Rn) satises xj u = 0, j = 1,   , n then
u = c.
Proof. The main work is in characterizing the null space of  as a linear
functional, namely in showing that
(8.24) H= {  S(Rn); (0) = 0} 
can also be written as 
n	 
(8.25)	 H=  
  S(Rn);  =  
xj j , j  S(Rn) . 
j=1 
Clearly the right side of (8.25) is contained in the left. To see the 
converse, suppose rst that 
(8.26)	   S(Rn) ,  = 0 in |x|&lt; 1 . 
Then dene  0 |x|&lt; 1  = / |x|2 |x| 1 .</text>

compact set, so we can chose  &gt; 0 such that 
(8.6) sup |v(x + x  y) v(x y)| |(y)|dy &lt; /2 . 
|x|&lt; |y|R
|y|R
Combining (8.5) and (8.6) we conclude that v  is continuous. Finally, 
we conclude that 
0(8.7) v  C00(Rn) v   C0 (Rn) . 
For this we need to show that v  is small at innity, which follows 
from the fact that v is small at innity. Namely given  &gt; 0 there exists 
R &gt; 0 such that |v(y)|  if |y| R. Divide the integral dening the 
convolution into two 
|v (x)|  u(y)(x y)dy + |u(y)(x y)|dy 
|y|&gt;R y&lt;R 
/2  + u sup ||. 
B(x,R) 
Since   S(Rn) the last constant tends to 0 as |x|  . 
We can do much better than this! Assuming |x|  1 we can use 
Taylors formula with remainder to write 
  d n
xj j (z, x   (8.8) (z + x ) (z) = (z + tx) dt = ) . dt0 j=1 
As Problem 23 I ask you to check carefully that 
(8.9) j (z; x  )  S(Rn) depends continuously on x in |x | 1 . 
Going back to (8.3))we can use the translation and reection-invariance 
of Lebesgue measure to rewrite the integral (by changing variable) as 
(8.10)
 v (x) = v(y)(x y) dy . 
Rn 
This reverses the role of v and  and shows that if both v and  are in 
S(Rn) then v  =  v. 
Using this formula on (8.4) we nd

The continuity of u follows from the fact that integration is continuous 
and (8.29). Now observe that 
u(xj ) = xj () d 
Rn 
 = Dj  d = 0 
Rn 
where we use (8.30). Applying Proposition 8.10 we conclude that u = 
c for some (universal) constant c. By denition this means 
(8.34) () d = c(0) . 
Rn 
So what is the constant? To nd it we need to work out an example. 
The simplest one is 
 = exp( |x|2 /2) . 
Lemma 8.12. The Fourier transform of the Gaussian exp( |x|2 /2) 
is the Gaussian (2)n/2 exp( | |2 /2). 
Proof. There are two obvious methods  one uses complex analysis 
(Cauchys theorem) the other, which I shall follow, uses the uniqueness 
of solutions to ordinary dierential equations. 
2First observe that exp( |x|2 /2) = 
j exp(xj /2). Thus 16

  x2/2() =  
(j ) , (x) = e , 
j=1 
being a function of one variable. Now  satises the dierential equa
tion 
(x + x)  = 0 , 
and is the only solution of this equation up to a constant multiple. By 
(8.30) and (8.31) its Fourier transform satises 
x = i+ id = 0 . x +   
d 
ce||2 /2This is the same equation, but in the  variable. Thus = . 
Again we need to nd the constant. However, 
x(0) = c =  
e 2/2 dx = (2)1/2

8. Convolution and density
We have dened an inclusion map
(8.1) 
S(Rn)   u  S(Rn), u () = (x) (x) dx   S(Rn). 
Rn 
This allows us to think of S(Rn) as a subspace of S(Rn); that is we 
habitually identify u with . We can do this because we know (8.1) 
to be injective. We can extend the map (8.1) to include bigger spaces 
C

Lp(Rn)   u  S(Rn) 
(8.2) M (Rn)   u  S(Rn) 
u() =  d , 
Rn 
but we need to know that these maps are injective before we can forget 
about them. 
We can see this using convolution. This is a sort of product of 
functions. To begin with, suppose v  C0
0(Rn) and   S(Rn). We 
dene a new function by averaging v with respect to : 
(8.3) v (x) = v(x y)(y) dy . 
Rn 
The integral converges by dominated convergence, namely (y) is in
tegrable and v is bounded, 
|v(x y)(y)|  v 
C0
0|(y)|.
We can use the same sort of estimates to show that v  is continuous. 
Fix x Rn , 
(8.4) v (x + x ) v (x) 
= (v (x + x  y) v(x y))(y) dy . 
To see that this is small for x small, we split the integral into two 
pieces. Since  is very small near innity, given  &gt; 0 we can choose 
R so large that 
(8.5) v  | (y)|dy /4 .

(8.29) F : S(Rn)  S(Rn) , F =  .
Proof. Dierentiating under the integral15 sign shows that 
j () = i e ix xj (x) dx . 
Since the integral on the right is absolutely convergent that shows that 
(remember the is) 
(8.30) Dj  =  xj  ,   S(Rn) . 
ixSimilarly, if we multiply by j and observe that j eix = i  exj 
then integration by parts shows 
  (8.31) j  = i ( e ix )(x) dx xj  = i e ix dx xj 
 ,   S(Rn) . Dj  = j 
Since xj , Dj   S(Rn) these results can be iterated, showing that 
 (8.32) D  = F

 Thus D 
C sup

shows that F is continuous as a map (8.32). 
Suppose   S(Rn). Since   S(Rn) we can consider the distribu

Proof. The set dened by (7.19) is closed, since 
(7.20) supp(u) = {p Rn), (p) = 0, u = 0} ;   S(Rn
is clearly open  the same  works for nearby points. If   S(Rn) 
we dene u  S(Rn), which we will again identify with , by  
(7.21) u () = (x) (x) dx . 
Obviously u = 0 = = 0, simply set  =  in (7.21). Thus the 
map 
(7.22) S(Rn (Rn) )   u  S 
is injective. We want to show that 
(7.23) supp(u ) = supp( ) 
on the left given by (7.19) and on the right by (7.18). We show rst 
that 
supp(u ) supp( ). 
/ / Thus, we need to see that p  supp( )  p  supp(u ). The rst 
condition is that (x) = 0 in a neighbourhood, U of p, hence there 
is a C function  with support in U and (p) = 0. Then  0.  
Conversely suppose p / supp(u ). Then there exists   S(Rn) with 
(p) = 0 and u = 0, i.e., u () = 0   S(Rn). By the injectivity 
(Rn) this means  = 0, so  0 in a neighborhood of of S(Rn)  S
p and p /supp( ).  
Consider the simplest examples of distribution which are not func
tions, namely those with support at a given point p. The obvious one 
is the Dirac delta function 
(7.24) p() = (p)   S(Rn) . 
We can make many more, because D is local 
(7.25) supp(D u) supp(u) u  S (Rn) . 
Indeed, p /supp(u)    S(Rn), u 0, (p) = 0. Thus each of 
the distributions Dp also has support contained in 
{p}. In fact none 
of them vanish, and they are all linearly independent.</text>

Similarly we can dene the partial derivatives by using the standard 
integration by parts formula

Dj u() =  ). u(Dj )   S(Rn
Then it is clear that Dj u  S(Rn). 
Iterating these denition we nd that D , for any multi-index , 
denes a linear map 
(Rn(7.15) D : S (Rn) . )  S  
In general a linear dierential operator with constant coecients is a 
sum of such monomials. For example Laplaces operator is

We will be interested in trying to solve dierential equations such as 
(Rn) . u = f  S  
We can also multiply u  S(Rn) by   S(Rn), simply dening 
(7.16) u() = u()   S(Rn). 
For this to make sense it suces to check that 
      
(7.17) sup x D () C sup x D  . 
Rn Rn

||k ||k 
This follows easily from Leibniz formula. 
Now, to start thinking of u  S(Rn) as a generalized function we 
rst dene its support. Recall that 
(7.18) supp( ) = clos {x Rn; (x) = 0}.
We can write this in another weak way which is easier to generalize. 
Namely 
(7.19) p /supp(u)    S(Rn) , (p) = 0 , u = 0 . 
In fact this denition makes sense for any u  S(Rn). 
RLemma 7.5. The set supp(u) dened by (7.19) is a closed subset of 
n and reduces to (7.18) if u  S(Rn).</text>

7. Tempered distributions
A good rst reference for distributions is [2], [4] gives a more exhaus
tive treatment. 
The complete metric topology on S(Rn) is described above. Next I 
want to try to convice you that elements of its dual space S(Rn), have 
enough of the properties of functions that we can work with them as 
generalized functions. 
RFirst let me develop some notation. A dierentiable function  : 
n  C has partial derivatives which we have denoted /xj : Rn 
C. For reasons that will become clear later, we put a 1 into the 
denition and write 
1  (7.1) Dj  = . i xj 
We say  is once continuously dierentiable if each of these Dj  is 
continuous. Then we dened k times continuous dierentiability in
ductively by saying that  and the Dj  are (k 1)-times continuously 
dierentiable. For k = 2 this means that 
Dj Dk  are continuous for j, k = 1,    , n . 
Now, recall that, if continuous, these second derivatives are symmetric: 
(7.2) Dj Dk  = DkDj  . 
NThis means we can use a compact notation for higher derivatives. Put 
0 = {0, 1, . . .}; we call an element   Nn a multi-index and if  is0 
at least k times continuously dierentiable, we set12 
1 n 1 (7.3) D = i||  whenever = 1 + 2 + + n  k. x1    xn | |   
Now we have dened the spaces. 
0(7.4) C0 k (Rn) =  
 : Rn  .  C ; D  C 0 (Rn)  | |  k  
Notice the convention is that D is asserted to exist if it is required 
to be continuous! Using x = (1 + x2) we dened | | 
(7.5) x k 
0 k (Rn) =  
 : Rn  C ; 0 k (Rn)  
, C x k  C 
and then our space of test functions is 
S(Rn) = k k C0 (Rn) . x 
k 
Periodically there is the possibility of confusion between the two meanings of 
but it seldom arises. | | 12</text>

Lemma 10.6. For any  Nn there are polynomials p, (x) of degrees 0 
at most | | such that 
xk D v =  
D 
p, xk2||v 
. 
Proof. In fact it is convenient to prove a more general result. Suppose 
p is a polynomial of a degree at most j then there exist polynomials of 
degrees at most j + | | such that 
(10.11) pxk D v =  
D(p, xk2||v) . 
The lemma follows from this by taking p = 1. 
Furthermore, the identity (10.11) is trivial when  = 0, and proceed
ing by induction we can suppose it is known whenever || L. Taking 
||= L + 1, 
D = Dj D ||= L. 
Writing the identity for  as 
pxkD =  
D (p, xk2| |v) 
 
we may dierentiate with respect to xj . This gives 
k) D pxkD = Dj (px v 
xk2||+2 v) . +  
D (p  
 , 
The rst term on the right expands to 
((D j p)  xk D v  1 kpxj xk2D v) . i 
We may apply the inductive hypothesis to each of these terms and 
rewrite the result in the form (10.11); it is only necessary to check the 
order of the polynomials, and recall that x2 is a polynomial of degree 
2.  
Applying Lemma 10.6 to (10.10) gives (10.9), once negative powers 
of x are absorbed into the continuous functions. Then (10.8) follows 
from (10.9) and Leibnizs formula.</text>

10. Sobolev embedding 
The properties of Sobolev spaces are briey discussed above. If m 
is a positive integer then u  Hm(Rn) means that u has up to m 
derivatives in L2(Rn). The question naturally arises as to the sense 
in which these weak derivatives correspond to old-fashioned strong 
derivatives. Of course when m is not an integer it is a little harder 
to imagine what these fractional derivatives are. However the main 
result is: 
Theorem 10.1 (Sobolev embedding). If uHm(Rn) where m &gt; n/2 
then u C00(Rn), i.e., 
Hm(10.1) (Rn)  C00(Rn) , m &gt; n/2 . 
Proof. By denition, uHm(Rn) means v  S (Rn) and m u()  
L2(Rn). Suppose rst that u S(Rn). The Fourier inversion formula 
shows that 
ix 
(2)n |u(x)| =  
e u() d
1/2 
  
2m |()|2 d  
2m d 1/2 
. u
Rn Rn 
Now, if m &gt; n/2 then the second integral is nite. Since the rst 
integral is the norm on Hm(Rn) we see that 
(10.2) sup |u(x)| = u  (2)nuHm , m &gt; n/2 . L 
Rn 
This is all for u  S(Rn), but S(Rn)  Hm(Rn) is dense. The 
estimate (10.2) shows that if uj  u in Hm(Rn), with uj  S(Rn), 
0then uj  u in C0 (Rn). In fact u = u in S (Rn) since uj  u in 
 0L2(Rn) and uj uin C0 (Rn) both imply that 
 
uj converges, so 
uj  u= u  S(Rn). 
Rn Rn Rn 
Notice here the precise meaning of u= u , uHm(Rn) L2(Rn), 
 0u C0 (Rn). When identifying u  L2(Rn) with the corresponding 
tempered distribution, the values on any set of measure zero are lost. 
Thus as functions (10.1) means that each uHm(Rn) has a represen
0tative u  C0 (Rn). 
We can extend this to higher derivatives by noting that</text>

Thus every tempered distribution is a nite sum of derivatives of 
continuous functions of poynomial growth. 
Proof. Essentially by denition any u S(Rn) is continuous with re
spect to one of the norms xk Ck . From the Sobolev embedding 
theorem we deduce that, with m &gt; k + n/2, 
|u()|  CxkHm  S(Rn). 
This is the same as

linear map 
Dj : Hm(10.4)	 (Rn) Hm1(Rn) j

u mL2(Rn). Since  If mR then uHm(Rn) means  Dj u= 
uj , and 
m+1|j | m Cm  m 
we conclude that Dj uHm1(Rn) and 
Dj uHm1 CmuHm . 
Applying this result we see 
Corollary 10.3. If kN0 and m &gt; n + k then2 
Hm(10.5)	 (Rn)  C0 k (Rn) . 
0Proof. If ||  k, then Du  Hmk(Rn)  C0 (Rn). Thus the weak 
derivatives Duare continuous. Still we have to check that this means 
that u is itself k times continuously dierentiable. In fact this again 
follows from the density of S(Rn) in Hm(Rn). The continuity in (10.3) 
kimplies that if uj uin Hm(Rn), m &gt; n + k, then uj u in C0 (Rn)2 
k(using its completeness). However u= u as before, so u C0 (Rn). 
In particular we see that 
m(10.6)	 H(Rn) =

 if p  Sn1 then there exists a neigbourhood U  Bn of p such that 
U  Css(  U . Ru) = if Csp( R)  
Proof. First suppose p Rn . From the denition of conic singular sup-
(Sn1port, (12.37) means precisely that there exists   C ), () = 0 
and R such that 
(12.39) R(u)  S(Rn). 
Since we know that u  C(Rn), this is actually true for all R &gt; 0 
as soon as it is true for one value. Furthermore, if   C(Rn) has c 
supp()  {  / u) follows from   Css( = 0} then   Css(  / u ). 
Indeed we can then write  =  where   C(Rn) so it suces c 
to show that if v  C(Rn) has   Css(v) then   Css(/ v ) if c /
v = (2)n    C(Rn). Since  u where  =   S(Rn), applyingc 
Css(  Lemma 12.8 we see that Css( v) Css(v), so indeed  / u). 
The case that p Sn1 is similar. Namely we have one cut-o R 
= 0 and q /  Ru). We can take U = {R+10  with (p)   Css(  = 0}since if 
(Sn1
R has conic support in U then  
R = RR for some   C ). 
Thus 
 (12.40) Ru, v = 
R u = v 
R . 
From Lemma 12.11 and Corollary12.9 we deduce that 
 
R u) Css(  (12.41) Css( Ru) 
and hence the result follows with U  a small neighourhood of q.  
Proposition 12.14. For any u  S(Rn), 
(12.42) WFsc(u) (Bn Bn) = (Bn Sn1) (Sn1 Bn) 
= (Rn Sn1) (Sn1 Sn1) (Sn1 Rn) 
and WF(u)  Rn are closed sets and under projection onto the rst 
variable 
(12.43) 
1(WF(u)) = singsupp(u) Rn , 1(WF sc(u)) = Css(u) Bn . 
Proof. To prove the rst part of (12.43) we need to show that if ( x, ) /
WF(u) for all  Sn1 with  x /
 Sx Rn xed, then singsupp(u). The 
n1 
Cdenition (12.37) means that for each  there exists

closed and Sn1 is compact, a nite number of these cutos, j

covering Sn1 . Now applying Lemma 12.13 above, we can nd one</text>

One can also give a similar discussion of the convolution of two tem
pered distributions. Once again we do not have a denition of uvas a 
tempered distribution for all u,v S(Rn).We do know how to dene 
the convolution if either uor v is compactly supported, or if either is 
in S(Rn).This leads directly to 
Lemma 12.6. If Css(u) Sn1 = then uvis dened unambiguously 
by 
x (12.21) uv= u1 v+ u2 v, u1 = (1 ( ))u, u2 = uu1 r 
where  C(Rn) has (x) = 1 in |x|  1 and R is suciently large; c 
there is a similar denition if Css(v) Sn1 = . 
Proof. Since Css(u) Sn1 = ,we know that Css(u 1) = if Ris large 
enough, so then both terms on the right in (12.21) are well-dened. To 
see that the result is independent of Rjust observe that the dierence 
of the right-hand side for two values of Ris of the form wvwv 
with wcompactly supported.  
Now, we can go even further using a slightly more sophisticated 
decomposition based on 
Lemma 12.7. If u S(Rn) and Css(u)  = where  Sn1 is a 
closed set, then u= u1 + u2 where Csp(u 1)  = and u2  S(Rn); in 
fact 
  (12.22) u= u1 + u1 + u2 where u1  C(Rn) and c 
0 /supp(u1 ), xRn \ {0}, x/|x|   =x /supp(u1 ). 
Proof. A covering argument which you should provide.  
Let i Rn, i= 1,2,be closed cones. That is they are closed sets 
such that if xi and a&gt;0 then axi.Suppose in addition that 
(12.23) 1 (2) = {0}. 
That is, if x 1 and x  2 then x = 0. Then it follows that for 
some c&gt;0, 
(12.24) x1, y2 = |x+ y| c(|x|+ |y|). 
To see this consider x+ y where x  1, y  2 and |y|  |x|. We

Clearly |x|&lt; xand for 0 a &lt; 1, |x|= axhas only the solution 
1 
S|x|= a/(1 a2) 2 . Thus if we combine (12.9) with the identication of 
n with the unit sphere we get an identication 
(12.10) Rn Sn1 Bn . 
Using this identication we can, and will, regard Csp(u) and Css(u) as 
subsets of Bn . 21 
Lemma 12.3. For any u  S(Rn), Csp(u) and Css(u) are closed 
subsets of Bn and if  C(Sn) has supp( ) Css(u) = then for R 
suciently large Ru  S(Rn). 
Proof. Directly from the denition we know that Csp(u) Rn is closed, 
as is Css(u) Rn . Thus, in each case, we need to show that if  Sn1 
and  /Csp(u) then Csp(u) is disjoint from some neighbourhood of  
in Bn . However, by denition, 
U = {x Rn; R(x)  = 0} = 0}  { Sn1; () 
is such a neighbourhood. Thus the fact that Csp(u) is closed follows 
directly from the denition. The argument for Css(u) is essentially the 
same. 
The second result follows by the use of a partition of unity on Sn1 . 
Thus, for each point in supp( ) Sn1 there exists a conic localizer for 
which Ru  S(Rn). By compactness we may choose a nite number of 
these functions j such that the open sets {j () &gt; 0}cover supp( ). 
By assumption (j )Rj u  S(Rn) for some Rj &gt; 0. However this will 
remain true if Rj is increased, so we may suppose that Rj = R is 
independent of j. Then for function 
 =  
|j |2  C(Sn1) 
j 
we have Ru  S(Rn). Since =  for some   C(Sn1) it follows 
that R+1u  S(Rn) as claimed.  
Corollary 12.4. If u  S(Rn) then Css(u) =  if and only if u  
S(Rn). 
Proof. Certainly Css(u) = if u  S(Rn). If u  S(Rn) and Css(u) = 
 then from Lemma 12.3, Ru  S(Rn) where  = 1. Thus v = 
(1 R)u  C(Rn) has singsupp(v ) = so v  C(Rn) and hence c c 
u  S(Rn).  
21In fact while the topology here is correct the smooth structure on Bn is not  the right one  see Problem?? For our purposes here this issue is irrelevant.</text>

C(Rn). In that case we know that the singular support of the con-c 
volution is contained in the rst term in (12.29), so it is enough to 
consider the conic singular support in the sphere at innity. Thus, if 
 /  Css(u v). Using Lemma 12.7  Css(v) we need to show that  /
we can decompose v = v1 + v2 + v3 as a sum of a Schwartz term, a 
compact supported term and a term which does not have  in its conic 
support. Then u v1 is Schwartz, u v2 has compact support and sat
ises (12.29) and  is not in the cone support of u v3. Thus (12.29) 
holds in general.  
Lemma 12.10. If u, v  S(Rn) and   Css(u) Sn1 =  /
Css(v) then their convolution is dened unambiguously, using the pair
ing in Lemma 12.5, by 
(12.30) u v() = u(v )    S(Rn). 
v(x) = v(x), Css( Proof. Since  v) = Css(v) so applying Lemma 12.8 
we know that 
(12.31) Css(v )  Css(v) Sn1 . 
Thus, Css(v) Css(v ) =  and the pairing on the right in (12.30) 
is well-dened by Lemma 12.5. Continuity follows from your work in 
Problem 78.  
In Problem 79 I ask you to get a bound on Css(u v) Sn1 under 
the conditions in Lemma 12.10. 
Let me do what is actually a fundamental computation. 
Lemma 12.11. For a conic cuto, R, where   C(Sn1), 
(12.32) Css( R)  {0}. 
Proof. This is actually much easier than it seems. Namely we already 
know that D(R) is smooth and homogeneous of degree || near 
innity. From the same argument it follows that 
(12.33) D(x  R) L2(Rn) if ||&gt; ||+ n/2 
since this is a smooth function homogeneous of degree less than n/2 
near innity, hence square-integrable. Now, taking the Fourier trans
form gives 
(12.34) D ( R) L2(Rn)  ||&gt; ||+ n/2. 
If we localize in a cone near innity, using a (completely unrelated) 
cuto  
R () then we must get a Schwartz function since 
(12.35) 
R ()D ( R ()  |||| R) L2(Rn)  ||&gt; ||+ n/2 = R  S(Rn).</text>

The compactness of Sn1 means that there is a nite cover of Sn1 by 
such sets Uj . Now select a partition of unity i of Sn1 which is not 
only subordinate to this open cover, so each i is supported in one of 
the Uj but satises the additional condition that 
(12.54) supp( i)  ( supp( i )) =  = 
supp( i)  ( supp( i ))  Uj for some j. 
Now, if we set ui = (i)Ru, and vi = (i )Rv, we know that u   ui 
i 
has compact support and similarly for v. Since convolution is already 
known to be possible if (at least) one factor has compact support, it 
suces to dene ui  vi for every i, i . So, rst suppose that supp( i)  
( supp( i )) = . In this case we conclude from (12.54) that 
(12.55) Css( ui)  Css( vi ) = . 
Thus we may dene 
(12.56) ui  vi = uivi 
using (12.20). On the other hand if supp i  ( supp( i )) =  then 
(12.57) Css(u i)  ( Css(v i ))  Sn1 =  
and in this case we can dene ui  vi using Lemma 12.10. 
Thus with such a decomposition of u and v all terms in the convolu
tion are well-dened. Of course we should check that this denition is 
independent of choices made in the decomposition. I leave this to you. 
That the product is well-dened under condition (12.50) now follows 
if we dene it using convolution, i.e. as 
(12.58) uv = f  g, f = u, g = v. 
Indeed, using (12.47), (12.50) for u and v becomes (12.51) for f and 
g.</text>

Thus we have (12.45) in the forward direction. 
For reverse implication it follows directly that (p, q) /WFsc(u1) and 
that (p, q) /WFsc(u2).	  
This restatement of the denition makes it clear that there a high 
degree of symmetry under the Fourier transform 
Corollary 12.17. For any u  S(Rn), 
(12.47) (p, q) WFsc(u))  (q, p) WFsc(u). 
Proof. I suppose a corollary should not need a proof, but still . . . . The 
statement (12.47) is equivalent to 
(12.48) (p, q) /	 WFsc( WFsc(u)) =(q, p) / u) 
since the reverse is the same by Fourier inversion. By (12.45) the 
condition on the left is equivalent to u = u1 + u2 with p / Css(u 1), 
q /Css( u2). Hence equivalent to 
(12.49) u = v1 + v2, v1 = u2, v2 = (2)n u1 
Css(v 1), p / so q / Css( v2) which proves (12.47).  
Now, we can exploit these notions to rene our conditions under 
which pairing, the product and convolution can be dened. 
Theorem 12.18. For u, v  S(Rn) 
(12.50) uv  S(Rn) is unambiguously dened provided 
(p, ) WFsc(u) (Bn Sn1) =(p, ) /WFsc(v) 
and 
(12.51) u v  S(Rn) is unambiguously dened provided 
(, q) WFsc(u) (Sn1 Bn) =(, q) /WFsc(v). 
Proof. Let us consider convolution rst. The hypothesis, (12.51) means 
that for each  Sn1 
(12.52) 
{q Bn1; (, q) WFsc(u)}  {q Bn1; (, q) WFsc(v)}= . 
Now, the fact that WFsc is always a closed set means that (12.52) 
remains true near  in the sense that if U Sn1 is a suciently small 
neighbourhood of  then 
(12.53)	 {q Bn1;  U, ( , q) WFsc(u)} 
;  U, ( {q Bn1	, q) WFsc(v)}= .</text>

follows by the same argument with x and y interchanged, so (12.24) is 
a consequence of (12.23). 
Lemma 12.8. For any u  S(Rn) and   S(Rn), 
(12.25) Css( u) Css(u) Sn1 . 
Proof. We already know that uis smooth, so Css( u) Sn1 .Thus, 
we need to show that if  Sn1 and  / Css( u). Css(u) then  /
Fix such a point  Sn1 \Css(u) and take a closed set  Sn1 
which is a neighbourhood of  but which is still disjoint from Css(u) and 
then apply Lemma 12.7. The two terms u2, where u2  S(Rn) and 
u1 where u  C(Rn) are both in S(Rn) so we can assume that u1 c 
has the support properties of u1 . In particular there is a smaller closed 
subset 1 Sn1 which is still a neighbourhood of  but which does 
not meet 2, which is the closure of the complement of . If we replace 
these i by the closed cones of which they are the cross-sections then 
we are in the situation of (12.23) and (12.23), except for the signs. 
That is, there is a constant c &gt; 0 such that 
(12.26) |xy| c(|x|+ |y|). 
Now, we can assume that there is a cuto function R which has 
support in 2 and is such that u = Ru. For any conic cuto,  
R, with 
support in 1 
R(u) = Ru,(x  )= u(y),R(y)(12.27)  
R(x)(x y). 
The continuity of u means that this is estimated by some Schwartz 
seminorm

R(x)(x y))|(1 + |y|)k 
y,||k 
CN sup(1 + |x|+ |y|)N (1 + |y|)k CN (1 + |x|)N+k

for some Schwartz seminorm on . Here we have used the estimate 
(12.24), in the form (12.26), using the properties of the supports of 
 and R. Since this is true for any N and similar estimates hold R 
for the derivatives, it follows that  
R(u)  S(Rn) and hence that

Corollary 12.9. Under the conditions of Lemma 12.6 
(12.29) Css(u v) (singsupp(u) + singsupp(v )) (Css(v ) Sn1). 
Proof. We can apply Lemma 12.8 to the rst term in (12.21) to con
clude that it has conic singular support contained in the second term 
in (12.29). Thus it is enough to show that (12.29) holds when u</text>

12. Cone support and wavefront set 
In discussing the singular support of a tempered distibution above, 
notice that 
singsupp(u) =  
only implies that u  C(Rn), not as one might want, that u  S(Rn). 
We can however rene the concept of singular support a little to get 
this. 
RLet us think of the sphere Sn1 as the set of asymptotic directions in 
n . That is, we identify a point in Sn1 with a half-line {ax; a (0, )} 
= for 0 x Rn . Since two points give the same half-line if and only if 
they are positive multiples of each other, this means we think of the 
sphere as the quotient 
(12.1) Sn1 = (Rn \ {0})/R+ . 
Of course if we have a metric on Rn , for instance the usual Euclidean 
metric, then we can identify Sn1 with the unit sphere. However (12.1) 
does not require a choice of metric. 
Now, suppose we consider functions on Rn \{0}which are (positively) 
x) = f ( homogeneous of degree 0. That is f (ax), for all a &gt; 0, and 
they are just functions on Sn1 . Smooth functions on Sn1 correspond 
(if you like by denition) with smooth functions on Rn \ {0} which are 
homogeneous of degree 0. Let us take such a function   C(Rn \{0}), 
(ax) = (x) for all a &gt; 0. Now, to make this smooth on Rn we need 
to cut it o near 0. So choose a cuto function   C(Rn), with c 
(x) = 1 in |x|&lt; 1. Then 
(12.2) R(x) = (x)(1 (x/R ))  C(Rn), 
for any R &gt; 0. This function is supported in |x|  R. Now, if  has 
support near some point  Sn1 then for R large the corresponding 
function R will localize near  as a point at innity of Rn . Rather 
than try to understand this directly, let us consider a corresponding 
analytic construction. 
First of all, a function of the form R is a multiplier on S(Rn). That 
is, 
(12.3) R : S(Rn)  S (Rn). 
To see this, the main problem is to estimate the derivatives at innity, 
since the product of smooth functions is smooth. This in turn amounts 
to estimating the deriviatives of  in |x|  1. This we can do using the 
homogeneity.</text>

Indeed this argument applies anywhere that  = 0 and so shows that 
(12.32) holds.  
Now, we have obtained some reasonable looking conditions under 
which the product uv or the convolution uv of two elements of S(Rn) 
is dened. However, reasonable as they might be there is clearly a aw, 
or at least a deciency, in the discussion. We know that in the simplest 
of cases, 
v. (12.36) u v = u
Thus, it is very natural to expect a relationship between the conditions 
under which the product of the Fourier transforms is dened and the 
conditions under which the convolution is dened. Is there? Well, not 
much it would seem, since on the one hand we are considering the rela
tionship between Css(u) and Css(v) and on the other the relationship 
between Css(u) Sn1 and Css(v) Sn1 . If these are to be related, 
we would have to nd a relationship of some sort between Css(u) and 
Css(u). As we shall see, there is one but it is not very strong as can 
be guessed from Lemma 12.11. This is not so much a bad thing as a 
sign that we should look for another notion which combines aspects of 
both Css(u) and Css(u). This we will do through the notion of wave
front set. In fact we dene two related objects. The rst is the more 
conventional, the second is more natural in our present discussion. 
Denition 12.12. If u  S(Rn) we dene the wavefront set of u to 
be 
(12.37) WF(u) = {(x, ) Rn Sn1; 
  C(Rn), (x)   Css( = 0,  / u )} 
c 
and more generally the scattering wavefront set by 
(12.38) WFsc(u) = WF(u)  {(, p) Sn1 Bn; 
  C(Sn), ()  Css(  = 0, R &gt; 0 such that p /  Ru)} . 
So, the denition is really always the same. To show that (p, q) / 
WFsc(u) we need to nd a cuto  near p  depending on whether 
p Rn or p Sn1 this is either  =   C(Rn) with F = (p) = 0 c 
or a R where   C(Sn1) has (p)  Css(  = 0  such that q / u). 
One crucial property is 
Lemma 12.13. If (p, q) / WFsc(u) then if p  Rn there exists a 
neighbourhood U  Rn of p and a neighbourhood U  Bn of q such 
that for all   C(Rn) with support in U, U Css(u) = ; similarlyc</text>

  C(Rn), with support in 
j {j (x)  x)  = 0}and ( = 0, such that 
Css( j u) for each j and hence u  S(Rn) (since it is u)  Css(
 singsupp(u). The already smooth). Thus indeed it follows that x /
converse, that singsupp(u) implies ( WF(u) for all  Sn1

is immediate. 
The argument to prove the second part of (12.43) is similar. Since, by 
denition, WFsc(u)(RnBn) = WF(u) and Css(u)Rn = singsupp(u) 
we only need consider points in Css(u) Sn1 . Now, we rst check that 
if  / Css(u) then {} Bn WFsc(u) = . By denition of Css(u) 
there is a cut-o R, where   C(Sn1) and () = 0, such that 
Ru  S(Rn). From (12.38) this implies that (, p) / WFsc(u) for all 
p Bn . 
Now, Lemma 12.13 allows us to apply the same argument as used 
above for WF . Namely we are given that (, p) / WFsc(u) for all 
p  Bn . Thus, for each p we may nd R , depending on p, such that 
()   Css(  = 0 and p /  Ru). Since Bn is compact, we may choose a 
nite subset of these conic localizers, (j) such that the intersection Rj 
of the corresponding sets Css( (j)u), is empty, i.e. their complements Rj 
cover Bn . Now, using Lemma 12.13 we may choose one  with support 
= 0} with ()  in the intersection of the sets {(j)  = 0 and one R 
such that Css( Ru) = , but this just means that Ru  S(Rn) and so 
 /Css(u) as desired. 
The fact that these sets are closed (in the appropriate sets) follows 
directly from Lemma12.13.  
Corollary 12.15. For u  S(Rn), 
(12.44) WFsc(u) =   u  S(Rn). 
Let me return to the denition of WFsc(u) and rewrite it, using what 
we have learned so far, in terms of a decomposition of u. 
Proposition 12.16. For any u  S(Rn) and (p, q) (Bn Bn), 
(12.45) (p, q) /WFsc(u)   
Css(u 1), q / u = u1 + u2, u1, u2  S (Rn), p / Css( u2). 
Proof. For given (p, q) / WFsc(u), take  =   C(Rn) with   1c 
near p, if p Rn or  = R with   C(Sn1) and  1 near p, if 
p Sn1 . In either case p /Css(u 1) if u1 = (1 )u directly from the 
denition. So u2 = u u1 = u. If the support of  is small enough it 
follows as in the discussion in the proof of Proposition 12.14 that

Lemma 12.1. If  C(Rn \ {0}) is homogeneous of degree 0 then 
|||(12.4) |D| C|x . 
Proof. I should not have even called this a lemma. By the chain rule, 
the derivative of order is a homogeneous function of degree ||from 
which (12.4) follows.  
For the smoothed versio, R,of this gives the estimates
||
(12.5) |DR(x)| Cx . 
This allows us to estimate the derivatives of the product of a Schwartz 
function and R : 
(12.6) x  D(Rf) 
 = 
 
D Rx  D f = sup |x  D(Rf)| Csup fk 
|x|1 
for some seminorm on S(Rn).Thus the map (12.3) is actually continu
ous. This continuity means that R is a multiplier on S(Rn),dened 
as usual by duality: 
(12.7) Ru(f) = u(Rf) f  S(Rn). 
RDenition 12.2. The cone-support and cone-singular-support of a tem
pered distribution are the subsets Csp(u)  Rn Sn1 and Css(u)  
n Sn1 dened by the conditions 
(12.8) 
Csp(u) Rn = supp(u) 
(Csp(u)) Sn1 ={Sn1;
(Sn1

Css(u) Rn = singsupp(u) 
(Css(u)) Sn1 ={Sn1; 
(Sn1R&gt;0,  C ), () = 0, Ru S(Rn)}. 
That is, on the Rn part these are the same sets as before but at 
innity they are dened by conic localization on Sn1 . 
In considering Csp(u) and Css(u) it is convenient to combine Rn 
and Sn1 into a compactication of Rn . To do so (topologically) let 
us identify Rn with the interior of the unit ball with respect to the 
Euclidean metric using the map

Of course we should check that this denition is independent of the 
cut-o function used in it. However, if we go through the denition and 
choose a dierent function  to start with, extend it homogeneoulsy 
and cut o (probably at a dierent R) and then nd a correction term 
 then the 1-parameter linear homotopy between them 
(12.16) 1(t) = t1 + (1 t)1 , t [0, 1] 
satises all the conditions required of 1 in formula (12.14). Thus in 
fact we get a smooth family of pairings, which we can write for the 
moment as 
(12.17) (u1, u2)t = u1(1(t)u2) + u2((1 1(t))u 1). 
By inspection, this is an ane-linear function of t with derivative 
(12.18) u1((1 1 )u2) + u2(( 1))u1).1 
Now, we just have to justify moving the smooth function in (12.18) to 
see that this gives zero. This should be possible since Csp( 1) is 1 
disjoint from both K1 and K2. 
KIn fact, to be very careful for once, we should construct another 
function  in the same way as we constructed 1 to be homogenous 
near innity and smooth and such that Csp() is also disjoint from both 
1 and K2 but  = 1 on Csp( 1). Then ( 1) =  1 so1 1 1 
we can insert it in (12.18) and justify 
(12.19) u1((1 1 )u2) = u1(2(1 1 )u2) = (u1)(( 1 1 )u2) 
= (u2)(1 1 )u1) = u2(1 1 )u1). 
Here the second equality is just the identity for  as a (multiplica
tive) linear map on S(Rn) and hence S(Rn) and the operation to give 
the crucial, third, equality is permissible because both elements are in 
S(Rn).  
Once we have dened the pairing between tempered distibutions with 
disjoint conic singular supports, in the sense of (12.14), (12.15), we can 
dene the product under the same conditions. Namely to dene the 
product of say u1 and u2 we simply set 
(12.20) u1u2() = u1(u2) = u2(u1)   S(Rn), 
provided Css(u 1) Css(u 2) = . 
Indeed, this would be true if one of u1 or u2 was itself in S(Rn) and 
makes sense in general. I leave it to you to check the continuity state
ment required to prove that the product is actually a tempered disti
bution (Problem 78).</text>

Of course the analogous result for Csp(u), that Csp(u) =  if and 
only if u = 0 follows from the fact that this is true if supp(u) = . I 
will treat a few other properties as self-evident. For instance 
(12.11)

and 
(12.12) Csp(c 1u1 + c2u2) Csp(u 1) Csp(u 2), 
Css(c 1u1 + c2u2) Css(u 1) Css(u 2)

is that we can discuss sucient conditions to allow us to multiply dis
tributions; we will get better conditions below using the same idea but 
applied to the wavefront set but this preliminary discussion is used 
there. In general the product of two distributions is not dened, and 
indeed not denable, as a distribution. However, we can always multi
ply an element of S(Rn) and an element of S(Rn). 
To try to understand multiplication look at the question of pairing 
between two distributions. 
Lemma 12.5. If Ki  Bn, i = 1,2, are two disjoint closed (hence 
compact) subsets then we can dene an unambiguous pairing 
(12.13) 
{u  S(Rn); Css(u) K1}  {u  S(Rn); Css(u) K2} (u1,u2) 
 u1(u2) C. 
Proof. To dene the pairing, choose a function   C(Sn1) which is 
identically equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of K1 Sn1 and with support 
disjoint from K2 Sn1 . Then extend it to be homogeneous, as above, 
and cut o to get R. If R is large enough Csp( R) is disjoint from K2. 
Then R + (1 )R = 1 +  where   C(Rn). We can nd another c 
function   C(Rn) such that 1 = R +  = 1 in a neighbourhood of c 
uK1 and with Csp( 1) disjoint from K2. Once we have this, for u1 and 
2 as in (12.13), 
(12.14) 1u2  S(Rn) and (1 1)u1  S(Rn) 
since in both cases Css is empty from the denition. Thus we can dene 
the desired pairing between u1 and u2 by 
(12.15) u1(u2) = u1(1u2) + u2((1 1)u1).</text>

16. Spectral theorem 
For a bounded operator T on a Hilbert space we dene the spectrum 
as the set 
(16.1) spec(T ) = {z C; T z Id is not invertible }. 
Proposition 16.1. For any bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space 
spec(T ) C is a compact subset of {|z|  T }. 
Proof. We show that the set C \spec(T ) (generally called the resolvent 
set of T ) is open and contains the complement of a suciently large 
ball. This is based on the convergence of the Neumann series. Namely 
if T is bounded and T &lt; 1 then 

(16.2) (Id T )1 = T j 
j=0 
converges to a bounded operator which is a two-sided inverse of Id T. 
Indeed, T j   T j so the series is convergent and composing with 
Id T on either side gives a telescoping series reducing to the identity. 
Applying this result, we rst see that 
(16.3) (T z) = z(Id T /z) 
is invertible if |z|&gt; T . Similarly, if (T z0 )1 exists for some z0 C 
then 
(16.4) (T z) = (T z0)(z z0 ) = (T z0)1(Id (z z0 )(T z0)1) 
exists for |z z0|(T z0)1&lt; 1.  
In general it is rather dicult to precisely locate spec(T ). 
However for a bounded self-adjoint operator it is easier. One sign of 
this is the the norm of the operator has an alternative, simple, charac
terization. Namely 
(16.5) if A = A then sup A, |= A. 
=1 
If a is this supermum, then clearly a  A. To see the converse, choose 
any ,   H with norm 1 and then replace  by ei  with  chosen 
so that A,  is real. Then use the polarization identity to write 
(16.6) 4A, = A( + ), ( + )  A( ), ( ) 
+ iA( + i), ( + i) iA( i), ( i). 
Now, by the assumed reality we may drop the last two terms and see 
that 
2 2(16.7) 4|A, | a( + 2 +  ) = 2a( + 2) = 4a.</text>

against a unique Radon measure , : 
(16.20)	 f(A),  = fd,. 
[m,M ] 
The total mass |, | of this measure is the norm of the functional. 
Since it is a Borel measure, we can take the integral on ,b] for any 
b  R ad, with the uniqueness, this shows that we have a continuous 
sesquilinear map 
(16.21) 
Pb(,) : HH  (,)  d,  R, |Pb(,)|  A . 
[m,b] 
From the Hilbert space Riesz representation theorem it follows that 
this sesquilinear form denes, and is determined by, a bounded linear 
operator 
(16.22) Pb(,) = Pb,, Pb  A. 
In fact, from the functional calculus (the multiplicativity in (16.18)) 
we see that 
(16.23) P = Pb, P2 = Pb, Pb  1,b b 
so Pb is a projection. 
Thus the spectral theorem gives us an increasing (with b) family of 
commuting self-adjoint projections such that , ((,b]) = Pb, 
determines the Radon measure for which (16.20) holds. One can go 
further and think of Pb itself as determining a measure 
(16.24)	 ((,b]) = Pb 
which takes values in the projections on H and which allows the func
tions of A to be written as integrals in the form 
(16.25)	 f(A) = fd 
[m,M ] 
of which (16.20) becomes the weak form. To do so one needs to 
develop the theory of such measures and the corresponding integrals. 
This is not so hard but I shall not do it.</text>

Thus indeed A= sup= =1 |A, |= a. 
We can always subtract a real constant from A so that A = A t 
satises 
(16.8)  inf A, = sup A, = A. 
=1 =1 
Then, it follows that A  A is not invertible. Indeed, there exists a 
sequence n, with n= 1 such that (A  A)n, n 0. Thus 
(16.9) 
2 2(AA)n= 2An, n+An+A2  2An, n+2A2 0. 
This shows that A Acannot be invertible and the same argument 
works for A + A. For the original operator A if we set 
(16.10) m = inf A,  M = sup A,  
=1 =1 
then we conclude that neither A m Id nor A M Id is invertible and 
A= max(m, M ). 
Proposition 16.2. If A is a bounded self-adjoint operator then, with 
m and M dened by (16.10) , 
(16.11) {m}  {M } spec(A) [m, M ]. 
Proof. We have already shown the rst part, that m and M are in 
the spectrum so it remains to show that A  z is invertible for all 
z C \[m, M ]. 
Using the self-adjointness 
(16.12) Im(A z), = Im z2 . 
This implies that A z is invertible if z  C \R. First it shows that 
(A z) = 0 implies  = 0, so A z is injective. Secondly, the range is 
closed. Indeed, if (A z)n  then applying (16.12) directly shows 
that n is bounded and so can be replaced by a weakly convergent 
subsequence. Applying (16.12) again to n m shows that the se
quence is actually Cauchy, hence convergens to  so (A z) =  is in 
the range. Finally, the orthocomplement to this range is the null space 
of A z, which is also trivial, so A z is an isomorphism and (16.12) 
also shows that the inverse is bounded, in fact 
1 (16.13) (A z)1  . |Im z| 
When z R we can replace A by A satisfying (16.8). Then we have 
to show that A z is inverible for |z|&gt; A, but that is shown in the 
proof of Proposition 16.1.</text>

The basic estimate leading to the spectral theorem is: 
Proposition 16.3. If A is a bounded self-adjoint operator and p is a 
real polynomial in one variable, 
i 
i=0 N 
(16.14) p(t) = cit, cN = 0, 
i=0 
(16.15) p(A)  sup |p(t)|. 
t[m,M ] 
Proof. Clearly, p(A) is a bounded self-adjoint operator. If s /p([m, M]) 
then p(A) s is invertible. Indeed, the roots of p(t) s must cannot 
lie in [m.M], since otherwise s p([m, M]). Thus, factorizing p(s) t 
we have 
(16.16) N ciAithen p(A) = satises
ci=1
N 
since p(A) = (A ti(s)) and each of the factors is invertible. 
i 
Thus spec(p(A))  p([m, M]), which is an interval (or a point), and 
from Proposition 16.3 we conclude that p(A)  sup p([m, M]) which N 
is (16.15). 
Now, reinterpreting (16.15) we have a linear map 
(16.17) P(R) p p(A)  B(H) 
from the real polynomials to the bounded self-adjoint operators which 
is continuous with respect to the supremum norm on [m, M]. Since 
polynomials are dense in continuous functions on nite intervals, we 
see that (16.17) extends by continuity to a linear map 
(16.18)
C([m, M]) f f (A)  B(H), f (A)  f [m,M ], f g(A) = f (A)g(A)
where the multiplicativity follows by continuity together with the fact 
that it is true for polynomials. 
Now, consider any two elements ,  H. Evaluating f (A) on  and 
pairing with  gives a linear map 
(16.19) C([m, M]) f  f (A),  C. 
This is a linear functional on C([m, M]) to which we can apply the Riesz 
representatin theorem and conclude that it is dened by integration =(p(A) s)1 p(t) s = cN (t ti(s)), ti(s) /[m, M] exists</text>

Finally we can use convolution with tto show the existence of
smooth partitions of unity. If K U Rnis a compact set in an
0open set then we have shown the existence of Cc(Rn), with= 1

8.Convolution and density 
We have dened an inclusion map
(8.1)
S(Rn (Rn), u() =(x) (x)dxS(Rn). )uS
Rn
This allows us to think of S(Rn) as a subspace of S(Rn); that is we
habitually identify uwith.We can do this because we know (8.1)
to be injective. We can extend the map (8.1) to include bigger spaces
0 (Rn) C0(Rn)uS
Lp(Rn)uS(Rn)
(8.2) M(Rn) uS(Rn)
u() =d,
Rn
but we need to know that these maps are injective before we can forget
about them.
We can see this using convolution. This is a sort of product of
0functions. To begin with, suppose v C0(Rn) and S(Rn). We
dene a new function by averaging vwith respect to :
(8.3) v(x) =v(xy)(y)dy.
Rn
The integral converges by dominated convergence, namely (y) is in
tegrable and vis bounded,
|
v(xy)(y)|vC0
0|
(y)
.|
We can use the same sort of estimates to show that vis continuous.
FixxRn,
(8.4)v(x+x)v(x)
= (v (x+x y)v(xy))(y)dy.
To see that this is small for x small, we split the integral into two
pieces. Since is very small near innity, given  &gt;0 we can choose
Rso large that

LetEbe the (necessarily measureable) set where f=.Indeed, if
this does not have measure zero, then the sequence of simple functions
nE fhas integral tending to innity. It follows that each equiva
lence class under (4.8) has a representative which is an honest function,
i.e.which is nite everywhere. Namely if fis one representative then
f(x)x /f(x) = E
0x E
is also a representative.
We shall denote by L1(X, ) the space consisting of such equivalence
classes of integrable functions. This is a normed linear space as I ask
you to show in Problem 11.
The monotone convergence theorem often occurrs in the slightly dis
guised form of Fatous Lemma.

We further extend the integral to complexvalued functions, just say
ing that

Proof. From (8.23), if S(Rn),supp(u )supp(u). If xsupp(u)
then, by denition, u= 0 for some S(Rn) with(x) = 0. Thus

 inB(x,) thenu=u = 0, where C(Rn):c
=/ inB(x,)
0 elsewhere .
Thus, given K Rnwe can nd jC(Rn), supported in such balls, c
so that j 1 onKbutju= 0. For given  C(Rn) applyj c
this to supp(). Then
=ju() = ( ju)() = 0.
j j
Thusu= 0 onC(Rn), sou= 0. c
The linear space of distributions of compact support will be denoted
C(Rn); it is often written E(Rn).c
Now let us give a characterization of the delta function
() =(0)S(Rn),
or at least the onedimensional subspace of S(Rn) it spans. This is
based on the simple observation that (x j)(0) = 0 if S(Rn)!
Proposition 8.10. IfuS(Rn)satisesxju= 0,j= 1,,nthen
u=c.
Proof. The main work is in characterizing the null space of as a linear
functional, namely in showing that

can also be written as

(8.25)H=S(Rn);=xjj, jS(Rn).

This is certainly nite since u(g) Cg  Cf. Moreover, if
0&lt; c R thenu+(cf) =cu+(f) by inspection. Suppose 0  fi 
0(X) fori= 1,2. Then given  &gt; 0 there exist 0(X) with C gi C
0gi(x)fi(x) and
u+(fi)u(gi) +.
It follows that 0g(x)f1(x) +f2(x) ifg=g1+g2so
u+(f1+f2)u(g) =u(g 1) +u(g 2)u+(f1) +u+(f2)2.
Thus
u+(f1+f2)u+(f1) +u+(f2).
Conversely, if 0 g(x) f1(x) +f2(x) setg1(x) = min(g,f 1) 
0(X) andg2=gg1. Then 0 gi fiandu+(f1) +u+(f2) C
u(g 1) +u(g 2) =u(g). Taking the supremum over g,u+(f1+f2) 
u+(f1) +u+(f2), so we nd
(1.9) u+(f1+f2) =u+(f1) +u+(f2).
Having shown this eective linearity on the positive functions we can
obtain a linear functional by setting
(1.10) u+(f) =u+(f+)u+(f 0(X). )fC
Note that (1.9) shows that u+(f) =u+(f1)u+(f2) for any decom
posiiton off=f1f2withfiC 0(X),both positive. [Since f1+f=
f2+f+sou+(f1) +u+(f) =u+(f2) +u+(f+).] Moreover,
u+(f)max(u +(f+),u(f | | ))uf 
= u.u+
The functional
u=u+u  
is also positive, since u+(f) u(f) for all 0 f C0(x). Thus we
have proved
Lemma 1.5. Any element u(C0(X)) can be decomposed,
u=u+u 
into the dierence of positive elements with
u u. u+, 
The idea behind the denition of u+is thatuitself is, more or less,
integration against a function (even though we do notknow how to
interpret this yet). In dening u+fromuwe are eectively throwing
away the negative part of that function. The next step is to show that
a positive functional corresponds to a measure meaning a function</text>

Having proved Lebesgues theorem of dominated convergence, let
me use it to show something important. As before, let be a positive
measure on X. We have dened L1(X,); let me consider the more
general space Lp(X,). A measurable function
f:XC 
is said to be Lp, for 1 p&lt;, iffpis integrable6, i.e.,
fpd&lt; .| |
X
As before we consider equivalence classes of such functions under the
equivalence relation
(4.9) f g {x; (f g)(x) = 0} = 0.
We denote by Lp(X,) the space of such equivalence classes. It is a
linear space and the function
 1/p
(4.10) fp=|f|pd
X
is a norm (we always assume 1  p&lt;, sometimes p= 1 is excluded
but laterp= is allowed). It is straightforward to check everything
except the triangle inequality. For this we start with
Lemma 4.7. Ifa 0,b 0and0&lt; &lt; 1then
(4.11) ab1 a+ (1 )b
with equality only when a=b.
Proof. Ifb= 0 this is easy. So assume b &gt;0 and divide by b. Taking
t=a/bwe must show
(4.12) t t+ 1 ,0 t,0&lt; &lt; 1.
The function f(t) =t tis dierentiable for t &gt;0 with derivative
t1 , which is positive for t &lt;1 and negative for t &gt;1.Thus
f(t) f(1) with equality only for t= 1. Sincef(1) = 1 , this is
(4.12), proving the lemma.

Indeed this argument applies anywhere that = 0 and so shows that
(12.32) holds.
 
Now, we have obtained some reasonable looking conditions under
which the product uvor the convolution uvof two elements of S(Rn)
is dened. However, reasonable as they might be there is clearly a aw,
or at least a deciency, in the discussion. We know that in the simplest
of cases,
(12.36)  =uuvv.
Thus, it is very natural to expect a relationship between the conditionsunder which the product of the Fourier transforms is dened and theconditions under which the convolution is dened. Is there? Well, not
much it would seem, since on the one hand we are considering the rela
tionship between Css( 
u) and Css(v) and on the other the relationship
between Css(u)Sn1and Css(v )Sn1.If these are to be related,
we would have to nd a relationship of some sort between Css(u) and
Css(u).As we shall see, there is one but it is not very strong as can
be guessed from Lemma 12.11. This is not so much a bad thing as a
sign that we should look for another notion which combines aspects of
both Css(u) and Css( u).This we will do through the notion of wave
front set. In fact we dene two related objects. The rst is the more
conventional, the second is more natural in our present discussion.
Denition 12.12. IfuS(Rn)we dene the wavefront set ofuto
be
(12.37) WF(u) ={(x, )RnSn1;
  Css( (Rn), (x) = 0,  / u) } 
cC
and more generally the scattering wavefront set by
(12.38) WF sc(u) = WF(u){(,p)Sn1Bn;
Css( ), () = 0, R&gt; 0such thatp /  Ru)} . C(Sn
So, the denition is really always the same. To show that (p,q )/
WF sc(u) we need to nd a cuto  near p  depending on whether
pRnorpSn1this is either  = (Rn) withF=(p) = 0cC
  Css( or aRwhere C(Sn1) has(p) = 0  such that q / u).
One crucial property is

Corollary 8.5. The map from nite Radon measures

11.Differential operators. 
In the last third of the course we will apply what we have learned
about distributions, and a little more, to understand properties of dif
ferential operators with constant coecients. Before I start talking
about these, I want to prove another density result.
So far we have notdened a topology on S(Rn)  I will leave this
as an optional exercise.18However we shall consider a notion of con
vergence. Suppose uj S(Rn) is a sequence in S(Rn). It is said to
converge weakly touS(Rn) if
(11.1) uj() ). u()S(Rn
There is no uniformity assumed here, it is rather like pointwise con
vergence (except the linearity of the functions makes it seem stronger).
Proposition 11.1. The subspaceS(Rn) S(Rn)is weakly dense,
i.e., eachuS(Rn)is the weak limit of a subspace ujS(Rn).
Proof. We can use Schwartz representation theorem to write, for some
mdepending on u,
mu=xDu, uL2(Rn).
||m
We know thatS(Rn) is dense in L2(Rn), in the sense of metric spaces
so we can nd u,jS(Rn),u,juinL2(Rn). The density result
then follows from the basic properties of weak convergence.  
Proposition 11.2. Ifuj uanduj u weakly inS(Rn)then
cujcu,uj+uju+u,DujDuandxmxmuweakly uj
inS(Rn).
Proof. This follows by writing everyting in terms of pairings, for exam
ple ifS(Rn)
Duj() =uj((1)()D)u((1)()D) =Du().
This weak density shows that our denition of Dj, andxj are
unique if we require Proposition 11.2 to hold.
We have discussed dierentiation as an operator (meaning just a
linear map between spaces of functionlike objects)

Proof. The Hilbert space property follows essentially directly from the
denition (9.14) since mL2(Rn) is a Hilbert space with the norm
(9.17). Similarly the density of S inHm(Rn) follows, sinceS(Rn) dense
inL2(Rn) (Problem L11.P3) implies mS(Rn) =S(Rn) is dense in
mL2(Rn) and so, sinceF is an isomorphism in S(Rn),S(Rn) is
dense inHm(Rn).
Finally observe that the pairing in (9.18) makes sense, since mu(),
u()L2(Rn) implies m
u())u()L1(Rn).
Furthermore, by the selfduality of L2(Rn) each continuous linear func
tional
U:Hm(Rn)C , U(u)CuHm
can be written uniquely in the form
U(u) = ((u,u)) for some u Hm(Rn).
then Notice that if u,u S(Rn) 
((u,u)) =u(x)u(x)dx.
Rn
This is always how we pair functions  it is the natural pairing on
L2(Rn). Thus in (9.18) what we have shown is that this pairing on test
function
S(Rn)(u,u((u,u)) =u(x)u(x)dx )S(Rn)
Rn
extends by continuity toHm(Rn)Hm(Rn) (for each xed m) when
it identies Hm(Rn) as the dual of Hm(Rn). This was our picture
at the beginning.
Form &gt; 0 the spaces Hm(Rn) represents elements of L2(Rn) that

against a unique Radon measure ,:
(16.20)	 f(A), =fd,.
[m,M ]
The total mass ,| of this measure is the norm of the functional.|
Since it is a Borel measure, we can take the integral on ,b] for any
b R ad, with the uniqueness, this shows that we have a continuous
sesquilinear map
(16.21)
Pb(, ) :HH (, ) d, R, Pb(, )| A. |
[m,b]
From the Hilbert space Riesz representation theorem it follows that
this sesquilinear form denes, and is determined by, a bounded linear
operator
(16.22) Pb(, ) =Pb,,Pb  A.
In fact, from the functional calculus (the multiplicativity in (16.18))
we see that
(16.23) P =Pb, P2=Pb,Pb  1,b b
soPbis a projection.
Thus the spectral theorem gives us an increasing (with b) family of
commuting selfadjoint projections such that ,((,b]) =Pb,
determines the Radon measure for which (16.20) holds. One can gofurther and think of P
bitself as determining a measure
(16.24)	 ((,b]) =Pb

tions ofAto be written as integrals in the form

Going back to the particular case (6.1) we do indeed get a continuous
map between the dual spaces
2L2(Bn)(L(Bn))  (C(Bn)) =M(Bn). =
Here we use the Riesz representation theorem and duality for Hilbert
spaces. The map use here is supposed to be linear not antilinear, i.e.,
(6.4) L2(Bn) g gdx (C(Bn)) .
So the idea is to make the space of test functions as small as reasonably
possible, while still retaining density in reasonable spaces.

5.Hilbert space 
We have shown that Lp(X,) is a Banach space  a complete normed
space. I shall next discuss the class of Hilbert spaces, a special class of
Banach spaces, of which L2(X, ) is a standard example, in which the
norm arises from an inner product, just as it does in Euclidean space.
An inner product on a vector space VoverC (one can do the real
case too, not much changes) is a sesquilinear form
VVC 
written (u,v ), ifu,v V. The sesqui part is just linearity in the rst
variable
(5.1) (a1u1+a2u2, v) =a1(u1,v) +a2(u2,v),
antilinearly in the second
(5.2) (u,a 1v1+a2v2) =a1(u,v 1) +a2(u,v 2)
and the conjugacy condition
(5.3) (u,v) =(v,u).

Lemma 10.6. For anyNn
0there are polynomials p,(x)of degrees
at mostsuch that
v=Dp,xk2||v . xkD

Proof. In fact it is convenient to prove a more general result. Suppose
pis a polynomial of a degree at most jthen there exist polynomials of
degrees at most j+such that
(10.11) pxkDv=D(p,xk2||v).

The lemma follows from this by taking p= 1.
Furthermore, the identity (10.11) is trivial when = 0, and proceed
ing by induction we can suppose it is known whenever ||L. Taking
=L+ 1,| |
D=DjD |=L.|
Writing the identity for  as
pxkD =D (p,xk2||v)
 
we may dierentiate with respect to xj.This gives
pxkD=Dj(pxk)D v
 
+2+D (pxk2||v)., 
||
The rst term on the right expands to
1xkD v kpxjxk2D v). ((Djp)i
We may apply the inductive hypothesis to each of these terms and
rewrite the result in the form (10.11); it is only necessary to check the
order of the polynomials, and recall that 2is a polynomial of degreex
2.  
Applying Lemma 10.6 to (10.10) gives (10.9), once negative powers
ofx are absorbed into the continuous functions. Then (10.8) follows
from (10.9) and Leibnizs formula.</text>

Proof. The continuity of fshows that f1(E) Xis open ifE Y
is open. By denition, the open sets generate the Borel algebra on
Yso the preceeding Lemma shows that fis Borel measurable i.e.,
f1(B(Y)) B(X).
We are mainly interested in functions on X.IfM is aalgebra
onXthenf:XR ismeasurable if it is measurable with respect 
to the Borel algebra on R andM onX.More generally, for an
extended function f:X [ ] we take as the Borel algebra  ,
in [,] the smallest algebra containing all open subsets of R and
all sets (a,] and [,b); in fact it is generated by the sets ( a,].
(See Problem 6.)
Our main task is to dene the integral of a measurable function: we
start with simple functions. Observe that the characteristic function
of a set
E=1x E
0x / E
is measurable if and only if E M.More generally a simple function,
N
(3.5)	 f=aiEi, ai R 
i=1
is measurable if the Eiare measurable. The presentation, (3.5), of a
simple function is not unique. We can make it so, getting the minimal
presentation, by insisting that all the aiare nonzero and
Ei={x E;f(x) =ai} 
thenfin (3.5) is measurable i all the Eiare measurable.
The Lebesgue integral is based on approximation of functions by
simple functions, so it is important to show that this is possible.
Proposition 3.3. For any nonnegative measurable extended func
tionf:X [0,]there is an increasing sequence fnof simple
measurable functions such that limn fn(x) =f(x)for eachx X
and this limit is uniform on any measurable set on which fis nite.

IfmR thenuHm(Rn) means 2(Rn). SinceDju= umL

The argument above shows that x(x) is a continuous function
ofx Rnwith values inS(Rn), souis continuous and satises
(11.15). It is therefore an element of S(Rn).
Dierentiability follows in the same way since for each j, withejthe
jth unit vector
(x+sejy)(xy))sS(Rn
is continuous in x Rn,s R. Thus,uhas continuous partial
derivatives and
Dju=uDj.
The same argument then shows that uC(Rn). ThatDj(u) =
Djufollows from the denition of derivative of distributions
Dj(u(x)) = (uDj)(x)
=u,Dxj(xy)=u(y),Dyj(xy)y 
= (Dju).
Finally consider the support property. Here we are assuming that
supp() is compact; we also know that supp(u) is a closed set. We
have to show that
(11.16) x /supp(u) + supp()
impliesu(x) = 0 forx nearx. Now (11.16) just means that
(11.17) supp(x)supp(u) =,
Since supp (x) ={yRn;xysupp()}, so both statements
mean that there is noysupp() with xysupp(u). This can also
be written
supp()suppu(x) =
and as we showed when discussing supports implies
u(x) =u(x ),= 0.
From (11.17) this is an open condition on x, so the support property
follows.

6.Test functions 
So far we have largely been dealing with integration. One thing we
have seen is that, by considering dual spaces, we can think of functions
as functionals. Let me briey review this idea.
Consider the unit ball in Rn,
Bn={x Rn;x| | 1} .
I take the closed unit ball because I want to deal with a compact metric
space. We have dealt with several Banach spaces of functions on Bn,
for example
C(Bn) =u:BnC ;ucontinuous
2L2(Bn) =u:BnC; Borel measurable with u dx&lt; .  | | 
Here, as always below, dxis Lebesgue measure and functions are iden
tied if they are equal almost everywhere.
SinceBnis compact we have a natural inclusion
2(6.1) C(Bn) L (Bn). 
This is also a topological inclusion, i.e., is a bounded linear map, since
(6.2) uL2  Cu|| 
whereC2is the volume of the unit ball.
In general if we have such a set up then
Lemma 6.1. IfV  Uis a subspace with a stronger norm,
U CV  V
then restriction gives a continuous linear map
(6.3)U V, U  L  LV CLU.  L=L|V V, 
IfVis dense in Uthen the map (6.3) is injective.
Proof. By denition of the dual norm
L  L(v);vV 1, v V = supV
L(v);vU C, v V  sup
 sup{|L(u) ;uU C, u U | } 
=CLU.
IfV Uis dense then the vanishing of L:UC onVimplies its
vanishing on U.</text>

 singsupp(u). The already smooth). Thus indeed it follows that x /
converse, that singsupp(u) implies ( WF(u) for all Sn1
x / x,)/
is immediate.
The argument to prove the second part of (12.43) is similar. Since, by
denition, WF sc(u)(RnBn) = WF(u) and Css( u)Rn= singsupp(u)
we only need consider points in Css(u) Sn1.Now, we rst check that
if / Css(u) then{}BnWF sc(u) =.By denition of Css( u) 
there is a cuto R,where C(Sn1) and() = 0, such that
RuS(Rn).From (12.38) this implies that (,p) /WF sc(u) for all
pBn.
Now, Lemma 12.13 allows us to apply the same argument as used
above for WF .Namely we are given that (,p )/ WF sc(u) for all
pBn.Thus, for each pwe may nd R,depending on p,such that
 Css( () =0 andp /  Ru).SinceBnis compact, we may choose a
nite subset of these conic localizers, (j)such that the intersectionRj
of the corresponding sets Css((j)u),is empty, i.e. their complementsRj
coverBn.Now, using Lemma 12.13 we may choose one with support
in the intersection of the sets {(j)= 0} with() = 0 and one R
such that Css( Ru) =,but this just means that RuS(Rn) and so
 /Css(u) as desired.
The fact that these sets are closed (in the appropriate sets) follows
directly from Lemma12.13.  
Corollary 12.15. ForuS(Rn),
(12.44) WF sc(u) =uS(Rn).
Let me return to the denition of WF sc(u) and rewrite it, using what
we have learned so far, in terms of a decomposition of u.
Proposition 12.16. For any(Rn)and(p,q)(BnBn), uS

pSn1.In either case p /Css(u1) ifu1= (1)udirectly from the
denition. So u2=uu1= u. If the support of  is small enough it

It remains to show the converse of (11.26) where P(D) is assumed to

ifx /sing supp(P (D)u) we can arrange that

Proof. First suppose pRn.From the denition of conic singular sup
port, (12.37) means precisely that there exists C(Sn1),() = 0
andRsuch that
(12.39) R(u)S(Rn).
Since we know that uC(Rn),this is actually true for all R &gt; 0
as soon as it is true for one value. Furthermore, if  C(Rn) hasc
 Css(  Css( supp() {= 0} then / u) follows from  / u).
Indeed we can then write  =where C(Rn) so it sucesc
to show that if v C(Rn) has /  Css(  Css(v) then / v ) ifc
v= (2 )n (Rn).Since uwhere =S(Rn),applyingcC
Css( Lemma 12.8 we see that Css( v)Css(v),so indeed / u).
The case that pSn1is similar. Namely we have one cuto R

Thus

From Lemma 12.11 and Corollary12.9 we deduce that
u)Css( (12.41) Css( Ru)R 
and hence the result follows with U a small neighourhood of q. 
Proposition 12.14. For anyuS(Rn),
(12.42) WF sc(u)(BnBn) = (BnSn1)(Sn1Bn)
= (RnSn1)(Sn1Sn1)(Sn1Rn)
andWF(u) Rnare closed sets and under projection onto the rst
variable
(12.43)
1(WF(u)) = singsupp( u)Rn,  1(WF sc(u)) = Css(u)Bn.
Proof. To prove the rst part of (12.43) we need to show that if ( x,)/
 x / WF(u) for all Sn1withxRnxed, then singsupp(u). The
denition (12.37) means that for each  Sn1there exists  
(Rn) with(  Css( x) = 0 such that  /  u).Since Css(u) iscC
closed and Sn1is compact, a nite number of these cutos, j

Proof. This is Problem 7.2.  
All this messing about with norms shows that
xj:S(Rn) andDj:S(Rn) )S(Rn)S(Rn

So now we have some idea of what uS(Rn) means. Lets notice
thatuS(Rn) implies
(7.9)(Rn)j= xjuS 1,,n
(7.10) DjuS(Rn)j= 1,,n
(7.11) uS(Rn) )S(Rn

ThisunuinS(Rn).	  
As well as the Schwartz space, S(Rn),of functions of rapid decrease
with all derivatives, there is a smaller standard space of test functions,
namely
(6.14)Cc(Rn) = ); supp( u) Rn}, {uS(Rn
the space of smooth functions of compact support. Again, it is notquite obvious that this has any nontrivial elements, but it does aswe shall see. If we x a compact subset of R
nand look at functions
with support in that set, for instance the closed ball of radius R &gt; 0,
then we get a closed subspace of S(Rn),hence a complete metric space.
One problem with C(Rn) is that it does not have a complete metricc
topology which restricts to this topology on the subsets. Rather wemust use an inductive limit procedure to get a decent topology.
Just to show that this is not really hard, I will discuss it briey
here, but it is not used in the sequel. In particular I will not do this
in the lectures themselves. By denition our space C(Rn) (denotedc
traditionally asD(Rn)) is a countable union of subspaces

This is a topology on C(Rn)  contains the empty set and the wholec
space and is closed under nite intersections and arbitrary unions 
simply because the same is true for the open sets in C(B(n)) for each
n.This is in fact the inductive limit topology. One obvious question
is: what does it mean for a linear functional u:Cc(Rn)C to be
continuous? This just means that u1(O) is open for each open set in C.

kThe norm onC0(Rn)is taken to be
n u(6.8) uCk=uCk1 +Ck1 .   xjj=1
kThese are all Banach spaces, since if {un}is Cauchy inC0(Rn), it is
Cauchy and hence convergent in Ck1(Rn), as isun/xj,j= 1,...,n0
1.Furthermore the limits of the un/xjare the derivatives of the limits
by Proposition 6.3.
This gives us a sequence of spaces getting smoother and smoother
C00(Rn

with norms getting larger and larger. The duals can also be expected
to get larger and larger as kincreases.
As well as looking at functions getting smoother and smoother, we
need to think about innity, since Rnis not compact. Observe that
an element gL1(Rn) (with respect to Lebesgue measure by default)
0 kdenes a functional on C0(Rn)  and hence alltheC0(Rn)s. However a
function such as the constant function 1 is notintegrable on Rn.Since
we certainly want to talk about this, and polynomials, we consider a
second condition of smallness at innity. Let us set

being smooth10

Lemma 12.1. IfC(Rn\{0})is homogeneous of degree 0then
(12.4) |Dx||.|C| |
Proof. I should not have even called this a lemma. By the chain rule,
the derivative of order is a homogeneous function of degree |from
which (12.4) follows.|
 
For the smoothed versio, R,ofthis gives the estimates
(12.5) |DR(x)x||.|C
This allows us to estimate the derivatives of the product of a Schwartz
function and R:
(12.6)xD(Rf)
 =DRxDf= supxD(Rf)Csupfk| | 
|x|1
for some seminorm on S(Rn).Thus the map (12.3) is actually continu
ous. This continuity means that Ris a multiplier on S(Rn),dened
as usual by duality:
(12.7) Ru(f) =u(Rf)fS(Rn).
Denition 12.2. The conesupport and conesingularsupport of a tem
pered distribution are the subsets Csp(u) RnSn1andCss(u)
RnSn1dened by the conditions
(12.8)
Csp(u)Rn= supp(u)

Css(u)Rn= singsupp(u)
(Css(u)) Sn1={Sn1;
R&gt; 0, C(Sn1), () = 0,  Ru . S (Rn)}
That is, on the Rnpart these are the same sets as before but at
innity they are dened by conic localization on Sn1.
In considering Csp(u) and Css(u) it is convenient to combine Rn
andSn1into a compactication of Rn.To do so (topologically) let
us identify Rnwith the interior of the unit ball with respect to the
Euclidean metric using the map

Dju() =u(Dj)S(Rn).
Then it is clear that DjuS(Rn).
Iterating these denition we nd that D, for any multiindex ,
denes a linear map
(7.15) D:S(Rn)S(Rn).
In general a linear dierential operator with constant coecients is a
sum of such monomials. For example Laplaces operator is

We will be interested in trying to solve dierential equations such as

We can write this in another weak way which is easier to generalize.
Namely
(7.19) p /supp(u) S(Rn), (p) = 0, u = 0.
In fact this denition makes sense for anyuS(Rn).

We can even continue in the same vein. A Borel measure is said to
beouter regular onEXif
(2.6) (E) = inf{(U) ;UE, U open}.
Thus the measure constructed in Proposition 2.5 is outer regular on all
Borel sets! A Borel measure is inner regular onEif
(2.7) (E) = sup{(K) ;KE, K compact}.
Here we need to know that compact sets are Borel measurable. Thisis Problem 5.
Denition 2.7. ARadon measure (on a metric space) is a Borel mea
sure which is outer regular on all Borel sets, inner regular on open sets
and nite on compact sets.
Proposition 2.8.	 The measure dened by (1.11), (1.12) from 0u 
0(X)) using Caratheodorys theorem is a Radon measure. (C
Proof. SupposeKXis compact. Let Kbe the characteristic func
tion ofK, K= 1 onK, K= 0 onKC. SupposefC 0(X),supp(f ) 
XandfK. Set
U=xX;f(x)&gt;1 { } 
where &gt; 0 is small. Thus Uis open, by the continuity of fand
containsK. Moreover, we can choose gC(X),supp(g ) U,0 
g1 withg= 1 near3K. Thus,g(1)1fand hence
(K)u(g) = (1)1u(f).
Letting0, and using the measurability of K,
(K)u(f)
(K) = inf{u(f) ;fC(X),supp(f ) X ,fK}.
In particular this implies that (K)&lt;ifK X, but is also proves
(2.7).  
Let me now review a little of what we have done. We used the
positive functional uto dene an outer measure , hence a measure
and then checked the properties of the latter.
This is a pretty nice scheme; getting ahead of myself a little, let me
suggest that we try it on something else.

local integrability follows from the estimate, using polar coordinates,

Dierentiating directly in the region where it is smooth,
x(x+iy)1=(x+iy)2, y(x+iy)1=i(x iy)2

Here the integrals are absolutely convergent, justifying the exchange of

Proof. Setting=in (9.5) shows that
(9.7) FL2 = (2 )n/2L2 .
In particular this proves, given the known density of S(Rn) inL2(Rn),
thatF is an isomorphism, with inverse G, as in (9.6).

C(Rn).In that case we know that the singular support of the conc
volution is contained in the rst term in (12.29), so it is enough to
consider the conic singular support in the sphere at innity. Thus, if
 Css(v) we need to show that  /  /  Css(uv).Using Lemma 12.7
we can decompose v=v1+v2+v3as a sum of a Schwartz term, a
compact supported term and a term which does not have in its conic
support. Then uv1is Schwartz, uv2has compact support and sat
ises (12.29) and is not in the cone support of uv3.Thus (12.29)
holds in general.  
Lemma 12.10. Ifu, v S(Rn)and Css(u)Sn1=  /
Css(v)then their convolution is dened unambiguously, using the pair
ing in Lemma 12.5, by
(12.30) uv() =u( ). v)S(Rn
v(x) =v(x),Css( Proof. Since  v) =Css(v) so applying Lemma 12.8
we know that
(12.31) Css(v)Css(v)Sn1.
Thus, Css(v )Css(v) = and the pairing on the right in (12.30)
is welldened by Lemma 12.5. Continuity follows from your work inProblem 78.  
In Problem 79 I ask you to get a bound on Css(u v)Sn1under
the conditions in Lemma 12.10.
Let me do what is actually a fundamental computation.
Lemma 12.11. For a conic cuto, R,whereC(Sn1),
(12.32) Css(.R){0}
Proof. This is actually much easier than it seems. Namely we already
know that D(R) is smooth and homogeneous of degree |near|
innity. From the same argument it follows that
(12.33) D(xR)L2(Rn) if &gt;  +n/2| | | |
since this is a smooth function homogeneous of degree less than n/2
near innity, hence squareintegrable. Now, taking the Fourier transform gives
(12.34) D(| | | | R)L2(Rn) &gt;  +n/2.
If we localize in a cone near innity, using a (completely unrelated)
cutoR () then we must get a Schwartz function since

They must therefore be equal.

between integrable functions

which is the triangle inequality.
Denition 5.1. A Hilbert space is a vector space Vwith an inner
product satisfying (5.1) (5.4) which is complete as a normed space
(i.e., is a Banach space).
Thus we have already shown L2(X,) to be a Hilbert space for any
positive measure . The inner product is
(5.7) (f,g) =fgd,
X
since then (5.3) gives f2.
Another important identity valid in any inner product spaces is the
parallelogram law:
2 2(5.8) u+v2+uv= 2u2+ 2v.
This can be used to prove the basic existence theorem in Hilbert space
theory.
Lemma 5.2. LetCH, in a Hilbert space, be closed and convex (i.e.,
su+ (1s)v Cifu,v Cand0&lt; s &lt; 1). ThenCcontains a
unique element of smallest norm.

By the parallelogram law,
2 2 2unum= 2un2+ 2umun+um

where we use the fact that (u n+um)/2Cso must have norm at least

the properties of convolution. Similarly if Tis such that supp( f)

supp(u)supp(f ) + supp(E ){tT].
So we need to show uniqueness. If u1,u2SRnin two solutions of
(11.43) then their dierence v=u1u2satises the homogeneous
equation ( t+ )v = 0. Furthermore, v= 0 int &lt; T for someT.
Given any E R choose(t with(t) = 0 int &gt; t + 1, ) C(R)
(t) = 1 int&lt;t and consider
=(t)E=F1+F2, Et
whereF1=Etfor someCRn+1),= 1 near 0. Thus F1hasc
comapct support and in fact F2 SRn. I ask you to check this last
statement as Problem L18.P1.
Anyway,
(t+ )(F1+F2) =+SRn, = 0tt.t
Now,
(t+ )(E ) = 0 =u+tu. tu
Since supp(t) tt], the second tier here is supported in tt
T. Thusu= 0 int&lt;t +T, buttis arbitrary, so u= 0.  
Notice that the assumption that uSRnis not redundant in the
statement of the Proposition, if we allow large solutions they be
come nonunique. Problem L18.P2 asks you to apply the fundamental
solution to solve the initial value problem for the heat operator.
Next we make similar use of the fundamental solution for Laplaces
operator. If n3 the
(11.44) E=Cn|x|n+2
is a fundamental solution. You should check that E n= 0 inx= 0
directly, I will show later that E n=, for the appropriate choice of
Cn, but you can do it directly, as in the case n= 3.

Solution	 18.1 (To Problem 10). (by Matja z Konvalinka).
Since the topology on N,inherited from R,is discrete, a set is com
pact if and only if it is nite. If a sequence {xn} (i.e. a function N C)
is inC0(N) if and only if for any  &gt;0 there exists a compact (hence
nite) setFso that|xn| &lt;for anynnot inF.We can assume that
F={1,...,n},which gives us the condition that {xn} is inC0(N)
if and only if it converges to 0 .We denote this space by c0,and the
supremum norm by   0.A sequence{xn} will be abbreviated to x.

1.Continuous functions 
A the beginning I want to remind you of things I think you already
know and then go on to show the direction the course will be taking.
Let me rst try to set the context.
One basic notion I assume you are reasonably familiar with is that
of a metric space ([5] p.9). This consists of a set, X,and a distance
function
d:XX=X2 [0,),
satisfying the following three	 axioms:
i)d(x,y ) = 0 x=y,(andd(x,y ) 0)
(1.1)	 ii)d(x,y ) =d(y,x) x,y X
iii)d(x,y ) d(x,z ) +d(z,y ) x,y,z X.
The basic theory of metric spaces deals with properties of subsets
(open, closed, compact, connected), sequences (convergent, Cauchy)
and maps (continuous) and the relationship between these notions.
Let me just remind you of one such result.
Proposition 1.1. A mapf:X Ybetween metric spaces is con
tinuous if and only if one of the three following equivalent conditions
holds
(1)f1(O) Xis open O Yopen.
(2)f1(C) Xis closed C Yclosed.
(3)limn f(xn) =f(x)inYifx x inX. n 
The basic example of a metric space is Euclidean space. Real n
dimensional Euclidean space, Rn, is the set of ordered ntuples of real
numbers
x= (x 1,...,xn) Rn, xj R , j= 1,...,n.
It is also the basic example of a vector (or linear) space with the oper
ations
x+y= (x 1+y1,x2+y2,...,xn+yn)
cx= (cx 1,...,cxn).
The metric is usually taken to be given by the Euclidean metric
n
2 2 2|x| = (x1++xn)1/2= (xj)1/2,
j=1

d(x,y ) =xy .| |</text>

on general Borel sets. It is nite because
(4.20)(X) = sup{u(f) ; 0f1,suppf X, fC(X)} 
u.
From Proposition 2.8 we conclude that is a Radon measure. Since
this argument applies to u we get two positive nite Radon measures
 and hence a signed Radon measure
(4.21) =+ Mn(X).
In the problems you are supposed to prove the Hahn decomposition
theorem, in particular in Problem 14 I ask you to show that (4.21) is
the Hahn decomposition of  this means that there is a Borel set
EXsuch that(E) = 0, +(X\E) = 0.
What we have dened is a linear map
(4.22) (C0(X)) M(X), u.
We want to show that this is an isomorphism, i.e., it is 1 1 and onto.
We rst show that it is 1 1. That is, suppose = 0. Given the
uniqueness of the Hahn decomposition this implies that += = 0.
So we can suppose that u0 and=+= 0 and we have to show
thatu= 0; this is obvious since
(X) = sup{u(f); suppu X,0f1fC(X)}= 0
(4.23)u(f) = 0 for all such f.
If 0 f C(X) and supp f Xthenf =f/f is of this type
sou(f) = 0 for every 0  f C(X) of compact support. From
the decomposition of continuous functions into positive and negative
parts it follows that u(f) = 0 for every fof compact support. Now, if
o(X),then given nN there exists K Xsuch thatf &lt; 1/n fC | |
onX\K.As you showed in the problems, there exists C(X) with
supp()  Xand= 1 onK.Thus iffn=fthen supp(f n) Xand
sup(ffn&lt;1/n. This shows thatC0(X) is the closure ffn=| |
of the subspace of continuous functions of compact support so by the
assumed continuity ofu, u= 0.
So it remains to show that every nite Radon measure on Xarises
from (4.22). We do this by starting from and constructing u. Again
we use the Hahn decomposition of , as in (4.21)7. Thus we assume
0 and construct u. It is obvious what we want, namely
(4.24) u(f) =fd, fCc(X).
X
7Actually we can just take any decomposition (4.21) into a dierence of positive
Radon measures.</text>

SinceEis actually bounded near innity, it follows that ESRn,
E() =E(t,x)(t,x )dxdtS(Rn+1).
t0
As before we want to compute
(11.42) (t+ )E () =E(t+ )
 
= lim E(t,x)(t+ )dxdt.
Rn E0E 
First we check that ( t+ )E = 0 int&gt;0, where it is aC function.
This is a straightforward computation:
2n xtE=2tE+| | E4t2
2xjxjE=2tE, 2E=1E+xjExj2t 4t2
2n xE=E+| | E. 2t 4t2
Now we can integrate by parts in (11.42) to get
2/4Ee|x|
(t+ )E () = lim (E,x)(4E)n/2dx.
Rn E 0
Making the same change of variables as before, X=x/2E1/2,
2 
(t+ )E() = lim (E,E1/2X)e|x|
dX.
E 0Rn n/2
AsE  0 the integral here is bounded by the integrable function
Cexp(X2), for some C &gt; 0, so by Lebesgues theorem of domi | |
nated convergence, conveys to the integral of the limit. This is
2 dx(0,0)e|x| 
n/2=(0,0).  
Rn
Thus
(t+ )E () =(0,0)(t+ )E=tx,
soEis indeed a fundamental solution. Since it vanishes in t&lt;0 it is
canned a forward fundamrntal solution.
Lets see what we can use it for.</text>

with the unit sphere we get an identication
(12.10) RnSn1Bn.
Using this identication we can, and will, regard Csp(u) and Css(u) as
21subsets of Bn.
Lemma 12.3. For anyu S(Rn),Csp(u) and Css(u)are closed
 subsets of Bnand ifC(Sn)hassupp( )Css(u) =then forR
 suciently large RuS(Rn).
Proof. Directly from the denition we know that Csp(u) Rnis closed,
as is Css(u)Rn.Thus, in each case, we need to show that if Sn1
and /Csp(u) then Csp(u) is disjoint from some neighbourhood of 
inBn.However, by denition,
U=xRn;R(x) = Sn1;() = 0} {0}{
is such a neighbourhood. Thus the fact that Csp(u) is closed follows
directly from the denition. The argument for Css( u) is essentially the
same.
The second result follows by the use of a partition of unity on Sn1.
Thus, for each point in supp( )Sn1there exists a conic localizer for
which ).By compactness we may choose a nite number of RuS(Rn
these functions jsuch that the open sets {j()&gt;0}cover supp( ).
By assumption ( j)Rj for someRj&gt;0.However this will u S(Rn)
remain true if Rjis increased, so we may suppose that Rj=Ris
independent of j.Then for function
=|j|2C(Sn1)
j
 we haveRuS(Rn).Since=for someC(Sn1) it follows
 thatR+1uS(Rn) as claimed.  
Corollary 12.4. Ifu S(Rn)then Css(u) = if and only if u 
S(Rn).
Proof. Certainly Css(u) = ifuS(Rn).IfuS(Rn) and Css(u) =
 then from Lemma 12.3,  where= 1.Thusv= Ru S(Rn)
(1R)uCc(Rn) has singsupp(v ) = sovCc(Rn) and hence
uS(Rn).

Of course the analogous result for Csp(u), that Csp(u) = if and
only ifu= 0 follows from the fact that this is true if supp( u) =.I
will treat a few other properties as selfevident. For instance
(12.11)
Csp(u )Csp(u), Css(u)Css(u)uS(Rn), S(Rn)
and
(12.12) Csp(c 1u1+c2u2)Csp(u 1)Csp(u 2),
Css(c1u1+c2u2)Css(u1)Css(u2)
u1,u2S(Rn), c 1,c2C.
One useful consequence of having the cone support at our disposal
is that we can discuss sucient conditions to allow us to multiply dis
tributions; we will get better conditions below using the same idea but
applied to the wavefront set but this preliminary discussion is usedthere. In general the product of two distributions is not dened, and
indeed not denable, as a distribution. However, we can always multi
ply an element of
S(Rn) and an element of S(Rn).
To try to understand multiplication look at the question of pairing
between two distributions.
Lemma 12.5. IfKi Bn, i= 1,2,are two disjoint closed (hence
compact) subsets then we can dene an unambiguous pairing
(12.13)
(Rn); Css(u)K1}{(Rn); Css(u)K2}(u1,u2) {uS uS
u1(u2)C.
Proof. To dene the pairing, choose a function C(Sn1) which is
identically equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of K1Sn1and with support
disjoint from K2Sn1.Then extend it to be homogeneous, as above,
and cut o to get R.IfRis large enough Csp( R) is disjoint from K2.
ThenR+ (1)R= 1 +whereC(Rn).We can nd anotherc
functionC(Rn) such that 1=R+= 1 in a neighbourhood ofc
K1and with Csp( 1) disjoint from K2.Once we have this, for u1and
u2as in (12.13),
(12.14) 1u2S(Rn) and (11)u1S(Rn)
since in both cases Css is empty from the denition. Thus we can dene
the desired pairing between u1andu2by
(12.15) u1(u2) =u1(1u2) +u2((11)u1).</text>

Proof. ThatC1 is a norm follows from the properties of . Namely

inequality follows from the same inequality for .
Similarly, the main part of the completeness of C1

0(Rn)follows from
1
0 (Rn). If{

thenunun} is a Cauchy sequence in C
). It follows that there are0
0(Rnunand thexj
limits of these sequences,
un 0
0(Rn). vjC unv,xj
However we do have to check that vis continuously dierentiable and
thatv=vj.xj
One way to do this is to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
in each variable. Thus
tunun(x+tei) = (x +sei)ds+un(x).xj 0
Asn all terms converge and so, by the continuity of the integral,
t
u(x+tei) =vj(x+sei)ds+u(x).
0
This shows that the limit in (6.6) exists, so vi(x) is the partial deriva
tion ofuwith respect to xi.It remains only to show that uis indeed
dierentiable at each point and I leave this to you in Problem 17.
So, almost by denition, we have an example of Lemma 6.1,
1
0(Rn)C0
0(Rn).C
It is in fact dense but I will not bother showing this (yet). So we know
that
0
0(Rn)) (C1
0(Rn))(C
and we expect it to be injective. Thus there are more functionals on
1
0(Rn) including things that are more singular than measures.
An example is related to the Dirac delta

0(Rn), (x)(u) =u(x), uC
namely

This is clearly a continuous linear functional which it is only just todenote

10.Sobolev embedding 
The properties of Sobolev spaces are briey discussed above. If m
is a positive integer then u Hm(Rn) means that uhas up tom
derivatives in L2(Rn).The question naturally arises as to the sense
in which these weak derivatives correspond to oldfashioned strong
derivatives. Of course when mis not an integer it is a little harder
to imagine what these fractional derivatives are. However the main
result is:
Theorem 10.1 (Sobolev embedding). IfuHm(Rn)wherem&gt;n/2
0thenuC0(Rn), i.e.,
m(Rn(10.1)	 H )C00(Rn), m&gt;n/ 2.
Proof. By denition, uHm(Rn) means(Rn) andm()u vS

shows that

Now, ifm &gt; n/2 then the second integral is nite. Since the rst
integral is the norm on Hm(Rn) we see that
(10.2) supu(x)|=uL (2)nuHm, m&gt;n/2.
Rn|    
This is all for u S(Rn), butS(Rn) Hm(Rn) is dense. The
estimate (10.2) shows that if uj uinHm(Rn),withuj S(Rn),
0then	 inC0(Rn).In factu =uinS(Rn) since uin
j0(Rn) both imply thatu u u j

Notice here the precise meaning of u=u, uHm(Rn)L2(Rn),
0u  C0(Rn).When identifying u L2(Rn) with the corresponding
tempered distribution, the values on any set of measure zero are lost.
Thus as functions (10.1) means that each uHm(Rn) has a represen
0tativeu C0(Rn).
We can extend this to higher derivatives by noting that</text>

3.Measureability of functions 
Suppose thatMis aalgebra on a set X4andN is aalgebra on
another set Y.A mapf:XYis said to be measurable with respect
to these given algebras on XandYif
(3.1) f1(E)MEN.
Notice how similar this is to one of the characterizations of continuity
for maps between metric spaces in terms of open sets. Indeed this
analogy yields a useful result.
Lemma 3.1. IfGN generatesN,in the sense that
(3.2) =;N G,N aalgebra} N {N
thenf:XYis measurable i f1(A)M for allAG.
Proof. The main point to note here is that f1as a map on power
sets, is very well behaved for any map. That is if f:X Y then
satises: f1:P(Y)P (X) 
f1(EC) = (f1(E))C
&#13;
 &#13;
 
f1Ej=f1(Ej)
(3.3)j=1 j=1
 
f1Ej=f1(Ej)
j=1 j=1
f1() =, f1(Y) =X.
Putting these things together one sees that if M is anyalgebra on
Xthen
(3.4) f(M) =EY;f1(E)M 
is always a algebra on Y.
In particular if f1(A)M for allAGN thenf(M) is a
algebra containing G,hence containingN by the generating condition.
Thusf1(E)M for allEN sofis measurable.  
Proposition 3.2. Any continuous map f:X Y between metric
spaces is measurable with respect to the Borel algebras on XandY.
4Then X,or if you want to be pedantic (X, M),is often said to be a measure
space or even a measurable space.</text>

for instance over the unit cube [0, 1]n:
u(f) =f(x)dx.
[0,1]n
In some sense we must show that allcontinuous linear functionals
on 0(X) are given by integration. However, we have to interpretC
integration somewhat widely since there are also evaluation functionals.
IfzXconsider the Dirac delta
z(f) =f(z).
This is also called a point mass ofz. So we need a theory of measure
and integration wide enough to include both of these cases.
One special feature of C0(X), compared to general normed spaces, is
that there is a notion of positivity for its elements. Thus f 0 just
meansf(x)0xX.
Lemma 1.4. EachfC 0(X)can be decomposed uniquely as the dif
ference of its positive and negative parts
(1.6) f=f+f , f C 0(X), f(x f (x)| xX. )|
Proof. Simply dene
f(x) =f(x) iff(x)0
0 iff(x)&lt;0
for the same sign throughout. Then (1.6) holds. Observe that f+is
continuous at each yXsince, with Uan appropriate neighborhood
ofy, in each case
f(y)&gt;0 =f(x)&gt;0 forxU=f+=finU
f(y)&lt;0 =f(x)&lt;0 forxU=f+= 0 inU
f(y) = 0 = given&gt;0Us.t.f(x)|&lt;inU|
=f+(x)|&lt;inU.|
Thusf=ff 0(X), since both f+andf vanish at innity.   +C
We can similarly split elements of the dual space into positive and
negative parts although it is a little bit more delicate. We say that
0(X)) is positive if u(C
(1.7) u(f)00fC 0(X).
For a general (real) u(C0(X)) and for each 0fC 0(X) set

I will remind you of the proof later.
First however I want to discuss the important notion of ellipticity.
Remember that P(D) is really just a polynomial, called the charac
teristic polynomial 
P() =C.
||m
It has the property
P(D)u() =P()(Rn). u()uS
This shows (if it isnt already obvious) that we can remove P() from
P(D) thought of as an operator on S(Rn).
We can think of invertingP(D) by dividing by P(). This works
well provided P() = 0, for all Rn. An example of this is
n
P() =|| 2+ 1 = +1 .
j=1
nHowever even the Laplacian,  =j=1Dj2, does not satisfy this rather
stringent condition.
It is reasonable to expect the top order derivatives to be the most
important. We therefore consider
Pm() =C
|=m|
the leading part, or principal symbol, of P(D).
Denition 11.11. A polynomial P(), orP(D), is said to be elliptic
of ordermprovidedPm() = 0 for all 0 =Rn.
So what I want to show today is
Theorem 11.12. Every elliptic dierential operator P(D)is hypoel
liptic.
We want to nd a parametrix forP(D); we already know that we
might as well suppose that Fhas compact support. Taking the Fourier
transform of (11.27) we see that Fshould satisfy
(11.28) P()F() = 1 +, S(Rn).
Here we use the fact that C(Rn), soS(Rn) too.c )S(Rn

So what is the constant? To nd it we need to work out an example.

(8.30) and (8.31) its Fourier transform satises

7.Tempered distributions 
A good rst reference for distributions is [2], [4] gives a more exhaus
tive treatment.
The complete metric topology on S(Rn) is described above. Next I
want to try to convice you that elements of its dual space S(Rn),have
enough of the properties of functions that we can work with them as
generalized functions.
First let me develop some notation. A dierentiable function :
RnC has partial derivatives which we have denoted /xj:Rn	 
C.For reasons that will become clear later, we put a1 into the
denition	 and write
1(7.1)	 Dj=.ixj
We sayis once continuously dierentiable if each of these Djis
continuous. Then we dened ktimes continuous dierentiability in
ductively by saying that and theDjare (k1)times continuously
dierentiable. For k= 2 this means that
DjDkare continuous for j,k=1, ,n.
Now, recall that, if continuous, these second derivatives are symmetric:
(7.2)	 DjDk=DkDj.
This means we can use a compact notation for higher derivatives. Put
N0={0,1,...}; we call an element  Nna multiindex and if is0
at leastktimes continuously dierentiable, we set12
1 n 1(7.3)D=i|| x1 xnwhenever= +n k. | | 1+2+
Now we have dened the spaces.
k	 0(7.4)C0(Rn) =:Rn C ;D C0(Rn)  .| | k
Notice the convention is that Dis asserted to exist if it is required
to be continuous! Using x = (1 +x2) we dened| | 
k(7.5)xkC0(Rn) =:Rn	
0k(Rn),  C ;xk C
and then our space of test functions is
kS(Rn) =xkC0(Rn).
k

is a metric on any normed space, since then we may sum over k.Thus
we consider
u v +v w 
1 +u v 1 +v w 
u v(1 +v w) +v w(1 +u v)= .(1 +u v)(1 +v w)
Comparing this to d(v,w ) we must show that
(1 +u v)(1 +v w)u w 
 (u v(1 +v w) +v w(1 +u v))(1 +u w).
Starting from the LHS and using the triangle inequality,
LHS u w + (u v +v w +u vv w)u w
 (u v +v w +u vv w)(1 +u w)
 RHS.
Thus,dis a metric.

td(x)(0) = (tx)dtdt0(8.27) n t =xj (tx)dt.xjj=10
Certainly these integrals are C, but they may not decay rapidly at

Since (1)is of the form (8.26), this proves (8.25).
Our assumption on uis thatxju= 0, thus
u() = 0H 
by (8.25). Choosing as above, a general S(Rn) can be written

Problem 36. For the moment let me assume that this convolution has
the same properties as before  I ask you to check the main parts of
this in Problem 37.
Recall that ES(Rn) is a fundamental situation for P(D), a con
stant coecient dierential operator, if P(D)E=. We also use a
weaker notion.
Denition 11.8. Aparametrix for a constant coecient dierential
operatorP(D)is a distribution FS(Rn)such that
(11.20) P(D)F=+, C(Rn).
An operator P(D)is said to be hypoelliptic if it has a parametrix sat
isfying
(11.21) sing supp(F ){0},
where for any uS(Rn)
(11.22) (sing supp(u)) =xRn(Rn),c{ ;C
(x) = 0,uC(Rn)}.c
Since the same must work for nearby points in (11.22), the set
sing supp(u) is closed. Furthermore
(11.23) sing supp(u)supp(u).
As Problem 37 I ask you to show that if K RnandKsing supp(u) =

Theorem 11.9. IfP(D)is hypoelliptic then
(11.25) sing supp(u) = sing supp(P (D)u)uS(Rn).
Proof. One half of this is true for anydierential operator:

Proof. Since convolution u=Ef SRnCRnis dened we
certainly get a solution to u =fthis way. We need to check that
Rn. First we know that  is hypoelliptic so we can decompose0uC
E=F1+F2, F 1SRn,suppF, Rn
and thenF . In fact we can see from (11.44) that 2CRn

Now,F1fSRn, as we showed before, and continuing the integral
we see that
Du +CN(1 +|x|)NN | ||DF2f|

Sincen&gt;2 it follows that0Rn.uC
So only the uniqueness remains. If there are two solutions, u1,u2for
a givenfthenv=u1uRnsatises v = 0. Since Rn

we can take the Fourier transform and see that
v() = 0supp(v || 2){0}.
 an earlier problem was to conclude from this that v=CD||m
for some constants C. This in turn implies that vis a polynomial.
However the only polynomials in C0Rnare identically 0. Thus v= 00

It is not immediately apparent that this space is nonempty (well 0
is in there but...); that
2exp(x )| | )S(Rn
is Problem 19. There are lots of other functions in there as we shall
see.
Schwartz idea is that the dual of S(Rn) should contain all the in
teresting objects, at least those of polynomial growth. The problemis that we do nothave a good norm on
S(Rn).Rather we have a lotof
them. Observe that

Thus we see that as a linear space

Since these spaces are getting smaller, we have a countably innitenumber of norms. For this reason
S(Rn) is called a countably normed
space.
Proposition 6.7. ForuS(Rn), set

(6.12) d(u,v ) =

1 +uv(k),
thendis a distance function in S(Rn)with respect to which it is a
complete metric space.
Proof. The series in (6.12) certainly converges, since
uv(k)1.1 +uv(k)
The rst two conditions on a metric are clear,
d(u,v ) = 0 = 0u=v, uvC0 
and symmetry is immediate. The triangle inequality is perhaps moremysterious!
Certainly it is enough to show that

Thus we have (12.45) in the forward direction.
For reverse implication it follows directly that (p,q )/WF sc(u1) and
that (p,q)/WF sc(u2).	  
This restatement of the denition makes it clear that there a high
degree of symmetry under the Fourier transform
Corollary 12.17. For anyuS(Rn),
(12.47)	 (p,q)WF sc(u)) (q,p)WF sc(u).
Proof. I suppose a corollary should not need a proof, but still . . . .The
statement (12.47) is equivalent to
WF sc(u)) =(q,p)/ u) (12.48) (p,q)/	 WF sc(
since the reverse is the same by Fourier inversion. By (12.45) the
condition on the left is equivalent to u=u1+u2withp / Css(u1),
q /Css(u2).Hence equivalent to
(12.49) u=v1+v2, v1=u2, v2= (2 )nu1
Css(v1),p / soq /Css(v2) which proves (12.47).  
Now, we can exploit these notions to rene our conditions under
which pairing, the product and convolution can be dened.
Theorem 12.18. Foru, vS(Rn)
(12.50)	uvS(Rn)is unambiguously dened provided
(p,)WF sc(u)(BnSn1) =(p,)/WF sc(v)
and
(12.51)	uvS(Rn)is unambiguously dened provided
(,q)WF sc(u)(Sn1Bn) =(,q)/WF sc(v).
Proof. Let us consider convolution rst. The hypothesis, (12.51) means
that for each Sn1
(12.52)
{qBn1; (,q)WF sc(u)}{qBn1; (,q)WF sc(v)}=.
Now, the fact that WF scis always a closed set means that (12.52)
remains true near in the sense that if USn1is a suciently small

If comes from an inner product, then it must satisfy the polari
sation identity:
2(x,y) = 1/4(x+y2x+iy2xiy2) xy i  i
i.e, the inner product is recoverable from the norm, so use the RHS
(right hand side) to dene an inner product on the vector space. Youwill need the paralellogram law to verify the additivity of the RHS.
Note the polarization identity is a bit more transparent for real vector
spaces. There we have

Next I want to return to our starting point and discuss the Riesz
representation theorem. There are two important results in measure
theory that I have not covered  I will get you to do most of them
in the problems  namely the Hahn decomposition theorem and the
RadonNikodym theorem. For the moment we can do without the
latter, but I will use the former.
So, consider a locally compact metric space, X. By a Borel measure
onX, or a signed Borel measure, we shall mean a function on Borel
sets
:B (X) R 
which is given as the dierence of two nite positive Borel measures
(4.16) (E) =1(E) 2(E).
Similarly we shall say that is Radon, or a signed Radon measure, if
itcan be written as such a dierence, with both 1and2nite Radon
measures. See the problems below for a discussion of this point.
LetMn(X) denote the set of nite Radon measures on X. This is
a normed space with
(4.17)   1= inf( 1(X) +2(X))
with the inmum over all Radon decompositions (4.16). Each signed
Radon measure denes a continuous linear functional on C 0(X):
(4.18)  d:C 0(X) f 
Xf d.
Theorem 4.12 (Riesz representation.). IfXis a locally compact met
ric space then every continuous linear functional on C 0(X)is given by
a unique nite Radon measure on Xthrough (4.18) .
Thus the dual space of C 0(X)isMn(X)  at least this is how such
a result is usually interpreted
(4.19) (C 0(X)) =Mn(X),
see the remarks following the proof.
Proof. We have done half of this already. Let me remind you of the
steps.
We started with u (C 0(X)) and showed that u=u+ u where
u arepositive continuous linear functionals; this is Lemma 1.5. Then
we showed that u 0 denes a nite positive Radon measure . Here
is dened by (1.11) on open sets and (E) =(E) is given by (1.12)</text>

Lemma 11.7. IfvS(Rn)has compact support and S(Rn)then

v(x) = (v )(x) =v(y),(xy)y

The fundamental fact about a Hilbert space is that each element
v Hdenes a continuous linear functional by
H u (u,v) C 
and conversely every continuous linear functional arises this way. This
is also called the Riesz representation theorem.
Proposition 5.3. IfL:HC is a continuous linear functional on
a Hilbert space then this is a unique element v Hsuch that
(5.9) Lu= (u,v ) u H,
Proof. Consider the linear space
M={u H;Lu= 0} 
the null space of L,a continuous linear functional on H. By the as
sumed continuity, Mis closed. We can suppose that Lisnotidentically
zero (since then v= 0 in (5.9)). Thus there exists w / Consider M.
w+M={v H;v=w+u, u M} .
This is a closed convex subset of H. Applying Lemma 5.2 it has a
unique smallest element, v w+M. Sincevminimizes the norm on
w+M,
2 2 2v+su= + 2 Re(su,v ) +s2v u
is stationary at s= 0. Thus Re(u,v ) = 0 u M, and the same
argument with sreplaced by isshows that (v,u) = 0  u M.
Nowv w+M, soLv=Lw= 0. Consider the element w =
w/Lw H. SinceLw = 1, for any u H
L(u (Lu)w) =Lu Lu= 0.
2It follows that u (Lu)w  Mso ifw =w/w
(w,w)(u,w) = ((Lu)w,w) =Lu =Lu.w2
The uniqueness of vfollows from the positivity of the norm.  
Corollary 5.4. For any positive measure ,any continuous linear
functional
L:L2(X,) C 
is of the form

Proof. The set dened by (7.19) is closed, since
(7.20) supp(u) ={pRn), (p) = 0, u = 0} ;S(Rn
is clearly open  the same works for nearby points. If  S(Rn)
we deneuS(Rn),which we will again identify with , by
(7.21) u() =(x) (x)dx.
Obviouslyu= 0 == 0, simply set =in (7.21). Thus the
map
(7.22) S(Rn (Rn) )uS
is injective. We want to show that
(7.23) supp(u) = supp( )
on the left given by (7.19) and on the right by (7.18). We show rst
that
supp(u)supp( ).
Thus, we need to see that p /  supp(u).The rst  supp( ) p /
condition is that (x) = 0 in a neighbourhood, Uofp, hence there
is aC functionwith support in Uand(p) = 0.Then 0.
Conversely suppose p / supp(u).Then there exists  S(Rn) with
(p) = 0 and u= 0, i.e.,u() = 0S(Rn).By the injectivity
ofS(Rn)(Rn) this means = 0, so0 in a neighborhood of S
pandp /supp( ).  
Consider the simplest examples of distribution which are not func
tions, namely those with support at a given point p.The obvious one
is the Dirac delta function
(7.24) p() =(p)S(Rn).
We can make many more, because Dislocal
(7.25) supp(Du)supp(u)uS(Rn).
Indeed,p /supp(u)S(Rn), u0, (p) = 0. Thus each of
the distributions Dpalso has support contained in {p}.In fact none
of them vanish, and they are all linearly independent.</text>

IfVis a normed linear space we are particularly interested in the
continuous linear functionals on V. Here functional just means func

for historical reasons.
Proposition 1.3. The following are equivalent conditions on a linear

(2)uis continuous at 0.
(3){u(f)R ;fV ,f1}is bounded.
(4)C s.t. u(f ) . | |CffV
Proof. (1) = (2) by denition. Then (2) implies that u1(1,1) is
a neighborhood of 0  V, so for some  &gt;0,u({fV;f&lt;})
(1,1). By linearity of u,u({fV;f&lt;1})(
so (2) =(3).Then (3) implies that
u(f)|CfV,f1 |
for someC. Again using linearity of u, iff= 0,
fu(f)|fu|fCf,
giving (4). Finally, assuming (4),1)is bounded,1,
u(f)u(g) =u(fg) | | | | Cfg 
shows that uis continuous at any point gV.  
In view of this identication, continuous linear functionals are often
said to be bounded. One of the important ideas that we shall exploit
later is that of duality. In particular this suggests that it is a good
idea to examine the totality of bounded linear functionals on V. The
dual space is
V =V =u:VK ,linear and bounded }. {
This is also a normed linear space where the linear operations are
(u+v)(f) =u(f) +v(f)(1.4)(cu)(f) =c(u(f ))fV.</text>

The basic estimate leading to the spectral theorem is:
Proposition 16.3. IfAis a bounded selfadjoint operator and pis a
real polynomial in one variable,
N
(16.14)	 p(t) =citi, cN= 0,
i=0
N
thenp(A) =ciAisatises
i=0
(16.15)	 supp(t)|. p(A) 
t[m,M ]|
Proof. Clearly,p(A) is a bounded selfadjoint operator. If s /p([m,M ])
thenp(A)sis invertible. Indeed, the roots of p(t)smust cannot
lie in [m.M ],since otherwise sp([m,M ]).Thus, factorizing p(s)t
we have
(16.16)
N
p(t)s=cN (tti(s)), ti(s)/[m,M ] =(p(A)s)1exists 
i=1
sincep(A) =cN(Ati(s)) and each of the factors is invertible.
i
Thus spec(p(A))  p([m,M ]),which is an interval (or a point), and
from Proposition 16.3 we conclude that p(A)supp([m,M ]) which
is (16.15).  
Now, reinterpreting (16.15) we have a linear map
(16.17)	 P(R)pp(A)B(H)
from the real polynomials to the bounded selfadjoint operators which
is continuous with respect to the supremum norm on [m,M ].Since
polynomials are dense in continuous functions on nite intervals, wesee that (16.17) extends by continuity to a linear map
(16.18)
C([m,M ])ff(A)B(H),f(A)f[m,M ], fg(A) =f(A)g(A)
where the multiplicativity follows by continuity together with the fact
that it is true for polynomials.
Now, consider any two elements ,H.Evaluating f(A) onand
pairing with gives a linear map
(16.19) C([m,M ])ff(A),C.
This is a linear functional on C([m,M ]) to which we can apply the Riesz
representatin theorem and conclude that it is dened by integration</text>

Now that we have considered the Fourier transform of Schwartz test
functions we can use the usual method, of duality, to extend it to
  tempered distributions. If we set =then=and=G=G
so
(x) = (2)neix()d
eix= (2 )n ()d= (2 )n(x).
Substituting in (9.5) we nd that
dx =d.  
Now, recalling how we embed S(Rn)S(Rn) we see that

Proposition 9.6. The denition (9.7) gives an isomorphism

satisfying the identities
 xu(9.12) Du=u,= (1)| |Du.
Proof. Since u=uF andG is the 2sided inverse of F,
(9.13) u= uG

12.Cone support and wavefront set 
In discussing the singular support of a tempered distibution above,
notice that
singsupp(u) = 
only implies that uC(Rn),not as one might want, that uS(Rn).
We can however rene the concept of singular support a little to get
this.
Let us think of the sphere Sn1as the set of asymptotic directions in
Rn.That is, we identify a point in Sn1with a halfline{ax;a(0,)}
for 0 = xRn.Since two points give the same halfline if and only if
they are positive multiples of each other, this means we think of the
sphere as the quotient
(12.1) Sn1= (Rn\{0})/R+.
Of course if we have a metric on Rn,for instance the usual Euclidean
metric, then we can identify Sn1with the unit sphere. However (12.1)
does not require a choice of metric.
Now, suppose we consider functions on Rn\{0}which are (positively)
x) =f( homogeneous of degree 0 .That isf(ax),for alla &gt; 0,and
they are just functions on Sn1.Smooth functions on Sn1correspond
(if you like by denition) with smooth functions on Rn\{0}which are
homogeneous of degree 0. Let us take such a function C(Rn\{0}),
(ax) =(x) for alla&gt;0.Now, to make this smooth on Rnwe need
to cut it o near 0 .So choose a cuto function  C(Rn),withc
(x) = 1 in|x|&lt;1.Then
(12.2) R(x) =(x)(1(x/R ))C(Rn),
for anyR &gt; 0.This function is supported in x R.Now, ifhas | |
support near some point Sn1then forRlarge the corresponding
functionRwill localize near as a point at innity of Rn. Rather
than try to understand this directly, let us consider a corresponding
analytic construction.
First of all, a function of the form Ris a multiplier on S(Rn).That
is,
(12.3) R:S(Rn). )S (Rn
To see this, the main problem is to estimate the derivatives at innity,since the product of smooth functions is smooth. This in turn amounts
to estimating the deriviatives of inx

16.Spectral theorem 
For a bounded operator Ton a Hilbert space we dene the spectrum
as the set
(16.1) spec(T ) =zC;TzId is not invertible }. {
Proposition 16.1. For any bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space
spec(T)C is a compact subset of {|z .|T}
Proof. We show that the set C \spec(T) (generally called the resolvent
set ofT) is open and contains the complement of a suciently large
ball. This is based on the convergence of the Neumann series. Namely
ifTis bounded andT&lt;1 then

(16.2) (IdT)1=Tj
j=0
converges to a bounded operator which is a twosided inverse of Id T.
Indeed,Tj  Tjso the series is convergent and composing with
IdTon either side gives a telescoping series reducing to the identity.
Applying this result, we rst see that
(16.3) (Tz) =z(IdT/z)
is invertible if z &gt;T.Similarly, if (Tz0)1exists for some z0C ||
then
(16.4) (Tz) = (Tz0)(zz0) = (Tz0)1(Id(zz0)(Tz0)1)
exists for &lt;1.  |zz0|(Tz0)1
In general it is rather dicult to precisely locate spec(T ).
However for a bounded selfadjoint operator it is easier. One sign of
this is the the norm of the operator has an alternative, simple, characterization. Namely
(16.5) ifA =Athen supA,|=.A
=1
Ifais this supermum, then clearly aA.To see the converse, choose
any,  Hwith norm 1 and then replace byeiwithchosen
so thatA, is real. Then use the polarization identity to write
(16.6) 4A,=A(+),(+)A(),() 
+iA(+i),(+i)iA(i),(i).
Now, by the assumed reality we may drop the last two terms and seethat
2(16.7) 4|A,|a(+2+) = 2a(2+2) = 4a.</text>

4.Integration 
The ()integral of a nonnegative simple function is by denition
(4.1) fd =ai(YEi), YM.
Yi
Here the convention is that if (YEi) =butai= 0 thenai(Y
Ei) = 0. Clearly this integral takes values in [0, ]. More signicantly,
ifc0 is a constant and fandgare two nonnegative (measurable)
simple functions then
cfd =c fd
 Y Y 
(4.2) (f+g)d=fd+gd
Y Y Y
fd gd. 0fg 
Y Y
(See [1] Proposition 2.13 on page 48.)
To see this, observe that (4.1) holds for anypresentation (3.5) of f
with allai0. Indeed, by restriction to Eiand division by ai(which
can be assumed nonzero) it is enough to consider the special case
E=bjFj.
j
TheFjcan always be written as the union of a nite number, N,
of disjoint measurable sets, Fj=lSjGlwherej= 1,...,N and 
Sj{1,...,N.Thus}
bj(Fj) =bj(Gl) =(E)
j jlSj
since{j;lSj} bj= 1 for each j.
From this all the statements follow easily.

It also has the middle property, but this is less obvious. To see this, we
shall prove the basic Monotone convergence theorem (of Lebesgue).

The elements ofMwith measure zero, i.e., , (E) = 0, are EM
supposed to be ignorable. The measure is said to be complete if
(2.5)EXandFM, (F ) = 0, EF .EM
See Problem 4.
The rst part of the following important result due to Caratheodory
was shown above.
Theorem 2.4. If is an outer measure on Xthen the collection of
measurable subsets of Xis aalgebra and  restricted toMis a
complete measure.
Proof. We have already shown that the collection of measurable
subsets of Xis aalgebra. To see the second part, observe that
takingA=Fin (2.2) gives

(F) =(Ej) ifF=Ej
j j=1
and theEjare disjoint elements of M. This is (2.4).
Similarly if (E) = 0 andFEthen(F) = 0. Thus it is enough
to show that for any subset EX, (E) = 0 implies EM . For
anyAX,using the fact that (AE) = 0,and the increasing
property of  
C(A)(AE) +(AE)
C=(AE)(A)
shows that these must always be equalities, so E M (i.e., is
measurable).  
Going back to our primary concern, recall that we constructed the
outer measure  from 0u(C0(X)) using (1.11) and (1.12). For
the measure whose existence follows from Caratheodorys theorem to
be much use we need
Proposition 2.5. If0u(C0(X)), forXa locally compact met
ric space, then each open subset of Xismeasurable for the outer
measure dened by (1.11) and(1.12) andin(1.11) is its measure.
Proof. LetUXbe open. We only need to prove (2.1) for all AX

One can also give a similar discussion of the convolution of two tem
pered distributions. Once again we do not have a denition of uvas a
tempered distribution for all u,vS(Rn).We do know how to dene
the convolution if either uorvis compactly supported, or if either is
inS(Rn).This leads directly to
Lemma 12.6. IfCss(u)Sn1=thenuvis dened unambiguously
by
x(12.21) uv=u1v+u , u 1= (1( ))u, u 2=uu1 2vr
whereC(Rn)has(x) = 1 inx1andRis suciently large;c
there is a similar denition if Css(v)|

Proof. Since Css(u)Sn1=,we know that Css(u 1) =ifRis large 
enough, so then both terms on the right in (12.21) are welldened. To
see that the result is independent of Rjust observe that the dierence
of the righthand side for two values of Ris of the form wvwv
withwcompactly supported.  
Now, we can go even further using a slightly more sophisticated
decomposition based on
Lemma 12.7. IfuS(Rn)andCss(u) = where Sn1is a

Ify Rnand S(Rn) set(x) =(x+y). The translation
invariance of Lebesgue measure shows that
eix() =(x+y)dx
iy =e ( ).
Applied to the inversion formula (9.1) becomes
(9.2) (y) =(0) = (2 )n()d
iy = (2 )ne ( )d.

Theorem 9.1. Fourier transform F :S(Rn)S (Rn)is an isomor
phism with inverse
(9.3)G:S(Rn),G(y) = (2)neiy()d. )S(Rn
Proof. The identity (9.2) shows that F is 11, i.e., injective, since we
 can remove from. Moreover,
(9.4) G(y) = (2)nF(y)
SoG is also a continuous linear map, G :S(Rn) S(Rn). Indeed
the argument above shows that GF =Idand the same argument,
with some changes of sign, shows that FG =Id. ThusFandG are
isomorphisms.
Lemma 9.2. For all,S(Rn), Pasevals identity holds:

Proof. We already know that uis smooth, so Css( u)Sn1.Thus,
Css(u) then / we need to show that if Sn1and / Css(u).
Fix such a point Sn1\Css(u) and take a closed set  Sn1
which is a neighbourhood of but which is still disjoint from Css(u) and
then apply Lemma 12.7. The two terms u2,whereu2S(Rn) and
1whereu(Rn) are both inS(Rn) so we can assume that u u

subset  1Sn1which is still a neighbourhood of but which does
not meet  2,which is the closure of the complement of  .If we replace
these iby the closed cones of which they are the crosssections then
we are in the situation of (12.23) and (12.23), except for the signs.
That is, there is a constant c&gt;0 such that

open, so given  &gt;0 there exists f C(X) supp(f ) AUwith

Now,A\supp(f ) is also open, so we can nd g C(X),0 g

SinceP(X) is always a algebra it follows that for any collection
E P(X) there is always a smallest algebra containing E, namely

The elements of the smallest algebra containing the open sets are
called Borel sets. A measure dened on the algebra of all Borel sets

Hint: Problem 70 shows that (17.26) holds for each u L2(Rn); check
that (17.27) also holds for each function. Then use a covering argument
to prove that both these conditions must hold for a compact subset of
L2(R) and hence for a precompact set. One method to prove the con
verse is to show that if (17.26) and (17.27) hold then Bis bounded

bly using Problem 71, that if Ris cuto to a ball of radius Rthen

Proof. We need to show that p / sing supp(u) sing supp(f ) then
p /sing supp(uf).Once we can x p,we might as well suppose that
fhas compact support too. Indeed, choose a large ball B(R,0) so that
B(0,R)p / z /supp(u) +B(0,R).
This is possible by the assumed boundedness of supp(u). Then choose
(Rn) with= 1 onB(0,R); it follows from Theorem L16.2, orcC
rather its extension to distributions, that  /supp(u(1)f), so we
can replace fbyf, noting that sing supp(f )sing supp(f ). Now if
fhas compact support we can choose compact neighbourhoods K1,K2
of sing supp(u) and sing supp( f) such that p /K1+K2. Furthermore
we an decompose u=u1+u2,f=f1+f2so that supp(u 1) K1,
supp(f 2)K2andu2,f2C(Rn). It follows that
=u1f1+u2f2+u1f2+u2f2. uf
Now,p /supp(u 1f1), by the support property of convolution and the
three other terms are C, since at least one of the factors is C. Thus
p /sing supp(uf).

The compactness of Sn1means that there is a nite cover of Sn1by
such setsUj.Now select a partition of unity iofSn1which is not
only subordinate to this open cover, so each iis supported in one of
theUjbut satises the additional condition that
(12.54) supp(i) ( supp(i)) = =  
supp(i) ( supp(i)) Ujfor somej.
Now, if we set ui= (i)Ru,andvi= (i)Rv,we know that u ui
i
has compact support and similarly for v.Since convolution is already
known to be possible if (at least) one factor has compact support, it
suces to dene ui vi for everyi,i.So, rst suppose that supp( i)
( supp(i)) =.In this case we conclude from (12.54) that
(12.55) Css(ui) Css(vi ) =.
Thus we may dene

independent of choices made in the decomposition. I leave this to you.

Of course we should check that this denition is independent of the
cuto function used in it. However, if we go through the denition and
choose a dierent function  to start with, extend it homogeneoulsy
and cut o (probably at a dierent R) and then nd a correction term
 then the 1parameter linear homotopy between them
(12.16) 1(t) =t1+ (1t)1, t[0,1]
satises all the conditions required of 1in formula (12.14). Thus in
fact we get a smooth family of pairings, which we can write for the
moment as
(12.17) (u1,u2)t=u1(1(t)u2) +u2((11(t))u 1).
By inspection, this is an anelinear function of twith derivative
(12.18) u1(( 11)u2) +u2((11))u 1).
Now, we just have to justify moving the smooth function in (12.18) tosee that this gives zero. This should be possible since Csp( 
is11)
disjoint from bothK1andK2.
In fact, to be very careful for once, we should construct another
functionin the same way as we constructed 1to be homogenous
near innity and smooth and such that Csp( ) is also disjoint from both
K1andK2but= 1 on Csp(11).Then(

we can insert it in (12.18) and justify

Here the second equality is just the identity for as a (multiplica

Once we have dened the pairing between tempered distibutions with
disjoint conic singular supports, in the sense of (12.14), (12.15), we can
dene the product under the same conditions. Namely to dene the
product of say u1andu2we simply set
(12.20)u1u2() =u1(u 2) =u2(u 1)S(Rn),
provided Css( u1)Css(u2) =.
Indeed, this would be true if one of u1oru2was itself inS(Rn) and
makes sense in general. I leave it to you to check the continuity statement required to prove that the product is actually a tempered disti
bution (Problem 78).</text>

Let us abstract this immediately to the notion of a normed vector
space, or normed space. This is a vector space V(overR orC) equipped
with a norm, which is to say a function
[0,):V
satisfying
i)v= 0v= 0,
(1.2) ii)cv=c||vcK,
iii)v+ .v+w w
This means that (V,d), d(v,w ) =vwis a vector space; I am also
usingK to denote either R orC as is appropriate.
The case of a nite dimensional normed space is not very interesting
because, apart from the dimension, they are all the same. We shall
say (in general) that two norms  2onVareequivalent 1and
of there exists C &gt; 0 such that
1. vv2Cv1vVC 1
Proposition 1.2. Any two norms on a nite dimensional vector space
are equivalent.
So, we are mainly interested in the innite dimensional case. I will
start the course, in a slightly unorthodox manner, by concentrating on
one such normed space (really one class). Let Xbe a metric space.
The case of a continuous function, f:XR (orC) is a special case
of Proposition 1.1 above. We then dene
C(X) ={f:XR, f bounded and continuous }.
In fact the same notation is generally used for the space of complex
valued functions. If we want to distinguish between these two possibilities we can use the more pedantic notation C(X;R) andC(X;C).
Now, the obvious norm on this linear space is the supremum (or uniform) norm
= supf(x)|. f 
xX|
HereXis an arbitrary metric space. For the moment Xis sup
posed to be a physical space, something like Rn. Corresponding to
the nitedimensionality of Rnwe often assume (or demand) that X
islocally compact. This just means that every point has a compact
neighborhood, i.e., is in the interior of a compact set. Whether locally</text>

Thus indeedA= sup==1|A,|=a.
We can always subtract a real constant from Aso thatA =At

Then, it follows that A A is not invertible. Indeed, there exists a

This shows that A cannot be invertible and the same argumentA
works forA +A.For the original operator Aif we set
inf (16.10) m=

then we conclude that neither AmId norAMId is invertible and
max(m,M ). A=
Proposition 16.2. IfAis a bounded selfadjoint operator then, with
mandMdened by (16.10),

Proof. We have already shown the rst part, that mandMare in
the spectrum so it remains to show that A zis invertible for all
zC \[m,M ].
Using the selfadjointness
(16.12) Im(Az),=Imz2.
This implies that Azis invertible if z C \R.First it shows that
(Az)= 0 implies = 0, soAzis injective. Secondly, the range is
closed. Indeed, if (A z)nthen applying (16.12) directly shows
thatn is bounded and so can be replaced by a weakly convergent
subsequence. Applying (16.12) again to nmshows that the se
quence is actually Cauchy, hence convergens to so (Az)=is in
the range. Finally, the orthocomplement to this range is the null space
ofA z,which is also trivial, so Azis an isomorphism and (16.12)
also shows that the inverse is bounded, in fact

Here we need to recall from Proposition 3.2 that continuous functions
onX, a locally compact metric space, are (Borel) measurable. Further
more, we know that there is an increasing sequence of simple functions
with limitf, so
(4.25)
Xfd
(X)f .
This shows that uin (4.24) iscontinuous and that its norm u  
(X). In fact
(4.26) u=(X).
Indeed, the inner regularity of implies that there is a compact set
K Xwith(K)(X)1
n; then there is fC
1c(X) with 0f1
, for anyn. andf= 1 onK. It follows that (f)(K)(X)
This proves (4.26).
We still have to show that ifn
uis dened by (4.24), with a nite
positive Radon measure, then the measure  dened from uvia (4.24)
is precisely itself.
This is easy provided we keep things clear. Starting from  0 a
nite Radon measure, dene uby (4.24) and, for UXopen
(4.27) (U) = sup fd, 0f1, fC(X),supp(f ) U.

By the properties of the integral,  (U)(U).Conversely if K U
there exists an element f Cc(X),0 f 1,f= 1 onKand
supp(f )U.Then we know that
(4.28) (U) fd(K).
X
By the inner regularity of , we can choose K Usuch that(K) 
(U), given&gt;0. Thus (U) =(U).
This proves the Riesz representation theorem, modulo the decompo
sition of the measure  which I will do in class if the demand is there!
In my view this is quite enough measure theory.  
Notice that we have in fact proved something stronger than the state
ment of the theorem. Namely we have shown that under the correspondenceu
,
(4.29) u=(X) =:.
Thus the map is an isometry.1</text>

In particular this means that if we choose C(Rn) with 0/supp()c
2kthen for every k,/|x| is smooth and
F=x2kFC22n, &gt;n.

ThusFC(Rn) and this is what we wanted to show, sing supp(F )c

So now we have actually proved that Pm(D) is hypoelliptic if it is
elliptic. Rather than go through the proof again to make sure, let me
go on to the general case and in doing so review it.
Proof. Proof of theorem. We need to show that if P() is elliptic then
P(D) has a parametrix Fas in (11.27). From the discussion above the
ellipticity of P() implies (and is equivalent to)
m, c&gt; 0. |Pm()|c|| 
On the other hand
P()Pm() =C
&lt;m| |
is a polynomial of degree at most m1, so
P()Pm() 2C(1 +)m1. ||||
This means that id C &gt; 0 is large enough then in || &gt; C,C(1 +
m||)m1&lt;c, so2|| 
P()||Pm()P()Pm() ||| | 
mC(1 +||)m1c. c|| m 2|| 
This means that P() itself satises the conditions of Lemma 11.14.
Thus ifC(Rn) is equal to 1 in a large enough ball then Q(xi) =c
(1())/P() inC and satises (11.36) which can be written
DQ()|C(1 +)m|| . | ||
The discussion above now shows that dening FS(Rn) byF() =
Q() gives a solution to (11.27).
The last step in the proof is to show that if FS(Rn) has compact
support, and satises (11.27), then
), P(D)uS(Rn) uS(Rn)C(Rn
u=F(P(D)u)uC(Rn).
Let me rene this result a little bit.</text>

Problem 69. [Spectral theorem, compact case] Recall that a bounded 
operator A on a Hilbert space H is compact if A{u  1} is pre-
compact (has compact closure). Throughout this problem A will be a 
compact operator on a separable Hilbert space, H.

over N such that the result is true for all j with Nj &lt; N. So, 
consider what happens for a value of j with Nj = Nj1 + 1 and 
add element eNj  Vj which is orthogonal to all the previous 
k s. 
ii) A Hilbert space is separable if it has a countable dense subset 
(sometimes people say Hilbert space when they mean separable 
Hilbert space). Show that every separable Hilbert space has a 
complete orthonormal sequence, that is a sequence {ej } such

out restriction on supports. Show that for each N

||N, |x|N 
is a seminorn on C(Rn) (meaning it satises f 0, cf= 
|c|f for c  C and the triangle inequality but that f= 0 
does not necessarily imply that f = 0.) 
iv) Show that C(Rn)  C(Rn) is dense in the sense that for c 
each f  C(Rn) there is a sequence fn in C(Rn) such that c 
f fn(N) 0 for each N. 
v) Let E(Rn) temporarily (or permanantly if you prefer) denote 
the dual space of C(Rn) (which is also written E(Rn)), that 
is, v  E(Rn) is a linear map v : C(Rn)  C which is 
continuous in the sense that for some N

(Rn). when considered as an element of C
viii) Show the converse, that each element of C(Rn) with compact 
support is an element of E(Rn)  C(Rn) and hence conclude 
that E(Rn) is the space of distributions of compact support.

i) A pre-Hilbert space is a vector space V (over C) with a positive 
denite sesquilinear inner product i.e. a function 
V V (v, w)  v, w C 
satisfying 
w, v= v, w 
a1v1 + a2v2, w= a1v1, w+ a2v2, w 
v, v 0 
v, v= 0 v = 0.
Prove Schwarz inequality, that
1 1 |u, v|  u2 v2 u, v V. 
Hint: Reduce to the case v, v= 1 and then expand 
u  u, vv, u  u, vv 0. 
ii) Show that v = v, v1/2 is a norm and that it satises the 
parallelogram law: 
(17.9) v1 + v22 + v1 v22 = 2v12 + 2v22 v1, v2 V. 
iii) Conversely, suppose that V is a linear space over C with a norm 
which satises (17.9). Show that 
2 24v, w= v + w2  v w+ iv + iw2 iv iw
denes a pre-Hilbert inner product which gives the original 
norm. 
iv) Let V be a Hilbert space, so as in (i) but complete as well. 
Let C  V be a closed non-empty convex subset, meaning 
v, w  C  (v + w)/2  C. Show that there exists a unique 
v C minimizing the norm, i.e. such that 
v= inf w. 
wC 
Hint: Use the parallelogram law to show that a norm mini
mizing sequence is Cauchy. 
v) Let u : H  C be a continuous linear functional on a Hilbert 
space, so |u()|  C    H. Show that N = {  
H; u() = 0} is closed and that if v0  H has u(v0) = 0 then 
each v H can be written uniquely in the form 
v = cv0 + w, c C, w N. 
vi) With u as in v), not the zero functional, show that there exists 
a unique f H with u(f) = 1 and w, f= 0 for all w N.

of this space. 
(2) Dene a subset U  Cc(Rn) to be open if its intersection with 
each of the subspaces on the right in (17.28) is open w.r.t. the 
supremum norm. 
(3) Show that this denition does yield a topology. 
f(4) Show that any sequence {fn}which is Cauchy in the sense that 
for any open neighbourhood U of 0 there exists N such that fn  
m  U for all n,m  N, is convergent (in the corresponding 
sense that there exists f in the space such that f fn  U 
eventually). 
(5) If you are determined, discuss the corresponding issue for nets. 
Problem 74. Show that the continuity of a linear functional u : C(Rn) c 
C with respect to the inductive limit topology dened in (6.16) means 
precisely that for each n N there exists k = k(n) and C = Cn such 
that 
(17.29) |u()| CCk ,   C(B(n)). 
The point of course is that the order k and the constnat C can both 
increase as n, measuring the size of the support, increases. 
Problem 75. [Restriction from Sobolev spaces] The Sobolev embedding 
theorem shows that a function in Hm(Rn), for m &gt; n/2 is continuous 
 and hence can be restricted to a subspace of Rn . In fact this works 
more generally. Show that there is a well dened restriction map 
(17.30) Hm(Rn)  Hm 1 1 
2 (Rn) if m &gt; 2 
with the following properties: 
(1) On S(Rn) it is given by u u(0,x), x Rn1 . 
(2) It is continuous and linear. 
Hint: Use the usual method of nding a weak version of the map on 
smooth Schwartz functions; namely show that in terms of the Fourier 
transforms on Rn and Rn1 
  (17.31) u(0,)() = (2)1 u(1,)d1,  Rn1 . 
R 
Use Cauchys inequality to show that this is continuous as a map on 
Sobolev spaces as indicated and then the density of S(Rn) in Hm(Rn) 
to conclude that the map is well-dened and unique.

Problem 72. [Compactness of sets in L2(Rn).] Show that a subset B 
L2(Rn) is precompact in L2(Rn) if and only if it satises the following 
two conditions: 
i) (Equi-continuity in the mean) For each &gt;0 there exists  &gt;0 
such that 
(17.26) |u(x+ y) u(x)|2dx&lt;  |y|&lt;, uB. 
Rn 
ii) (Equi-smallness at innity) For each &gt;0 there exists Rsuch 
that 
(17.27) |u|2dx&lt; uB. 
|x|&gt;R| 
Hint: Problem 70 shows that (17.26) holds for each uL2(Rn); check 
that (17.27) also holds for each function. Then use a covering argument 
to prove that both these conditions must hold for a compact subset of 
L2(R) and hence for a precompact set. One method to prove the con
verse is to show that if (17.26) and (17.27) hold then B is bounded 
and to use this to extract a weakly convergent sequence from any given 
sequence in B.Next show that (17.26) is equivalent to (17.27) for the 
set F(B), the image of B under the Fourier transform. Show, possi
bly using Problem 71, that if R is cut-o to a ball of radius R then 
RG(R un) converges strongly if un converges weakly. Deduce from 
this that the weakly convergent subsequence in fact converges strongly 
so B is sequently compact, and hence is compact. 
RProblem 73. Consider the space Cc(Rn) of all continuous functions on

some R,depending on the function. We want to give this a toplogy in

17. Problems 
Problem 1. Prove that u+, dened by (1.10) is linear. 
Problem 2. Prove Lemma 1.8. 
Hint(s). All functions here are supposed to be continuous, I just 
dont bother to keep on saying it. 
(1) Recall, or check, that the local compactness of a metric space 
X means that for each point x  X there is an  &gt; 0 such that 
the ball { y  X; d(x,y)  } is compact for   . 
(2) First do the case n = 1, so K  U is a compact set in an open 
subset. 
(a) Given  &gt; 0, use the local compactness of X, to cover K 
with a nite number of compact closed balls of radius at 
most . 
(b) Deduce that if	 &gt; 0 is small enough then the set { x  
X; d(x,K )  } , where 
d(x,K ) = inf d(x,y), 
yK 
is compact. 
(c) Show that d(x,K ), for K compact, is continuous. 
(d) Given  &gt; 0 show that there is a continuous function g : 
R  [0,1] such that g(t) = 1 for t  /2 and g(t) = 0 
for t &gt; 3/4. 
(e) Show that f = g  d( ,K) satises the conditions for n = 1 
if  &gt; 0 is small enough. 
(3) Prove the general case by induction over n. 
(a) In the general case, set K = K  U and show that the 1 
finductive hypothesis applies to K and the Uj for j &gt; 1; let 
j  , j = 2,...,n be the functions supplied by the inductive 
assumption and put f = 
j2 fj  . 
1(b) Show that K1 = K  { f  2 } U1. is a compact subset of 
(c) Using the case	n = 1 construct a function F for K1 and 
U1. 
(d) Use the case n = 1 again to nd G such that G = 1 on K 
G)  { f + 1 
2 } . and supp( F &gt; 
(e) Make sense of the functions 
G G f1 = F , fj = fj  
f + F, j  2 f + F

Problem 15. Using Problem 14 show that if  is a nite Borel measure 
on a locally compact metric space X then the following three conditions 
are equivalent 
(1)  = 1 2 with 1 and 2 both positive nite Radon measures. 
(2) || is a nite positive Radon measure. 
(3) + and  are nite positive Radon measures. 
Problem 16. Let  be a norm on a vector space V . Show that u= 
(u, u)1/2 for an inner product satisfying (5.1) - (5.4) if and only if the 
parallelogram law holds for every pair u, v V . 
Hint (From Dimitri Kountourogiannis) 
If   comes from an inner product, then it must satisfy the polari
sation identity: 
2(x, y) = 1/4(x + y2  x y2 ix + iy2 ix iy) 
i.e, the inner product is recoverable from the norm, so use the RHS 
(right hand side) to dene an inner product on the vector space. You 
will need the paralellogram law to verify the additivity of the RHS. 
Note the polarization identity is a bit more transparent for real vector 
spaces. There we have 
2(x, y) = 1/2(x + y2  x y) 
both are easy to prove using a2 = (a, a). 
Problem 17. Show (Rudin does it) that if u : Rn C has continuous 
partial derivatives then it is dierentiable at each point in the sense of 
(6.5).

that 
f = lj (x)  x3

0 k (Rn) for all k.

Problem 23. Prove (8.9) where 
   j (z; x ) = (z + tx) dt. zj 0 
Problem 24. Prove (8.20). You will probably have to go back to rst 
principles to do this. Show that it is enough to assume u 0 has 
compact support. Then show it is enough to assume that u is a simple, 
and integrable, function. Finally look at the denition of Lebesgue 
measure and show that if E Rn is Borel and has nite Lebesgue

Proof. The Hilbert space property follows essentially directly from the 
denition (9.14) since mL2(Rn) is a Hilbert space with the norm 
(9.17). Similarly the density of S in Hm(Rn) follows, since S(Rn) dense 
in L2(Rn) (Problem L11.P3) implies mS(Rn) = S(Rn) is dense in 
mL2(Rn) and so, since F is an isomorphism in S(Rn), S(Rn) is 
dense in Hm(Rn). 
m  Finally observe that the pairing in (9.18) makes sense, since u(), 
mu() L2(Rn) implies 
u())u() L1(Rn) . 
Furthermore, by the self-duality of L2(Rn) each continuous linear func
tional 
U : Hm(Rn) C , U(u) CuHm 
can be written uniquely in the form 
U(u) = ((u,u )) for some u  Hm(Rn) . 
Notice that if u,u  S(Rn) then  
((u,u )) = u(x)u (x) dx. 
Rn 
This is always how we pair functions  it is the natural pairing on 
L2(Rn). Thus in (9.18) what we have shown is that this pairing on test 
function 
 
S(Rn)  S(Rn) (u,u )  ((u,u )) = u(x)u (x) dx 
Rn 
extends by continuity to Hm(Rn) Hm(Rn) (for each xed m) when 
it identies Hm(Rn) as the dual of Hm(Rn). This was our picture 
at the beginning. 
For m &gt; 0 the spaces Hm(Rn) represents elements of L2(Rn) that 
have m derivatives in L2(Rn). For m &lt; 0 the elements are ?? of up 
to m derivatives of L2 functions. For integers this is precisely ??.</text>

Now that we have considered the Fourier transform of Schwartz test 
functions we can use the usual method, of duality, to extend it to 
tempered distributions. If we set  = then =  and  = G= G 
so 
 
(x) = (2)n e ix () d 
 
ix= (2)n e  () d = (2)n(x). 
Substituting in (9.5) we nd that 
  
 dx =  d .  
Now, recalling how we embed S(Rn)  S(Rn) we see that 
() = u( (9.10) u )   S(Rn) .
Denition 9.5. If u  S(Rn) we dene its Fourier transform by
(9.11) u() = u(  )   S(Rn) .
As a composite map,  = u  F, with each term continuous, 
 u u is 
continuous, i.e., u  S(Rn). 
Proposition 9.6. The denition (9.7) gives an isomorphism 
 F : S(Rn)  S(Rn) , Fu = u 
satisfying the identities 
(9.12) Du =  u , x u . u = (1)||D 
Proof. Since u = u  F and G is the 2-sided inverse of F, 
 (9.13) u = u  G 
gives the inverse to F : S(Rn)  S(Rn), showing it to be an isomor
phism. The identities (9.12) follow from their counterparts on S(Rn): 
Du() = D u(  ) ) = u((1)||D 
= u(u() =   ) =  u()   S(Rn) . 
We can also dene Sobolev spaces of negative order:
 mL2(Rn
(9.14) Hm(Rn) = 
u  S(Rn) ; u   )

Proposition 9.7. If m 0 is an integer then u Hm(Rn) if and only 
if it can be written in the form 
(9.15)
 u =

D v , v L2(Rn) . 
||m 
Proof. If u  S(Rn) is of the form (9.15) then 

 v with v L2(Rn(9.16) u = ) . 
||m 
m u =

mv. Since all the factors  mThus  are||m 
bounded, each term here is in L2(Rn), so m u L2(Rn) which is the 
denition, u  mL2(Rn). 
Conversely, suppose u  Hm(Rn), i.e., m u  L2(Rn). The func
tion

 
||   m L2(Rn) (m &lt; 0) 
||m 
is bounded below by a positive constant. Thus 
v =

9. Fourier inversion
It is shown above that the Fourier transform satises the identity 
 
 (9.1) (0) = (2)n	() d   S(Rn) . 
Rn 
If y  Rn and   S(Rn) set (x) = (x + y). The translation-
invariance of Lebesgue measure shows that 
 
ix() = e (x + y) dx 
iy  = e ( ) . 
Applied to  the inversion formula (9.1) becomes 
 
(9.2)	 (y) = (0) = (2)n () d 
 
iy  = (2)n e ( ) d . 
Rn 
Theorem 9.1. Fourier transform F : S(Rn)  S(Rn) is an isomor
phism with inverse 
 
(9.3) G: S(Rn)  S(Rn) , G(y) = (2)n eiy () d . 
Proof. The identity (9.2) shows that F is 1 1, i.e., injective, since we 
can remove  from . Moreover, 
(9.4)	 G(y) = (2)nF(y) 
So G is also a continuous linear map, G : S(Rn)  S(Rn). Indeed 
the argument above shows that G  F = Id and the same argument, 
with some changes of sign, shows that F  G = Id. Thus F and G are 
isomorphisms. 
Lemma 9.2. For all ,   S(Rn), Pasevals identity holds: 
  
  (9.5)	  dx = (2)n  d .

Proof. Using the inversion formula on , 
ix  
 dx = (2)n 
e ( ) d
(x) dx 
  
 = (2)n () eix (x) dx d 
 
= (2)n ()() d . 
Here the integrals are absolutely convergent, justifying the exchange of 
orders. 
Proposition 9.3. Fourier transform extends to an isomorphism 
(9.6) F : L2(Rn) L2(Rn) . 
Proof. Setting  =  in (9.5) shows that 
(9.7)	 FL2 = (2)n/2L2 . 
In particular this proves, given the known density of S(Rn) in L2(Rn), 
that F is an isomorphism, with inverse G, as in (9.6). 
For any m R
m u L2(Rn)
x L2(Rn) = 
u  S(Rn) ; x m 
is a well-dened subspace. We dene the Sobolev spaces on Rn by, for 
m 0 
mL2(Rn)
(9.8) Hm(Rn) = 
u L2(Rn) ; u = Fu   . 
Thus Hm(Rn) Hm(Rn) if m m , H0(Rn) = L2(Rn) . 
Lemma 9.4. If m N is an integer, then 
(9.9)	 u Hm(Rn) D u L2(Rn)  || m . 
m  Proof. By denition, u H m(Rn) implies that u L2(Rn). Since 
Du =  u this certainly implies that D u  L2(Rn) for	||  m. 
Conversely if Du L2(Rn) for all || m then  u L2(Rn) for all 
|| m and since 
 m Cm 
||. 
||m 
this in turn implies that m u L2(Rn).</text>

kv(x) =u(x)p(x) =u(k)()u(k)(0)xk!
forbetween 0 and x, and since u(k)is continuous, ( u(x)p(x))/xk
tends to 0 as xtends to 0.

Solution 18.8. Since
  
DxH() =H(Dx) =i H (x)(x)dx=i (x)dx=i(0(0)) =i(),
0  
we getDxH=CforC=i.
Solution 18.9. It is equivalent to ask when m0is inL2(Rn). Since
0() =0() =(0) =(x)dx= 1( ),
Rn
this is equivalent to nding msuch that2mhas a nite integral over
Rn. One option is to write = (1 +r2)1/2in spherical coordinates,
and to recall that the Jacobian of spherical coordinates in ndimensions
has the form rn1(1,...,n1), and so2mis integrable if and only
if  rn1
dr(1 +r2)m0
converges. It is obvious that this is true if and only if n12m&lt;1,
ie. if and only if m&gt;n/2.

18.Solutions to (some of) the problems 
Solution	 18.1 (To Problem 10). (by Matja z Konvalinka).
Since the topology on N,inherited from R,is discrete, a set is com
pact if and only if it is nite. If a sequence {xn} (i.e. a function N C)
is inC0(N) if and only if for any  &gt;0 there exists a compact (hence
nite) setFso that|xn| &lt;for anynnot inF.We can assume that
F={1,...,n},which gives us the condition that {xn} is inC0(N)
if and only if it converges to 0 .We denote this space by c0,and the
supremum norm by   0.A sequence{xn} will be abbreviated to x.
Letl1denote the space of (real or complex) sequences xwith a nite
1norm

=xn|.x1|
n=1
We can dene pointwise summation and multiplication with scalars,
and (l1,  1) is a normed (in fact Banach) space. Because the func
tional

x0,the mapping x0y1) by |

=1nxnyn x y 
n=1
is a (linear) welldened mapping with norm at most 1 .In fact,  is
an isometry because if |xj| =x0then (x)( ej)| = 1 where ejis |
thejth unit vector. We claim that  is also surjective (and hence an
isometric isomorphism). If is a functional on c0let us denote (ej)

=1n byxj.Then (x)(y)(en)yn(ynen) =(y) (the = =
yenn =1n last equality holds because converges to yinc0andis
continuous with respect to the topology in c0), so (x) =.
Solution 18.2 (To Problem 29). (Matja z Konvalinka) Since

(x)dx=i(0 (0)) =i(),

we getDxH=CforC=i.</text>

A similar estimate as x follows from (18.1). Now, Ais clearly

Finally then, given u S(R) dene v() =u(A ).From the
continuity of A, v S(R) and from the denition of A, A() =.
Thus
dvdv/dx () =v() =u(A) =u() = = u.dx
Solution 18.6. We have to prove that m+m u L2(Rn), in other
words, that

But that is true since

so by above u(x) =wx(1) is the sum of some polynomial p(od degree
k), and we have
(k) (k)u(x)p(x)vx(1)wx(x)wx(0), = =x x k!|x|k | |k| |k

withl1+...+li=kand 0&lt; x&lt;1. This tends to zero as x
because the derivative is continuous.
Solution 18.4 (Solution to Problem 41). (Matj z Konvalinka) Obviously
the mapC0(Bn) C(Bn) is injective (since it is just the inclusion map),
andf C(Bn) is inC0(Bn) if and only if it is zero on Bn,ie. if and
only iff|Sn1 = 0. It remains to prove that any map gonSn1is the
restriction of a continuous function on Bn.This is clear since
xg(x/|x|)x= 0f(x) =| |
0 x= 0
is welldened, coincides with fonSn1, and is continuous: if Mis
the maximum of |g| onSn1, and &gt;0 is given, then f(x)&lt; for| |
x &lt;/M.| | 
Solution 18.5. (partly Matja z Konvalinka)
For any S(R)
 we have

ThusS(R)  R dx is continous.
Now, choose  C(R)withR (x)dx = 1. Then, for S(R),c
set
x  
(18.1)A(x) = ( (t)c()(t))dt, c () =(s)ds.
  
Note that the assumption on means that
 
(18.2) A(x) = ( (t)c()(t))dt

ClearlyAis smooth, and in fact it is a Schwartz function since

13. Homogeneous distributions 
Next time I will talk about homogeneous distributions. On R the 
functions 
sx x &gt; 0 s x = t 0 x &lt; 0 
where S R, is locally integrable (and hence a tempered distribution) 
precisely when S &gt; 1. As a function it is homogeneous of degree s. 
Thus if a &gt; 0 then 
s s(ax)s = a x .t t
s
Thinking of x= s as a distribution we can set this as t 
 
s(ax)() = s(ax)(x) dx 

 dx = s(x)(x/a) a 
s = a s() . 
Thus if we dene a(x) = 1 ( x ), for any a &gt; 0,   S(R) we can ask a a 
whether a distribution is homogeneous: 
s (a) = a ()   S(R).</text>
