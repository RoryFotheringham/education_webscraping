          <text>(1) Allocation of prepaid insurance cost 
 Kings Shoe Store paid $1,500 on January 1, 2000, for a three-year insurance 
policy - Transaction #8 
 
 During the year 2000, one-third of the coverage expired, so $500 of the 
premium should leave the asset account on the balance sheet and become an 
insurance expense, reducing income and retained earnings. 
 
In other words, the balance sheet on December 31, 2000, should show only 
$1,000 of prepaid insurance as an asset.

          <text>Adjusting Entries 
 Adjusting the events that continually occur for which no specific transaction 
signals the requirement for a journal entry but that still affect the net income 
for the period and the financial position at the end of the period 
 
 Adjusting entries prepared at the end of the accounting period change the 
balances in the general ledger accounts so that all revenues and expenses 
are recognized 
 
 For example, 
 
  - Recognition of accrued revenues and receivables 
  - Recognition of accrued expenses and payables 
  - Allocation of prepaid operating costs, e.g. prepaid insurance cost 
  - Recognition of Depreciation 
  - Correction of errors, etc.

 Let us assume that Kings Shoe Store should pay income tax at 35% of operating 
income 
 
 The operating income can be calculated by subtracting total operating expenses 
from total revenue, i.e., 
 
  Operating income = Total revenue - Total operating expenses 
         = Total revenue - (Cost of Goods  Sold +  
        Salary Expense +  
        Insurance Expense +

          <text>(2) Recognition of Depreciation 
 Although the assets of buildings and equipment provide services for a number of 
years, their future benefits expire as time passes. Therefore, accounting spreads 
an assets cost over the periods of the assets estimated useful life.  
 
 The term depreciation refers to the charge made to the current operations for the 
portion of the cost of such assets consumed during the current period.   The 
straight-line method is widely used for depreciation calculations 
 
 Kings Shoe Stores internal records show that annual depreciation is $30,000 
per year.

Engineering/design decisions have major 
impact on operations and customer service 
Consider all the costs, especially when things 
do not go according to plan 
Measurements and rewards change behavior,

          <text>What happens to forecast error if we have a 
universal power supply? 
The variability of the forecast errors would combine as follows: 
2 1 2 
2 2 
1 2     + + = new At start-up the individual errors are 
80%+. If the errors tend to offset each other, then the combined error will be closer to 40%. 
where: 
 1,2 are the individual product forecast error standard deviations 
 is the correlation coefficient of the two errors 
Lets say your individual forecast value is 1.0 and  1,2 both equal 0.4 (40%). If the errors are completely 
uncorrelated ( =0), then the standard deviation of the forecast error of the combined product stream would 
be 0.57 or 28% of the combined forecast of 2.0 
If people tend to buy one product or the other, and a drop in one always occurs with a rise in the other 
(perfect negative correlation,  = -1), then the new standard deviation would be 0.0 
If, say, world events always cause similar errors in both products (perfect positive correlation,  = 1) then 
the new standard deviation would be 0.80 or 40% of the combined forecast. 
So you can onl y get better b y combinin g products. At maturity the individual errors are 
~40%. If the errors tend to offset each other, then the combined error will be closer to 20%.
