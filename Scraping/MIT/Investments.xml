When we aggregate the portfolios of all individual investors, lending and borrowing

          <text>So it must be that:
 E (ri)  rf = A cov (rM ,ri) (11) 
Recall that: 
 E (rM )  rf = A var (rM ) (12) 
This takes us to: 
E (ri)  rf = i (E (rM )  rf ) (13) 
where 
cov (rM ,ri)i = (14) var (rM )

for any utility function with a preference for mean, and aversion to variance.</text>

          <text>A Linear Factor Model
A simple model to capture these two types of risks is the linear factor model: 
ri = E (ri)+ i  F + i (18) 
which carries two risky components: 
 systematic F : common to all securities. 
 idiosyncr atic i: specic only to securit y i. 
Both the common factor F and the idiosyncratic component are zero mean random 
variables.</text>

STEP 1: We start with X1, assume that it is standard normal, and simulate it 10,000 
times. Using the 10,000 scenarios, we plot its empirical probabilit y distribution, 
which is basically the histogram of the 10,000 scenarios normalized so that the total 
probabilit y is one. For notational purpose, we write y1 = xi.

STEP 2: We repeat STEP 1 ten times, each time with a new seed in our random 
number generator, so that xi,x2,...,x10 are indeed independen t. We add them up, 
scenario by scenario, and re scale the sum by 10. That is, we have 10,000 scenarios of

          <text>The CAPM 
In market equilibrium, investors are only rewarded for bearing systematic risk -the 
type of risk that cannot be diversied away. 
They should not be rewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risk, since this uncertain ty 
can be mitigated through appropriate diversication. 
Sharp e on CAPM 
Bill Sharp e, one of the originators of the CAPM, in an interview with the Dow Jones 
Asset Manager: 
But the fundamental idea remains that theres no reason to expect re-
ward just for bearing risk. Otherwise, youd make a lot of money in Las 
Vegas. If theres reward for risk, its got to be special. Theres got to be 
some economics behind it or else the world is a very crazy place. I dont 
think dierently about those basic ideas at all.

          <text>Pricing the Individual Risky Assets
The market portfolio is made of individual risky assets: 
rM = w1r1 + w2r2 + ... + wN rN (5) 
where wi is the fraction of total market wealth invested in asset i. 
How are the individual risky assets priced in equilibrium? 
To answer this question, we deviate the equilibrium holding wi of asset i slightly away 
from its optimal level, and see how such a deviation aect our investors maximized 
utility. 
Lets focus on a represen tative investor with the average risk aversion .

          <text>Introduction
So far, we took the expected return of risky asset as given. But where does expected 
return come from? 
Using the intuition that investors are risk averse, one explanation is that the risk 
premium -expected return in excess of the riskfree rate -is a reward for bearing risk. 
Does this make sense? 
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a simple, yet elegan t framew ork 
for us to think about the question of reward and risk.</text>

          <text>Risk and Reward in the CAPM
For a risky asset ri, the right measure of the rewardable risk is not its variance var (ri), 
but its covariance cov (ri,rM ) with the market. 
The exposure to the market risk can be best quantied by: 
cov (rM ,ri)i = (15) var (rM ) 
For one unit exposure to the market risk, the reward is the same as the market: 
E(rM )  rf (16) 
For  unit of exposure to the market, the reward is: 
i  (E (rM )  rf ) (17) 
For zero exposure to the market risk, the reward is zero, no matter how risky the asset 
is. In summary , the risk and reward relation in the CAPM is a linear relation. 
Systematic vs. Idiosyncratic 
Each investmen t carries two distinct risks: 
	Systematic risk is market-wide and pervasively inuences virtually all securit y 
prices. 
Examples are interest rates and the business cycle. 
	Idiosyncr atic risk involves unexp ected events peculiar to a single securit y or a 
limited number of securities. 
Examples are the loss of a key contract or a change in governmen t policy toward 
a specic industry .</text>

          <text>The Arbitrage Pricing Theory 
A SINGLE-F ACTOR VERSION 
Assume a frictionless market with no taxes or transaction costs. Assets are perfectly 
divisible. There is no short-sale constrain t. 
Assume a one-factor linear model: 
 i asset is sensitivit y to the common factor. 
 F common factor, with E(F ) = 0. 
 i rm-sp ecic return, with zero mean, and independen t of the common factor or 
other rms idiosyncratic component. 
Possible common factor: unexp ected changes in ination, industrial production, etc. 
The Arbitrage Pricing Theory: 
E (ri  rf ) E (rj  rf ) = (19)i j 
The expected return of any asset is determined by its exposure to the common factor, 
and has nothing to do with its idiosyncratic component. 
In deriving APT, one need not make any assumption about investors preferences, 
or assume any specic distribution for the asset returns. 
The APT is not an equilibrium concept. It does not rely on the existence of a market 
portfolio. It is based purely on no-arbitrage conditions.</text>

          <text>Summary
In equilibrium, the tangency portfolio becomes the market portfolio. The expected 
return of the market portfolio depends on the average risk aversion in the market. 
The intuition of the CAPM: expected return of any risky asset depends linearly on 
its exposure to the market risk, measured by . 
Diversication is an important concept in nance. It builds on a power mathemat
ical machine called Strong Law of Large Number. 
Like the CAPM, the basic concept of the APT is that dierences in expected return 
must be driven by dierences in non-div ersiable risk. 
The APT is based purely on no-arbitrage condition. It is not an equilibrium con
cept, and does not depend on having a market portfolio.

          <text>Example of 3: The wheat processor taking spot delivery from 
the farmer is not certain when she needs to take delivery. In 
other words, the timing of buyers' demand is not known with 
certainty. 
Strengthening of the basis (i.e., [S(T) -F(T,T')] ing) benefits the 
short hedger (farmer). Conversely, weakening of the basis benefits the long hedger.

          <text>standardization of (exchange -traded) futures contracts. Forward 
contracts are usually tailor-made and hence do not carry basis risk. 
We speak in terms of forward contracts just to illustrate ideas and 
because we do not cover futures contracts until later. Hence, the 
term futures contracts is more correct usage instead of forward contracts in this sub-section. And i gnore margins.) 
	Example of 1: The forward (futures) contract expires on June 
15 while spot delivery is set for May 15. The norm is to choose 
a forwa rd (futures) delivery month T', which falls after the spot 
delivery date T. This is because the front-end forward (futures) 
price is usually very volatile when close to expiration. Picking 
a later-dated forward (futures) contract reduces this risk. The 
forward (futures) contract is usually unwound just prior to spot 
delivery. 
	Example of 2: The underlying contract in the forward (futures) 
contract is corn while the spot delivery calls for wheat. Us u
ally, the forward (futures) with an underlying which is mos t 
closely corre lated in price to the spot contract is chosen.

          <text>Convenience Value of Commodities
	Convenience is the benefit from storage of the physical co m
modity, but not from holding the forward cont ract on the 
physical commo dity. 
	Storage may benefit from profit opportunities available when 
there are temporary shortages in the commodity, perhaps 
avoiding su spension of the production process. 
	Frequently, due to a shortage, the asset underlying the forward 
contract cannot be borrowed in order to execute a short sale. 
The short age arises mainly due to the convenience arising 
from owning the asset spot for the production process. 
	When shortages occur, the spot price for the commodity is 
high, generating a convenience yield. 
	When the convenience is high, the spot-forward curve goes into backwardation mode, i.e., (loosely speaking) the term 
structure of current forward prices is lower than the spot price. 
(Note: The spot price may also drop dramatically, due to a 
temporary glut or oversupply, causing the spot-forward curve

In a well-functioning market, the forward price at delivery is equal 
to the prevailing spot price. Mathe matically, 
F(T,T) = S(T).
However, convergence is not always the norm. Frequently, the for-
ward price does not converge to the spot price due to: 
	the date of spot delivery T, does not ma tch the date of hedge 
expiration T (with T  T'), 
	the assets underlying spot and forward contracts are not identical, and 
 the date of spot delivery, T, is uncertain.

cost of carry rel ation with the present v alue of storage costs, 
with the appropriate adjust ment in sign. 
	Usually, commodities have no dividends or cash payouts associated with them, hence, we only have to consider storage 
costs when determining the cost of carry relation for them. 
	Similarly, fi nancial assets usually have dividends or cash pay-
outs but do not have storage costs associated with them, hence, 
we only have to consider div idends when determining the cost 
of carry rel ation for them.

Consider the following typical Short Hedge. 
a) A farmer has wheat to sell at harvest time, which we pre tend to 
know to be at date T with certainty. 
b) At t = 0: farmer shorts a forward contract at F(0,T') for deli v
ery at T' after (but close to) T. (Assume that's b ecause there isn't a 
forward contract of identical maturity to the spo t delivery date T.) 
At t = T: farmer sells spot wheat at S(T) and closes out forward 
position at F(T,T').

The difference between these two prices, i.e., [S(T) -F(T,T')],  is

	Some financial assets, like Treasury bonds and mortgage -
backed securities, have convenience values due to their colla t
eral value available in repo (repurchase) markets. In other

          <text>Constant Proportional Storage Costs (Known Storage Costs) 
	Recall, financial assets may h ave cash payouts which have to 
be factored in the cost of carry relation. In the case of stocks, 
the payouts are dividends, while for Treasury bonds, they are 
coupons. 
	Non-financial assets, such as gold, silver, oil, corn, etc., have 
storage costs associated with the cash-and-carry strategy. The 
alteration to the cash-and-carry strategy of before is that we 
have to consider, both, the cost of financing (i.e., the standard 
shorting of K bonds) as well as the cost of storage when pur
chasing the asset spot. 
	Notice that dividends over the life of the forward contract are a 
benefit accruing solely to the spot asset holder and not the 
forward contract party, while storage costs over the life of the 
forward contract are a disbenefit borne by the spot asset holder 
and not the forward contract party. 
	Hence, storage costs can be viewed as a negative dividend 
payout. Depending on how storage costs are defined, all we

The forward rates can be given two interpretations; the break-ev en rate 
or the locked in -even though the two are very similar. The forward 
rates are break even rates in the sense that if they are realize all bond po
sitions earn the same return. Therefore, if you for example expect rates 
to rise by less than what is implied by the forward rates you should take 
a bullish stance (buy bonds) as lower interest rates will imply higher 
bond prices. 
Determining the (implied) forward rates from spot rates: 
The general formula (annualized rate): 
 Note that 1f0 = S1 and that if spot rates are increasing linearly , the 
forward rates will be increasing with a slope twice the slope of the 
spot rates, 
 if the spot rates changes from increasing to decreasing, i.e. the yield 
curve is humped shaped, the forward rate curve will go through the 
maxim um of the spot rates curve, 
 if the spot rates are constan t, so is the forward rates at the same 
level. 
If we for example have S1 = 4% and S2 =8.167%  1f1 = 12.501%. 
Similarly :(1.12377)3 = (1.04) (1.12501) (1+ 1f2) or (1.08167)2 (1+ 1f2) 
both implies that 1f2 = 21.295%. 
Determining spot rates from forward rates: 
(1 + S2)3 = (1+ 1f0)(1 + 1f1)(1 + 1f2) (8)</text>

          <text>Foreign Currencies
The underlying asset in such contracts is a certain number of units of 
the foreign currency . We will dene the variable S0 as the curren t spot 
price, measured in dollars, of one unit of the foreign currency and F0 as 
the forward price, measured in dollars, of one unit of the foreign cur
rency. This is consisten t with the way we have dened S0 and F0 for 
other assets underlying forward contracts. However, it does not always 
corresp ond to the way spot and forward exchanges rates are quoted. For 
all major exchange rates, except the British pound, a spot or forward 
exchange rate is normally quoted as the number of units of the currency 
that are equivalent to one dollar. For the British pound, it is quoted as 
the number of dollars per unit of the foreign currency . 
A foreign currency has the property that the holder of the currency 
can earn interest at the risk-free interest rate prevailing in the foreign 
country. For example, the holder can invest the currency in a foreign-
denominated bond. We dene rf as the value of this foreign risk-free 
interest rate for a maturit y T with continuous compounding. As before, 
r is the domestic risk-free rate for this maturit y. 
The relationship between F0 and S0 is: 
F0 = S0  e(rrf )T (25) 
This is the well-kno wn interest rate parity relationship from international 
nance. To understand the relationship, suppose rst that F0 &gt;S0

We can see that the swap rate so is, in fact, the par rate of a coupon 
bearing bond. That is, so is the coupon rate of a bond sold at par.</text>

The value of a forward contract at the time it is rst entered into is 
zero. At a later stage it may prove to have a positive or negativ e value. 
Suppose that f is the value today of a long forward contract that has 
a delivery price of K and hat F0 is the curren t forward price for the 
contract. A general result, applicable to a forward contract on either an 
investmen t or consumption asset, is: 
rTf =(F0  K) e (15) 
where, as usual, T is the time to maturit y of the contract and r is the 
risk-free rate for a maturit y T . To see why equation ?? is correct, we 
compare a long forward contract has a delivery price of K. The dier
ence between the two is only in the amoun t that will be paid for the 
underlying asset at time T . Under the st contract this amoun t is F0; 
under the second contract it is K. A cash ow dierence of F0  K at 
time T translates to a dierence of (F0  K) erT today. The contract 
with a delivery price F0 is, therefore, less valuable than the contract with 
delivery price K by an amoun t (F0  K)  erT . The value of the con-
tract that has a delivery price of F0 is by denition zero. It follows that 
the value of the contract with a delivery price of K is (F0  K)  erT . 
This proves equation ??. Similarly , the value of a short forward contract 
with delivery price K is: 
rT(K  F0)  e (16) 
Equation ?? shows that we can value a long forward contract on an asset 
by assuming that the price of the asset at the maturit y of the forward 
contract is the forward price, F0. This is because, when we can make</text>

          <text>The Growth of the Swap Market
Almost all swaps are traded over-the-coun ter (OTC). However, ex-
changes are now trying to list swaps. 
Swaps usually go out from 2 years up to 10 years. This is called 
the tenor of the swap. 
It was estimated by the International Swap Dealers Association 
(ISDA) that as of June 30, 1997 about US$23.7 trillion worth of 
currency and interest rate swaps notional value existed, of which 
more than 93% comprise interest rate swaps. (Source: ISDAs Web 
Page at http://www.isda.org/) 
Initially , banks acted as intermediaries trying to match a swap buyer 
with a seller. Over time, banks emerged as counterparties to swaps 
as they learned to lay o their risk using other derivatives such as 
exchange-traded futures. This is known as warehousing and the 
transactions are referred to as matc hed-book trading. 
Using futures to hedge swap books is cost-eectiv e but results in 
hedging complexities due to the non-linear relationship between the 
swap book, which is a portfolio of forward contracts (to be shown!), 
and futures contracts. Recall, there is a slight dierence between 
forward and futures contracts. We defer this discussion to the end 
of this handout.</text>

Swaptions are options on interest rate swaps. 
An in- for T Europ ean swaption is a contract that gives the holder
the right, not the obligation, to enter a T year swap at some future date
at a pre known rate K. Let s be the time- T-year swap rate. The

(s  K)+P /2(payers swaption) ,

dollars) at every settlemen t date (e.g., every 6 months). Since the 
spot exchange rate at each settlemen t date is random, the dollar 
value of the foreign currency unit is also random. If this dierence 
is negativ e, the swap buyer pays the absolute value of the dierence 
to the swap seller. 
Similarly , in an equity index swap, the buyer receiv es the dier
ence between the dollar value of a stock index and a xed amoun t 
of dollars at every settlemen t date. 
The most common type of swap is an interest rate swap. The buyer 
of an interest rate swap receiv es the dierence between the interest 
computed using a oating interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) and the inter
est computed using a xed interest rate (e.g., 5% per 6 months) at 
every settlemen t date (e.g., every 6 months). The interest is com
puted by reference to a notional principal (e.g., $100 mio.), which 
never changes hands. 
If the oating side of an equity index or interest rate swap is calcu
lated by reference to an index or interest rate in a foreign country, 
then there is currency risk, in addition to the usual equity or interest 
rate risk. 
If the currency is negativ ely correlated with the underlying, this 
currency risk is actually desirable. Nonetheless, many swap con-
tracts are quoted with a xed currency component, so that only the 
equity or interest rate risk remains.</text>

          <text>Example of an Interest-Rate Swap
This example is drawn from Hull, pages 147-149. 
Assume A wants a oating rate loan. Usually the oating rate loan 
is pegged at LIBOR of a particular term (+ spread). The LIBOR 
term is set equal to the settlemen t date periodicity. For example, if 
settlemen t is every six months, the oating rate is six-mon th spot 
LIBOR (prevailing over the next six months). 
Assume B wants a xed rate loan. Usually the xed rate loan is 
pegged at the yield-to-maturit y of the Treasury securit y of the swap 
tenor (+ spread). 
The (non-sw ap) borrowing structure for Parties A and B is as fol
lows: 
S&amp;P Credit Rating Party Fixed (%) Floating (%) 
AA A 10 LIBOR +0.3
BBB B 11.2 LIBOR + 1.0
Gain: BA 1.2 0.7
We say B has a comparativ e advantage in oating rate loans. Hence,
it can oer a oating rate loan to A. Similarly , A can oer a
xed rate loan to B. These oers, using an interest rate swap, beat
the rates at which they can borrow by going to the market for loans
directly .
Comparativ e advantage gain = (1.2 -0.7)% = 0.5 % (50 b.p.). Note:</text>

IBM in 1980.

payments on an issue of intermediate term, xed rate debt for oat

Assuming the face values of Party As and Bs liabilities (i.e., their 
short positions in xed rate and oating rate bonds, respectively) 
are $100M each, the notional principal value of the swap can be set 
at $100M, too. This notional principal never changes hands. 
Net Result: 
 B borrows at: 
(LIBOR + 1%) -LIBOR + xed = 10.95% 
xed leg of swap = 9.95% 
(Note: 10.95% was obtained by subtracting Party Bs swap gain 
of 25 b.p. from its xed rate (non-sw ap) loan of 11.2%) 
 Therefore, A borrows at:

          <text>Interest Rate Derivatives
Interest rate swaps, caps, oors, and swaptions are over the counter 
(OTC) interest rate derivatives. 
Broadly dened, a derivative instrumen t is a formal agreemen t between 
two parties specifying the exchange of cash payments based on changes 
in the price of a specied underlying item or dierences in the returns 
of dieren t securities. 
For example, interest rate swaps are based on dierences be-tween two 
dieren t interest rates, while interest rate caps/o ors are option like in
strumen ts on interest rates. 
Unlike the organized exchanges, the OTC market is an informal mar
ket consisting of dealers or market makers, who trade price information 
and negotiate transactions over electronic comm unications networks. 
Although a great deal of contract standardization exists in the OTC 
market, dealers active in this market custom tailor agreemen ts to meet 
the specic needs of their customers. 
And unlike the organized exchanges, where the exchange clearinghouses 
guaran tee contract performance through a system of margin require
ments combined with the daily settlemen t of gains or losses, counterpar
ties to OTC derivative agreemen ts must bear some default or credit risk.</text>

          <text>Swaptions and Caps
Caps and swaptions are generally traded as separate products in the 
nancial markets, and the models used to value caps are typically dif
ferent from those used to value swaptions. 
Furthermore, most Wall Street rms use a piecemeal approac h to cali
brating their models for caps and swaptions, making it dicult to eval
uate whether these derivatives are fairly priced relativ e to each other. 
Financial theory , however, implies no arbitrage relations for the cap and 
swaption prices. 
A cap can be represen ted as a portfolio of options on individual for-
ward rates. In contrast, a swaption can be viewed as an option on the 
forward swap rate, which is a portfolio of individual forward rates. 
This implies that the relation between cap and swaption prices is driven 
primarily by the correlation structure of forward rates.</text>

 Short a forward contract on one unit of the foreign currency . 
The holding in the foreign currency grows to unit at time T because of 
the interest earned. Under the terms of the forward contract, the hold
ing is exchanged for F0 at time T . An amoun t S0  errf T is required to 
repay the borrowing. A net prot of F0  S0  errf T , is therefore, made 
at time T . 
Suppose next that F0 &lt;S0  errf T . An investor can: 
 Borrow erf T in the foreign currency at rate r for time T . 
 Use the cash to buy S0  erf T of the domestic currency and invest 
this at the domestic risk-free rate. 
 Take a long position in a forward contract on one unit of the foreign 
currency . 
In this case, the holding in the domestic currency grows to S0  errf T 
at time T because of the interest earned. At time T the investor pays 
F0 and receiv es one unit of the foreign currency . The latter is used to 
repay the borrowings. A net prot of S0  errf T  F0, is therefore, made 
at time T . 
Note that equation is identical to equation (??) with q replaced by rf . 
This is not a coincidence. A foreign currency can be regarded as in in-
vestmen t asset paying a known dividend yield. The dividend yield is 
the risk-free rate of interest in the foreign currency . To see why this is 
so, note that interest earned on a foreign currency holding is denomi
nated in the foreign currency . Its value when measured in the domestic 
currency is therefore proportional to the value of the foreign currency .</text>

We can generalize the valuation of a forward contract with no income as 
following: 
rTF0 = S0  e (17) 
We can generalize to argue that, when an investmen t asset will provide 
income with a presen t value of I during the life of a forward contract: 
rTF0 =(S0  I)  e (18) 
The forward price for an investmen t asset providing a continuous divi

          <text>Swaptions Valuation 
At the exercise date  , the moneyness of the swaption depends 
on the T year swap rate sT , at time  , which is unkno wn at time 
0. 
The usual approac h (the Black-Model) is to assume that the 
swap rate s , is log-normal. The pricing formula is very similar 
to that of Black and Scholes. 
The value of the swaption depends on the distribution, in par
ticular, the volatilit y of s . 
If the future swap rate s , is known for certain at time 0, then 
the swaption is worthless.</text>

          <text>The History of Swaps
A swap contract is an obligation to pay a xed amoun t and receiv e a 
oating amoun t at the end of every period for a pre-sp ecied number 
of periods. 
Each date on which payments are made is called a settlemen t date. 
If the xed amoun t exceeds the oating amoun t on a settlemen t 
date, the buyer of the swap pays the seller the dierence in cash. If 
the oating amoun t exceeds the xed amoun t on a settlemen t date, 
the seller of the swap pays the buyer the dierence in cash. In ei
ther case, this dierence is conveyed in the form of a dierence check. 
A swap contract is equivalent to a portfolio of forward contracts 
with identical delivery prices and dieren t maturities. Consequen tly, 
swap contracts are similar to forwards in that: 
 at any date, swap contracts can have positive, negativ e, or no 
value. 
 at initiation, the xed amoun t paid is chosen so that the swap 
contract is costless. The unique xed amoun t which zeros out 
the value of a swap contract is called the swap price.</text>

          <text>According to data released by BIS, the total estimated notional amoun t 
of outstanding OTC contracts stood at $94 trillion at end June 2000. 
The interest segmen t expanded by 7%, to $64.1 trillion. 
 The total notional amoun t of interest rate swaps is $48 trillion, 
among which, $17 trillion goes to USD swaps. 
 At the same time, the total public debt (including Treasuries and 
local governmen t debt) outstanding in the U.S. is $5 trillion. 
 The total notional amoun t of interest rate options is 9 trillion.</text>

          <text>Construction of the Spot Rate Curve
Several dieren t sets of Treasures can be used to construct a default-free 
theoretical spot rate curve: 
 On-the-run Treasury: The newest Treasury issues. Bootstrapping 
used to get the dieren t yields. 
 On-the-run Treasury issues and selected o-the-run Treasury issues: 
helps to avoid a large maturit y gap in the on-the-run Treasuries. 
Note there is a tax eect for Treasuries not selling at par-the par 
coupon curve uses adjusted yields and linear interpolation to obtain 
the yield curve. Bootstrapping used to get the dieren t yields. 
 All treasury coupon securities and bills: All are used in the hope that 
they contain additional information relativ e to the above. here it is 
not possible to use bootstrapping as there may exist several yields 
for each maturit y (uses instead exponential spline tting). 
 Treasury coupon strips: are observ able zero/coup on securities but 
are normally not used as they include a liquidit y premium and 
are associated with tax aspects even more complicated than those 
mentioned above. 
Compute spot rates from the par yield curve (bootstrapping): 
1. Get the prices on some usable bonds either directly or by using their 
YTM. 
N CPNt PAR2. Use t=1 (1+S t)t + (1+S N )N to get the spot rate, St one by one, rst 
solve for S1 and then use S1 to solve for S2 and so on. 
3. Often the book argues that in step 3 we have to strip the coupons 
from the bond and value them as stand-alone instrumen ts -but I 
nd it easier to do everything as describ ed in step 2.</text>

          <text>Caps and Floors
An interest rate cap gives the buyer the right, not the obligation, to 
receiv e the dierence in the interest cost (on some notional amoun t) any 
time a specied index of market interest rates rises above a stipulated 
cap rate. 
Caps evolved from interest rate guaran tees that xed a maxim um level 
of interest payable on oating rate loans. 
The advent of trading in over the counter interest rate caps dates back 
to 1985, when banks began to strip such guaran tees from oating rate 
notes to sell to the market. 
The leveraged buyout boom of the 1980s spurred the evolution of the 
market for interest rate caps. Firms engaged in leveraged buyouts typ
ically took on large quantities of short term debt, which made them 
vulnerable to nancial distress in the event of a rise in interest rates. 
As a result, lenders began requiring such borrowers to buy interest rate 
caps to reduce the risk of nancial distress. 
Similar in structure to a cap, an interest rate oor gives the buyer the 
right to receiv e the dierence in the interest cost any time a specied 
index of market interest rates falls below a stipulated oor rate.</text>

          <text>Spot and forward rates
With annual coupon payments, the Yield to Maturit y (YTM) is dened 
by: 
N CPNt PAR Bond P rice = + (1 + YTM )t (1 + YTM )N (5) 
t=1 
= Present V alue of future payments (YTM ) 
Shortcomings of YTM valuation when the yield curve is not at: 
 all cash ows are discoun ted at a single rate; 
 all cash ows are assumed to be reinvested at the YTM. 
Spot rates: All cash ows occuring at the same time must have the 
same required yield (given that they have the same issuer): 
N CPNt PAR Bond P rice = + (1 + S)t (1 + S)N (6) 
t=1 
= Present V alue of future payments (St) 
Forward rates: The future short rates, at which you can place your 
money today (by buying a forward contract on the appropriate bond). 
If we again only consider yearly payments and St is the spot rate for 
year t, and where nfm is n-year the forward rate between year m and 
year m + n, then we have: 
(1 + S2)2 = (1+ S1)  (1 + 1f1)  1f1 = (1+ S2)2 
 1 (7)(1 + S1) 
Argumen t: We should expect to have the same return whether we now 
buy the 2 year bond or now buy a bond that matures in a year and use 
the money receiv ed from this bond to pay the forward price for a bond</text>

          <text>The Assumption of Complete Market
Although it is not an explicit assumption made by the Black Scholes, 
market is dynamically complete with respect to the underlying stocks 
and the riskfree account. 
The intuition is that there is only one source of uncertainty (associ -
ated with the Brownian motion), which can be fully reected by the 
underlying stock prices. 
If in addition to the Brownian shocks, there are jump risks in the un-
derlying stock, then the market is no longer complete. 
Similarly situation arises if the stock volatility has random shocks of 
its own. 
In both cases, investors aversion to the additional sources of uncertain 
will be reected in option prices.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>5</slideno>
          <text>The Assumption of Constant Volatility
The fact that volatility is not constant can be seen from both the un-
derlying stock market and the options market. 
In fact, volatility is itself a stochastic process. For example, letting 
Vt = t 2, a popular stochastic volatility model is: 
vdV t = k V Vt dt + VtdBt (3) 
Some empirical regularities: 
1. volatility is stochastic (random); 
2. volatility is persistent; 
3. volatility is mean-reverting; 
4. the volatility shocks are negatively correlated with the underlying 
price shocks. 
For each regularity, can you provide a relevant empirical evidence from 
the options market?</text>

          <text>The Black Scholes Model
Stock prices follow a geometric Brownian motion. Translating into dis-
crete time, stock prices follow a Random Walk: 
  
rt+ t =   t +   t+ t (1) 
This model implies that, over time interval t stock returns are normally 
 
distributed with standard deviation  t. 
The market is dynamically complete. Options are redundant, and can 
be replicated by a dynamic hedging strategy that involves the riskfree 
account r and the underlying stock S. 
The Black-Scholes formula for a call option struck at K and expiring 
at T: 
C0 BS = BS (S0,K,T, ,r f ) (2)

stock a, and the riskfree rate rf .</text>

          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>Evidence against the Black &amp; Scholes
The Black-Scholes implied volatility does not stay constant over time. 
The volatility implied by the options market is on average higher than 
that observed directly from the underlying stock market. 
On any given day, options (both puts and calls) with dierent K and 
T exhibit a pattern of smile or smirk: 
 OTM puts have higher implied-vol than ATM options and OTM 
calls. 
 This smile pattern is more pronounced in short-dated options. 
 The volatility implied by long-dated options diers from that implied 
by short-dated options.</text>

          <text>Fear of Jumps
The options market, especially that of OTM puts, provides a unique op-
portunity for investors to express their aversion to negative price jumps. 
The market prices of such OTM puts reect not only the probability 
and magnitude of such jumps, but also investors aversion to such jumps. 
This aversion to negative jump risks is closely related to the aversion 
to negative skewness. 
Just like backing out Black-Scholes implied volatility, one can back out 
the probability and magnitude of negative jumps from OTM puts. 
It is found that option-implied jump risks are much exaggerated in com-
parison with those observed directly from the spot market (Jun Pan 
2001), why?</text>

          <text>Summary
The Black-Scholes model provides a powerful framework for us to for-
mulate option pricing. 
The Black-Schole formula provides a powerful tool for us to measure 
the sensitivity of option prices with respect to the market condition. 
To option traders, such sensitivity measures are as essential, if not more, 
as breathing air in and out. 
There is mounting evidence, from both the underlying stock market and 
the options market, suggesting that the assumptions of the Black Sc-
holes are overly simplied. 
In this class, we examined the eect of stochastic volatility, price jumps, 
and fear of jumps.

          <text>The Assumption of No Jump
The fact that stock prices experience sudden jumps can be seen from 
both the underlying stock market and the options market (why?). 
Price is continuous in the Black Scholes: 
  
rt+ t =   t +   t+ t (4) 
 
As we shrink the time interval t to zero, the volatility  t of the 
surprise component also shrinks to zero. 
In 1976, three years after the Black Scholes, Bob Merton proposed 
a jump extension. 
  
rt+ t =   t +   t+ t + Jt+ t (5) 
Can you provide the relevant empirical evidence from the options market 
indicating negative price jumps in the underlying?</text>

          <text>Implications of the Black &amp; Scholes
The Black-Scholes volatilities implied by options with dierence strike 
prices K and maturities T should be the same. They should also remain 
constant over time. 
The volatility implied by options should be consistent with the level 
of volatility observed in the underlying stock market.</text>

          <text>The Assumptions
1. Constant riskfree borrowing and lend rate rf . 
2. The underlying asset can be continuously traded with no transactions costs, no 
short sale constraints, perfectly divisible, and no taxes. 
3. We assume no dividends, but this restriction can be relaxed. 
4. The price of the underlying asset follows a Geometric Brownian Motion: 
dSt =   dt +   dBt (29)St 
This model is the continuous time version of the random walk model we have studied 
in Class 9. The increment Bt of a Brownian motion is normally distributed with 
mean zero and variance t.</text>

          <text>Spanning the Payos
Consider a portfolio of m0 shares of the underlying stock and B0 dollars invested in the 
riskless asset, Assume you form the portfolio at time 0. The portfolio has two possible 
values at the end of the period, depending on whether the stock price goes up or down: 
Up : m0  80 + B0  1.25 (6) 
Down : m0  20 + B0  1.25 (7) 
Similarly, the call value has two possible values: 
Up: 30 or Down: 0 
We can choose the number of shares, m0, and the amount invested in the riskless asset, 
B0, today, so that the value of the stock-bond portfolio equates to the value of the call 
next year: 
1.m 0  80 + B0  1.25 = 30 
2.m 0  20 + B0  1.25 = 0 
Subtracting (2) from (1) and solving for the number of shares, m0,w eg e t 
30  0 1 m0 = = (8)80  20 2 
Plugging for m0 into either (1) or (2), we get B0 = 8$. The minus sign for B0 means 
we have to borrow $8 at the riskless rate.</text>

Strike Price Intervals: Five points. 25-point intervals for far months. 
Strike (Exercise) Prices: In-,at- and out-of-the-money strike prices are initially listed. 
New series are generally added when the underlying trades through the highest or low-
est strike price available. 
Premium Quotation: Stated in decimals. One point equals $100. Minimum tick for 
options trading below 3.00 is 0.05 ($5.00) and for all other series, 0.10 ($10.00). 
Expiration Date: Saturday immediately following the third Friday of the expiration 
month. 
Expiration Months: Three near-term months followed by three additional months from 
the March quarterly cycle (March, June, September and December). 
Exercise Style: European - SPX options generally may be exercised only on the last 
business day be-fore expiration. 
Settlement of Option Exercise: The exercise-settlement value, SET, is calculated us-
ing the opening (rst) reported sales price in the primary market of each component 
stock on the last business day (usually a Friday) before the expiration date. If a stock 
in the index does not open on the day on which the exercise &amp; settlement value is 
determined, the last reported sales price in the primary market will be used in calcu-
lating the exercise-settlement value. The exercise-settlement amount is equal to the 
dierence between the exercise-settlement value, SET, and the exercise price of the 
option, multiplied by $100. Exercise will result in delivery of cash on the business day 
following expiration. 
Position and Exercise Limits: No position and exercise limits are in eect. Each mem-
ber (other than a market-maker) or member organization that maintains an end of day 
position in excess of 100,000 contracts in SPX (10 SPX LEAPS equals 1 SPX full value

          <text>What is the Intuition?
If there is only one source of uncertainty in the underlying stock, then the eect of the 
random shock is fully reected in the underlying stock price. 
In such a setting, option becomes redundant. 
Investors are risk averse: they are worried about the systematic random uctuations 
in the stock price. This fear is fully ex-pressed when investors price the underlying 
security. 
When it comes to price options, investors are already at a comfortable level regarding 
risk and reward. Options, being redundant in this setting, provide no additional infor-
mation about the risk or the reward. 
There is no assumption about investors being risk neutral. Risk neutral pricing is 
a trick to simplify option pricing.</text>

          <text>Option Pricing
Suppose the underlying security does not pay dividend, 
rT = ln (ST )  ln (SO ) (1) 
or equivalently:   
S0 = Eer i,T  ST (2) 
A call option paying (ST  K)+ at time T must be worth: 
C0 = Eer i,T  (ST  K)+ (3) 
From the intuition of the CAPM, we know that the above evaluation depends on the 
risk aversion coecient A of the representative investor. For example, if the underlying 
asset is the market portfolio, then 
E (rT )  rf = A var (rT ) (4) 
The question is: how to evaluate 
C0 = Eer i,T  (ST  K)+ (5)</text>

          <text>Why Options?
Hedging, (speculative) investing, and asset allocation are among the top reasons for 
option trading. 
In essence, options and other derivatives provide a tailored service of risk by slic-
ing, reshaping, and re packaging the existing risks in the underlying security. 
The risks are still the same, but investors can choose to take on dierent aspects 
of the existing risks in the underlying asset.

          <text>The Options Market and Volatility
A casual inspection of the options market leads one to believe that stock volatility does 
not stay constant over time. Why? 
Investors express their view on the future market volatility by trading options. 
Eectively, the equity options market serves as an information central, collecting up-
dates about the future market volatility: 
 short dated options: near term volatility; 
 long dated options: long term volatility.

          <text>Valuation
Since buying 1 of a share of the stock and shorting $8 of the risk-less asset duplicates 2 
the payo of the all, avoiding arbitrage requires that the current price of the traded call 
1equals the cost of duplicating it. Hence, the current call value is: V (0) = 2  $40  $8 =
$12.
Remarks:
1	The required number of shares, m0 = 2 , is the dierence in next years possible 
call values, expressed as a proportion of the dierence in next years possible stock 
prices: 
30  0 1 m0 = =	 ( 9 ) 80  20 2 
	For a European call option, the required number of shares is always between 0 
and 1. In a graph of call values against stock prices, the required number of shares 
is the slope of the graph. For this reason, the required number of shares is often 
called the delta of the call. Delta is the sensitivity of the call option price to stock 
price changes. It is a very useful parameter in hedging. The amount invested in 
the riskless asset is negative (B0 = $8). Consequently, the riskless bond must be 
shorted. Short selling bonds is equivalent to borrowing. The amount to be repaid 
at the end of the period is (B0  1.25) = $10, irrespective of being in the up state 
or down state. 
	This approach can be used in a binomial framework to value any claim whose 
payo is contingent on the price of the stock (e.g., a put). 
	Notice that the probabilities q and 1q do not enter the valuation argument at all. 
Hence, 2 individuals who disagree about the probabilities of outcomes (q, 1  q), 
but who agree on the outcomes (i.e., U and D), will agree that the traded options 
value today is 12. 
	Since we assume that the stock can only take on two values from any node, we 
only need two assets (the underlyer and the riskless asset) to replicate the payo of 
the option. Any additional uncertainty (example, stochastic interest rates) would 
require additional assets.</text>

          <text>Equity Options: The Basics
A European style call option is the right to purchase, on a future date T, one unit of 
the underlying asset at a pre determined price K: 
 At time 0 (today), pay C. 
 At time T (the expiration date), exercise the option and get (ST  K)+. 
A put option gives the right to sell: 
 At time 0 (today), pay P. 
 At time T, get (K  ST )+. 
Most of the index options (e.g., SPX, QEX, NDX) are European style. All of the 
options on the individual stocks are American style, which allow for exercise before the

Problem
Suppose that a European call option struck at $ 50 matures in one year (t =1 ) . T h e 
riskless rate per year is 25%, compounded annually, so that one dollar invested at the 
riskless rate grows to $ 1.25 over the year. The stock underlying the option pays no 
dividends over the year and its current price of $ 40 will either double or halve over 
the year. Assuming frictionless markets and no arbitrage, what must be the current 
price of the call, C0? 
	Strike Price of the call = K = $ 50 
	Riskless return over the period = R(1) = 1.25 
	Unit Bond price = B(0, 1) = 1.1
25 =$ 0.80 
	Stock price at the beginning of the period = S0 = $40 
	Up return of the stock = U =2 
	Down return of the stock = D = 1 
2 
	Call value at the end of the period given an Up return of the stock = CU = 
max[0,S 0  U  K] = $30 
	Call value at the end of the period given a down return of the stock = CD = 
max[0,S 0  D  K]=$ 0 
	Call value at the beginning of the period = C0 =? (Ans: $ 12. The next section 
will derive the price).</text>

          <text>Put/Call Parity
c  p = S  er(T T )  K p u t  call parity 
The value of the call minus the value for the put is equal to the value for the stock 
minus the present value of K. 
We have two investments: 
1. Buy the call option and sell the put option. Value: c  p 
2. Go long the stock and sell a riskless, zero-coupon bond maturing at time T to K. 
Value: S  er(T t)  K 
Neither of these instruments incur any costs during their lifetime. Lets examine their 
values at time T, starting with investment one, the long-call, short-put investment. 
Since the call and the put have the same strike, at expiration either the call will be in 
the money or the put will be in the money - but never both. Write ST for the value 
for the stock at time T. If the call is in the money, the payo is ST  K, since the 
position is long. On the other hand, if the short put is in the money, the its payo is 
(K  ST )= ST  K. That is, since the position is short, its payo is the negative of 
the usual K  ST , independent of the stock price at Time T. 
The second investment, the stock-bond portfolio is comparatively easy to value. At 
time T, the bond will have matured to a value of K, and therefore the long-stock, 
short-bond position will have a value of ST  K. Both investments have the same value 
at time T, and moreover, cost nothing to maintain. Therefore, our basic arbitrage 
argument tells us the investments must have the same initial value, that is: 
c  p = S  e r(T t)  K     (35) 
value of investment 1 value of investment 2 c  p = St z  K  B (t, T ) (33) 
= max [0,St z  K  B (t, T )]  max [0,K  B(t, T )  St z ] . (34)</text>

Valuation by Duplication is the reason why risk-neutral valuation works. The same 
idea can be used for puts and for multiple periods. Risk-neutral valuation permits 
very quick calculation of option values. Risk-neutral valuation, hence, simplies the 
valuation problem (compared to valuation by duplication which was mighty cumber -
some for multiple periods). Furthermore, the composition of the duplicating portfolio 
is easily calculated once the option values are known. Armed with the risk-neutral 
probabilities  and 1  , we can duplicate and price anything. For example, to dupli-
cate a contingent claim paying XU dollars if the spot price goes up and XD dollars if 
the spot price goes down, we use risk-neutral valuation to calculate the current price 
of the contingent claim as: 
1 r  [  XU +( 1  )  XD ] (15) f 
which is interpreted as the discounted expected payo under risk-neutrality. Example: 
Recall (see previous page) for 1-period calls, 
1 +  c0 = rf    c1 +( 1  )  c1 (16) 
where XU = C1+ and XD = C1 . If we think of XU and XD as option values in successor 
nodes, then we have a recipe for valuing in multiple periods as illustrated next. Note: 
The risk neutral probabilities  and 1   are usually referred to also as the equivalent 
martingale probabilities.</text>

          <text>Risk Neutral Pricing
It turns out that Black was not far from the truth! 
	Two hypothetical investors: one risk neutral (A = 0), and one risk averse (A&gt;0). 
	Suppose both investors are willing to pay the market price S0 for the underlying 
asset. 
But their required rates of return are dierent: 
	For the risk neutral investor, it is simply the riskfree rate rf . 
	For the risk averse, it is the riskfree rate rf plus a positive risk premium. 
	If they agreed on So, they would also agree on C0 for the call. If this is true, the 
easiest way to get C0 is to let the risk neutral investor do the pricing. Hence the 
term risk neutral pricing. 
One key assumption: All investors, regardless of their risk attitudes, agree on todays 
stock price S0.</text>

          <text>The Option Implied Volatility
At time 0, a call option struck at K and expiring on date T is traded at C0.A t t h e 
same time, the underlying stock price is traded at S0, and the riskfree rate is rf . 
If we know the market volatility at time 0, we can apply the Black Scholes formula: 
C0 = BS(S0,K,T, ,r f ) (36) BS 
Volatility is something that we dont observe directly. But using the market observed 
price C0, we can back it out: 
C0 = BS S0,K,T,I ,rf (37) 
If the Black Scholes model is the correct model, then the Option Implied Volatility I 
should be exactly the same as the true volatility .</text>

c Risk-Neutral Valuation
Risk neutral valuation is a trick for valuing options quickly when investors can be risk-
averse. It is not a model which assumes investors are all risk-neutral. 
Recall that the version of the binomial model we studied assumed frictionless markets, 
no arbitrage, European options, a constant riskless rate, no payouts, and a multiplica -
tive binomial process for the underlyers spot price. 
We were able to value a European call and put without any knowledge of investor 
preferences or beliefs regarding the likelihood of the up or down states. This is called 
Valuation by Duplication. 
Since the same value results regardless of investor preferences, we can pretend that 
investors are risk-neutral as an aid in calculating values. 
In this case, the expected return on the underlyer is the riskless return rf . Letting  
denote the risk-neutral probability of an up jump, we have: 
1 St =  [  St  U +( 1  )  St  D] (10) rf 
implying 
  U +( 1  )  D = rf (11) 
or equivalently 
 = rf  D (12) U  D 
Under risk-neutrality, the expected payo of a 1-period call is:
+
1 =( 1  )  c1 (13) c 
where recall: 
+
1 0,S
+
1 K is the call value in the up state = max 
 1 0,S1 K is the call value in the down state = max 
rf D = is the risk-neutral probability of an up jump found by equating the expected U D 
return from the underlying to the riskless return. 
In a risk-neutral world, the expected return on an option is also the riskless return. 
Thus, the initial call value c0 is given by discounting the above expected payo at the</text>

          <text>Consider a scenario in which the U.S. dollar has strengthened dramati
cally, say 20%. At current levels of foreign revenue, the 20% strength
ening in U.S. dollar translates into an unexpected shortfall of about 
$1 billion in revenues. Management is not to blame for uctuations 
in foreign currency markets. Exchange rates are dicult to predict, af
ter correcting for dierences between domestic and foreign interest rates. 
Managers, however, will be expected to deal with the immense amount 
of shortfall represented by this sort of scenario: 
1. Are dividends to be cut? 
2. What R&amp;D program? How will it be funded? 
Funding all positive NPV projects and at the same time maintaining 
stable dividends in this scenario could call for issuing new debt. 
Not only are debt underwriting costs considerable, crucial information 
regarding the protability of the R&amp;D program is likely to be unknown 
by potential bond investors. 
This means that the rate of return demanded by outside bond investors 
may include an extra risk premium for the information that they do not 
hold. 
In other words, what might have been a positive NPV project, when 
funded with retained earnings, may now be a negative NPV project, 
when funded with new debt, and may therefore be dropped. 
Finally, shareholders may not be aware that weak earnings are due to</text>

Hedging using Index Futures 
Stock index futures can be used to hedge the risk in a (usually well-
diversied) portfolio or individual stocks (individual stock-futures work 
better for some specic stocks). We will use  as the coecient from 
the CAPM and the regression. This is the slope of the best-t line ob
tained when the excess return on the portfolio over the risk-free rate is 
regressed against the excess return on the market over the riskfree rate. 
When  =1.0, the return on the portfolio tends to mirror the return of 
the market; when  =2.0, the excess return on the portfolio tends to 
be twice as great as the excess return on the market; when  =0.5, it 
tends to be half as great; and so on. 
When the  of the portfolio equals 1, the position in futures contracts 
should be chosen so that the value for the stocks underlying the futures 
contacts equals the total value of the portfolio being hedge. When  =2 , 
the portfolio is twice as volatile as the stocks underlying the futures con
tract and the position in futures contacts should be twice as great. When</text>

          <text>The Leverage of Financial Firms
Compared with other types of corporations, nancial rms have rela
tively liquid balance sheets, made up largely of nancial positions. 
This relative liquidity allows a typical nancial rm to operate with 
a high degree of leverage. 
For example, major broker-dealers regulated by SEC frequently have 
a level of accounting capital that is close to the regulatory minimum of 
8% of account assets, implying a leverage ratio on the order of 12 to 1. 
Ironically, in light of the relatively high degree of liquidity that fosters 
high leverage, a signicant and sudden nancial loss (or reduced access 
to credit) can cause dramatic illiquidity eects.</text>

          <text>The Economics of Risk Management
The economics of risk management for nancial rms is far from an ex
act science. 
While rigorous and empirically testable models can be brought to the 
task of measuring nancial risks, some of the benets and costs of bear
ing these risks are dicult to quantify. 
In a hypothetical world of perfect capital markets, adding or subtract
ing nancial risk has no impact on the market value of a publicly traded 
corporation or on the welfare of its shareholders. 
We can certainly agree, however, that capital markets are not perfect, 
and that market imperfections underly signicant benets to bearing 
and controlling nancial risks. 
It is dicult to quantify the costs and benets in bearing/controlling 
risk. So, rather than a recipe providing in each case the appropriate 
amount of each type of risk to be borne in light of the costs and benets, 
one should aim for a critical review of the nature of risks, the channels 
through which they can be measured and mitigated. 
An appropriate appetite for risk is ultimately a matter of judgment that 
is informed by quantitative models for measuring risk and based on a 
conceptual understanding of the implications of risk.</text>

          <text>Stock Index Futures
A stock index tracks changes int he value of a hypothetical portfolio of 
stocks. The weight of a stock in the portfolio equals the proportion of 
the portfolio invested in the stock. The percentage increase in the stock 
index over a small interval of time is set equal to the percentage increase 
in the value of the hypothetical portfolio. Dividends are usually not in
cluded in the calculation so that the index tracks the capital gain/loss 
from investing in the portfolio.1 
If the hypothetical portfolio of stocks remains xed, the weights assigned 
to individual stocks in the portfolio do not remain xed. When the price 
of one particular stock in the portfolio rises more sharply than others, 
more weight is automatically given to that stock. Some indices are con

Financial Background 
As of 1994, Merck had been an extremely protable rm with a low 
debt load (the debt/equity ratio is under 2%). 
There is no nancial distress on the horizon, essentially eliminating that 
as a motive for hedging. 
For 1994, Mercks sales were $15 billion, of which 32% were foreign. 
Sales were enhanced by 1% in dollar terms in 1994 by changes in foreign 
exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency prices reduced earnings by 2% 
in 1993. 
R&amp;D expenditures in 1994 were $ 1.2 billion.

          <text>Capital - A Scarce Resource
If new capital could be obtained in perfect nancial markets, we would 
expect a nancial rm to raise capital as necessary to avoid the costs of 
nancial distress. 
In such a setting, purely nancial risk would have a relatively small 
impact, and risk management would likewise be less important. 
In fact, however, externally raised capital tends to be more costly than 
retained earnings as a source of funding. 
External providers of capital tend to be less well informed about the 
rms earnings prospects , charging the rm a lemons premium that 
reects their informational disadvantage. 
They might also be concerned that the rms managers have their own 
agenda, and may not use the capital eciently. 
A Brief Zoology of Risks 
The risks faced by nancial institutions fall largely into the following 
broad categories: 
 Market Risk - unexpected changes in prices or rates. 
 Credit Risk - changes in value associated with unexpected changes 
in credit quality. 
 Liquidity Risk - the risk of increased costs, or inability to adjust</text>

dene:
P portfolio value;
F value of assets underlying one futures contract.
The correct number of contracts to short in order to hedge the risk
in the portfolio is:
P   (27)F 
The formula assumes that the maturity of the futures contract is close to 
the maturity of the hedge and ignores the daily settlement of the futures 
contract. 
Example: A company wishes to hedge a portfolio worth $ 2100000 
over the next three months using an S&amp;P 500 index futures contract 
with four months to maturity. The current level of the S&amp;P 500 is 900 
and the  of the portfolio 1.5. The value of the assets underlying one 
futures contract is 900  250 = $225/prime000. The correct number of futures 
contracts to short is, therefore: 
2/prime100/prime000 1.5  = 14 (28) 225/prime000 
To show that the hedge works, we suppose the risk-free rate is 4% per 
year and the market provides a total return of -7% in the course of the 
next three months. This is bad news for the portfolio. The risk-free rate 
is 1% per three months so that the return on the market is 8% below 
the risk-free rate. We therefore expect the return (including dividends)</text>

          <text>Introduction
The recent, notable increase in focus on nancial risks can be traced 
in part to the concerns of regulatory and investors about risk exposure 
of nancial institutions through their large positions in OTC derivatives. 
The dramatic increase in the availability and usage of derivative products 
can be traced to several developments: 
 1. Because of the rapid improvement in nancial modelling and com
puter systems, complex derivatives can be oered at more favorable 
prices and liquidity. 
 2. With the liberalization of nancial markets around the world, 
the demand for more sophisticated hedging instruments with wider 
coverage range has also increased. 
There certainly have been periods of high volatility in the nancial mar
ket, but what distinguishes the recent period from earlier periods is that 
investors have had lower cost access to derivatives that permit highly 
leveraged positions and, hence, potentially large changes in value for a 
given change in the value of the underlying instrument. The recent losses 
on derivative positions, by both nancial and non-nancial corporations, 
are clear manifestations of this eect.</text>

          <text>Accounting Issues
Consider a 750 million Euro put option hedge against a 1 billion Swiss 
franc receivable on next years sales. 
Suppose the puts expire in one year, and were purchased for about 7.5 
million dollars. Suppose the market value of the options dropped to 2.5 
million dollars during the next quarter because of a risk in the value of 
the Euro. 
Since there is roughly a 90% correlation between Swiss franc price changes 
and Deutsch Mark price changes, it is quite likely that the market value 
of receivable francs has risen and at least partially oset the loss on the 
options. 
If the put position is marked-to-market for accounting purposes, as would 
be required by an SEC ruling, then the 5 million dollar decline in value 
of the put position would show up on the balance sheet or income state
ment as a reduction of $ 5 million. 
The receivable, however, would not typically be marked to market under 
current accounting standards. 
Before the publication of FAS 133, if the options were written on Swiss 
francs rather than marks, and a number of other conditions were met, 
then accounting standards would allow losses or gains on the put options 
to be deferred until the francs are received and recorded.</text>

          <text>of 500 dierent stocks, 400 industrials, 40 utilities, 20 transportation 
companies, and 40 nancial institutions. The weights in the portfolio 
at any given time are proportional to their market capitalizations. 
 The NASDAQ 100 is based on 100 stocks using the National Asso
ciation of Securities Dealer Automatic Quotations Service. 
All futures contracts on stock indices are settled in cash, not by delivery 
of the underlying asset. All contracts are marked to market on the last 
trading day, and the positions are then deemed to be closed. For most 
contracts, the settlement price on the last trading day is set at the clos
ing value of the index on that day. For the futures on the S&amp;P 500, the 
last trading day is the Thursday before the third Friday of the delivery 
month. 
Futures Prices of Stock indices 
An index can be thought of as an investment asset that pays dividends. 
The asset is the portfolio of stocks underlying the index, and the div
idends are the dividends that would be received by the holder of this 
portfolio. Often there are many stocks underlying the index providing 
dividends at dierent times. To a reasonable approximation, the index 
can then be considered as an asset providing a continuous dividend yield. 
if q is the dividend yield rate, equation ?? gives the futures price, F0,a s :2

in 3 months. We can use heating oil futures traded on NYMEX. Notional

Spot price of jet fuel is $ 277/ton. Futures price of heating oil is $ 
0.6903/gallon. 
The standard deviation of jet fuel price rate of changes over 3 months is

A Program of Foreign Exchange 
Quoting from the 1994 annual report, Merck claims that: 
A signicant portion of the Companys cash ows are denominated in 
foreign currencies. The Company relies on sustained cash ows gener
ated from foreign sources to support its long-term commitment to U.S. 
dollar-based research and development. To the extent the dollar value of 
cash ows is diminished as a result of a strengthening dollar, the Com-
panys ability to fund research and other dollar based strategic initiatives 
at a consistent level may be impaired. To protect against the reduction in 
value of foreign currency cash ows, the Company has instituted balance 
sheet and revenue hedging programs to partially hedge this risk. 
Some Details : The value of purchased currency options, the largest 
category of hedging instruments shown in Mercks disclosure under fair 
value of nancial instruments, was $ 42.5 million as of year-end 1994, 
on a notional amount of $ 1.79 billion underlying these options. 
 The carrying value of these options is shown as $ 97.6 million, in
dicating a loss of $ 55 million, more than half of the value of the 
options. This is consistent with the hedging role of these options 
and the fact that sales were enhanced by approximately 1% (roughly 
$150 million) due to uctuations in exchange rates. 
 On a delta basis, one may therefore draw the conclusion that</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>25</slideno>
          <text>on the portfolio during the three months to be 1.5  8 = 12% below the 
risk-free rate, or -11%. Assume that the dividend yield on the index is 
2% per annum, or 0.5% per three months. This means that the index 
declines by. 7.5% during the three months, from 900 to 832.5. Equation 
?? gives the initial futures price as: 
4 900  e(0.040 .02) 12 = 906.02 (29) 
and the nal futures price as: 
1 
12 832.5  e(0.040 .02) = 833.89. (30) 
The gain on the futures position is: 
(906.02  833.89)  250  14 = 252/prime455 (31) 
The total loss on the portfolio is 0.11  2/prime100/prime000 = $231/prime000. The net 
gain form the hedge position is 252/prime455  231/prime000 or about 1% of the 
value of the portfolio. This is as expected. The return on the hedged 
position during the three months is the risk-free rate. It is easy to verify 
that roughly the same return is realized regardless of the performance 
of the market.</text>

          <text>Active vs. Passive management
Active management means allocation of resources based on an active 
strategy. Usually active management is performed against a benchmark, 
requiring intended over-/ underweights of positions. 
Passive management means following an index, benchmark or another 
portfolio using quantitative techniques, such as principal component 
analysis to replicate an index. 
The discussion of active vs passive management is linked to the e-
cient market discussion: Can information add value (performance).

          <text>Accordingly, the timing-component of an international diversied port-
folio is split into two parts: one in a market-component, which reects 
the investment decisions regarding the specic market and asset cate-
gories, and a second part which reects the currency component from 
the allocation decision in dierent currency exposures: 
N rmarkets = i=1 rs,i  (wp,i  ws,i) 
N rcurrency = i=1 rfx,j  (fp,j  fs,j ) 
The market component is calculated through multiplication of the pas-
sive normal returns rs,j , measured in the specic local currency of the 
investment position, with deviation of the portfolio weights from normal 
weights. The return, coming from the deviation from the strategic cur-
rency allocation, is reected in the fx-component. 
The return component from selectivity is dened as: 
N rselectivity = i=1 ws,i  (rp,i  rs,i) 
The portfolio return, rp,i, and as well the normal return, rs,i, are mea-
sured in the local portfolio currency. The performance component from 
selectivity decisions is thus not be aected from the currency of specic 
investments, but is calculated exclusively through the choice of specic 
securities within a market or an asset category.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>29</slideno>
          <text>Quadrant 3 reects the returns from selectivity and strategy. Selectivity 
is the active choice of individual securities within an asset strategy. The 
normal weights are kept equal. The return from selectivity is received 
through subtraction of the strategy return in quadrant (1) from quadrant 
(3). In quadrant (4) we nally nd the realized return of the portfolio 
over the observation period in examniation, calculated as the product of 
the current weights of the individual asset categories with the current 
returns within the asset categories. Not obvious from the gure is the 
fourth component, the cumulative eect (also called interaction eect), 
which is based on cross product of return- and weight dierences. The 
residual term can be derived from the interaction between timing and 
selectivity. It is based on the fact that the portfolio manager puts more 
weight on the asset categories with a higher return than in the bench -
mark index (selectivity).

          <text>Performance Attribution with a currency
component
We know from previous classes and from own experience that diversi -
cation can improve the performance of the portfolio. Diversication 
can be generated through investments in e.g. dierent asset categories 
or individual sectors, industries etc. Especially the diversication across 
the border lines is important, adding additional low correlations to the 
portfolio. Looking at the performance attribution of international diver-
sied portfolios, we want to know the impacts of strategy, timing and 
selectivity and as well the contribution from fx-components from the 
portfolio allocation. Exposure to foreign currencies can be generated 
through direct investments in fx (buy, sell), or through investments in 
foreign securities, without completely hedging the fx exposures. The 
portfolio return is increases through the fx-return by carrying the fx-
exposures during the observation period. 
We dene with fs,j the strategic component in currency j and fp,j the 
eectively held exposure to currency j. The return of an internationally 
diversied portfolio including fx-exposures can be calculated as following: 
N N rportf olio = i=1 wp,i  rp,i + i=1 fp,i  rfx,j 
wp,i is again the current portfolio weight for asset category i. The cur-
rent return of an actively managed portfolio yields rp,i is no longer ex-
clusively in the domestic currency (1 to 1), but in the local currency 
of the particular investment. Thus, the rst sum of previous equation 
includes the weighted return of the investments in dierent securities,</text>

          <text>The Black-Litterman Model
Mix Beliefs with Portfolio Theory 
The Black-Litterman asset allocation model, developed when both au-
thors were working for Goldman Sachs, is a signicant modication of 
the traditional mean-variance approach. In the mean-variance approach 
of Markowitz, the user inputs a complete set of expected returns and the 
variance-covariance matrix, and the portfolio optimizer generates the op-
timal portfolio weights. Due to the complex mapping between expected 
returns and portfolio weights, users of the standard portfolio optimizers 
often nd that their specication of expected returns produces output 
portfolio weights which may not make sense. These unreasonable results 
stem from two well recognized problems: 
1. Expected returns are very dicult to estimate.	 Investors typically 
have knowledgeable views about absolute or relative returns in only 
a few markets. A standard optimization model, however, requires 
them to provide expected returns for all assets. 
2. The optimal portfolio weights of standard asset allocation models 
are extremely sensitive to the return assumptions used. 
These two problem compound each other; the standard model has no 
way to distinguish strongly held views from auxiliary assumptions, and 
the optimal portfolio it generates, given its sensitivity to the expected 
returns, often appears to bear little or no relation to the views the in-
vestor wishes to express.</text>

per part of the table contains the normal weights and normal returns 
required to calculate the passive strategy of the individual asset cate-
gories. 
In the second part of the table are the eective weights and the current 
returns of the individual asset categories in the specic quarters. 
The current weights and returns are adjusted from quarter to quarter 
to reect the restructuring of the tactical asset allocation and the stock 
picking and result in the active over/-underweights. 
In the lower part of the table are the individual performance compo -
nents resulting in the individual quarters. They are calculated using the 
equations in the previous equations. 
From the results in Table 1 it is obvious that the return from active 
management varies substantially from quarter to quarter and reects no 
constant pattern. The timing-return varies between -0.15% in the 4th 
quarter x1 and max 0.28% in the 1st quarter x1. Selectivity has even 
more variation: min is -0.18% in and 1.48% in the 1st quarter. The 
residual terms have a surprising big impact, with 0.18% of the portfolio 
return in 1st quarter and 2n quarter and reducing the portfolio return 
with -0.39%!.</text>

          <text>Some Denitions
Active management: The pursuit of transactions with the objective of 
proting from competitive information - that is, information that would 
lose its value if it were in the hands of all market participants Active man-
agement is characterized by a process of continued research to generate 
superior judgment, which is then reected in the portfolio by transac -
tions that are held in order to prot from the judgment and that are 
liquidated when the prot has been earned. 
Alpha: The risk adjusted expected return or the return in excess of 
what would be expected from a diversied portfolio with the same sys-
tematic risk When applied to stocks, alpha is essentially synonymous 
with misvaluation: a stock with a positive alpha is viewed as under -
valued relative to other stocks with the same systematic risk, and a 
stock with a negative alpha is viewed as overvalued relative to other 
stocks with the same systematic risk When applied to portfolios, alpha 
is a description of extraordinary reward obtainable through the portfolio 
strategy. Here it is synonymous with good active management: a bet-
ter active manager will have a more positive alpha at a given level of risk. 
Alpha, historical: The dierence between the historical performance and 
what would have been earned with a diversied market portfolio at the 
same level of systematic risk over that period. Under the simplest proce-
dures, historical alpha is estimated as the constant term in a time series 
regression of the asset or portfolio return upon the market return.</text>

Table 1: Example for performance components without currency expo-
sure 
The active management contributed in 5 out of 7 quarters positively 
to the overall return. Over the time period of 7 quarters the active 
management added 2.36%, with contribution from timing of 0.33%, se-
lectivity contributed 1.93% and the residual term 0.10%. Looking at the 
realized return of the portfolio (10.06%), the contribution from active 
management with 2.36% is substantial! 
Even more important is the contribution from the strategy, which added 
7.70% to the portfolio return, and thus is the most important component. 
This example shows quite nicely, that the most important contribution 
to the return is from the strategic asset allocation. The substantial part 
of the achieved investment performance is based on the strategy and not 
from the active management through the portfolio manager.</text>

          <text>Tracking Error
The tracking error is dened as: the standard deviation of active re-
turn. 
A = std [rAP ]=  [rP ]   [rBM ] 
= AP = P  BM (11) 
The tracking error measures the deviation from the benchmark, as the 
rp is the sum of the weighted returns of all positions in the portfolio and 
rBM is the sum of the weighted returns of all positions in the benchmarks. 
Portfolio and benchmark do not always contain the same positions! 
Tracking error is called as well active risk.</text>

Divides average portfolio excess return over the sample period by the 
standard deviation of returns over that period. It measures the reward 
to (total) volatility trade-o? 
Treynors measure: 
Treynor  s = rp  rf (14)p 
Gives excess return per unit of risk over the sample period by the stan-
dard deviation of returns over that period. It uses systemic risk instead 
of total risk. 
Jensens measure: 
Jensen s  = rp  [rf + p (rM  rf )] (15) 
It is the average return on the portfolio over and above that perdicted by 
the CAPM, given the portfolioos beta and the average market return. 
Jensens measure is the portfolios alpha value.

          <text>The Treynor-Black Model
Mix Security Analysis with Portfolio Theory 
Suppose that you nd several securities appear to be mispriced relative 
to the pricing model of your choice, say the CAPM. 
According to the CAPM, the expected return of any security with k 
is: 
CAPM  = rf + k  (E (rM )  rf) (5) k 
Let A be subset with mis-priced securities. For any security k  A, 
you nd that 
CAPM rk = k + k + k (6) 
where k is the perceived abnormal return. 
You would like to exploit the mis-pricing in the subset A. For this, 
your form a portfolio A, consisting of the mis-priced securities. At the 
same time, you believe that the rest of the universe is fairly priced. 
The rest of the portfolio allocation problem then becomes a standard 
one: 
 The objective is that of a mean-variance investor. 
 The choice of assets: 
1. The market portfolio with M and M 
2. The portfolio of mis-priced securities A, 
3. with A and A</text>

          <text>Summary
The (simple) performance attribution allows to gure out where the 
portfolio manager manager added value and where he destroyed value. 
It is key to learn from past errors and not to repeat them. Perfor -
mance attribution is an essential element in investment to ensure that 
exposures are rewarded with the appropriate risk premium. 
The capital market oriented performance attribution is another approach 
to analyze the performance. It allows to calculate the riskpremiums for 
the factors / styles to which the portfolio is exposed.

          <text>In practice, therefore, despite the obvious attractions of a quantitative 
approach, few global investment managers regularly allow quantitative 
models to play a major role in their asset allocation decision. In the 
Black-Litterman model, the user inputs any number of views or state-
ments about the expected returns of arbitrary portfolios, and the model 
combines the views with equilibrium, producing both the set of expected 
returns of assets as well as the optimal portfolio weights. Since publi-
cation of 1990, the Black-Litterman asset allocation model has gained 
wide application in many nancial institutions.</text>

          <text>Alpha, judgmental: The nal output of a research process, embody -
ing in a single quantitative measure the degree of under or overvaluation 
of the stocks Judgmental alpha is a product of investment research and 
unique to the individual or organization that produces it is derived from 
a forecast of extraordinary return, but it has been adjusted to be the 
expected value of subsequent extraordinary return. For example, among 
those stocks that are assigned judgmental alphas of 2 percent, the aver-
age performance (when compared to other stocks of the same systematic 
risk with alphas of zero) should be 2 percent per annum. Thus, average 
experienced performance for any category of judgmental alpha should 
equal the alpha itself. A judgmental alpha is a prediction, not retro-
spective experience. 
Alpha, required: The risk adjusted expected return required to cause 
the portfolio holding to be optimal, in view of the risk/reward tradeo. 
The required alpha is found by solving for the contribution of the hold-
ing to portfolio risk and by applying a risk/reward tradeo to nd the 
corresponding alpha. It can be viewed as a translation of portfolio risk 
exposure into the judgment which warrants that exposure.</text>

          <text>Performance Attribution
The identication of individual return components can be performed 
quite easily, subject to the history of the restructuring of the portfolio. 
The straight forward approach is based on the denition of a passive 
benchmark portfolio, which reects the long-term investment strategy. 
In the context of the investment strategy (or the strategic asset alloca -
tion) the investment management decides which asset categories (equi-
ties, xed income, currencies, etc.) are over-/underweighted relative to 
the benchmark (strategy). The weights of specic asset categories - as 
determined in the investment strategy - are called normal weights. 
For each asset category of the portfolio exists a corresponding asset cat-
egory of the benchmark (index), relative to which the performance is 
calculated. The return of these indices are called normal returns. It is 
obvious, that the the normal return is a return of a passive investment 
in the corresponding asset category of the benchmark. 
For equities, xed income and for currencies exist dierent indices, re-
ecting dierent needs. 
The normal weight of the asset category i (ws,i) multiplied with the nor-
mal return (rs,i) is the return of this intended asset category. Summed 
up over all returns from the dierent asset categories, the portfolio has 
the following strategy /-benchmark return: 
N rstrategy = i=1 ws,i  rs,i</text>

          <text>Factor Denitions:
Size: Captures dierences in stock returns due to dierences in the mar-
ket capitalization of companies This index continues to be a signicant 
determinant of performance as well as risk. 
Success: Identies recently successful stocks using price behavior in the 
market as measured by relative strength. The relative strength of a stock 
is signicant in explaining its volatility. 
Value: Captures the extent to which a stock is priced inexpensively 
in the market. The descriptors are as follows: 
 Forecast Earnings to Price; 
 Actual Earnings to Price; 
 Actual Earnings to Price; 
 Yield. 
Variability in Markets (VIM): Predicts a stocks volatility, net of the 
market, based on its historical behavior. Unlike beta, this index mea-
sures the stocks overall volatility. 
Growth: Uses historical growth and protability measures to predict 
future earnings growth. The descriptors are as follows: 
 Dividend payout ratio over ve years Computed using the last ve 
years of data on dividends and earnings; 
 Variability in capital structure;</text>

          <text>measured in the local currency of the corresponding market. For invest -
ments in American securities it reects e.g. the local equity return in 
US$. With the second term in the previous equation we add an addi-
tional return components coming from the fx-return for the exposure 
held in the particular currency. The currency return rfx,j is weighted 
with the corresponding fx-component in the portfolio. In the example, 
where e.g. 20% of the equity portfolio are invested in Euro-denominated 
securities (without hedging the portfolio against the Euro-exposure), we 
have to add to the local US-equity return a 20%-investment (exposure) 
in Euro-currency. For a portfolio, which is exclusively invested in the 
domestic portfolio currency, the second terms is dropped. 
The strategy return is calculated analogous to the portfolio return us-
ing the passive strategy weights and normal returns in the local currency: 
N N rstrategy = i=1 ws,i  rs,i + i=1 fs,i  rfx,j 
Again, here as well we add a fx-component. The dierent fx-returns 
are weighted according their corresponding strategic fx-weights fs,j . 
The decision, to vary the proportions of individual currency exposures in 
the portfolio is considered part of the tactical asset allocation. Through 
conscious deviations from strategic currency weights the active portfolio 
manager can add (loose) an additional return component to the domes -
tic portfolio return. 
Independent from the previous statement is the decision to invest in 
local markets and asset categories to benet from the local performance.</text>

          <text>From Where does Superior Performance
Come?
From Where does Superior Performance Come? Superior performance 
arises from active investment decisions which dierentiate the portfolio 
from a passive benchmark These decisions include: 
 Market Timing : Altering market risk exposure through time to 
make advantage of market uctuations; 
 Sectoral emphasis : Weighting the portfolio towards (or away from) 
company attributes, such as size, leverage, book/price, and yield, 
and towards (or away from) industries; 
 Stock selection : Marking bets in the portfolio based on informa -
tion idiosyncractic to individual securities; 
 Trading : large funds can earn incremental reward by accommodat -
ing hurried buyers and sellers.</text>

          <slideno>27</slideno>
          <text>Against this benchmark-portfolio we want to know the realized return 
of the actively managed portfolio. We have a positive excess-return, if 
the eectively realized portfolio return (rportf olio) exceeds the strategy 
return (rstratey): 
rexcess return = rstrategy  rportf olio 
The current portfolio return (rportf olio) is calculated from the eective 
breakdown of the portfolio in the dierent asset categories (wp,i) as well 
as the eectively realized returns (rs,i) of the individual asset categories: 
N rportf olio = i=1 wp,i  rp,i 
The dierence between the strategy return and the realized portfolio 
return results from the fact, that the portfolio manager restructures the 
portfolio through market timing strategies based on the on the assump -
tion of predicting the direction of the performance. Overperformance 
by timing the market can be achieved by adjusting the overall market 
exposure of the portfolio. Various techniques exist to time the market: 
 tactical over- and underweights of categories and thus deviates from 
the normal weights thourghchanges in the asset class mix (especially 
stock and cash positions), also called rotation (sector rotation, asset 
class rotation) 
 timing within an asset class: changing the security mix by shifting 
the proportions of conservative (low beta) and dynamic (high beta) 
securities.</text>

          <text>derivatives instruments: especially index futures and the use of op-
tions. 
Security selection is the identication of over/-under priced securities. 
So a superior valuation process is needed to compare the true value for 
a security with the current market value. 
Overall, the return of a portfolio can be decomposed in four return com-
ponents, which summed up again result in (rportf olio): 
N  rstrategy = i=1 ws,i  rs,i 
N  rtiming = i=1 rs,i  (wp,i  ws,i) 
N  rselectivity = i=1 ws,i  (rp,i  rs,i) 
N  rcumulative ef f ect = i=1 (wp,i  ws,i)  (rp,i  rs,i) 
Figure 1 highlights the decomposition of the portfolio return in the in-
dividual components and their relationship to a active respectively pas-
sive portfolio management. Quadrant (1) is put together from passive 
selectivity and passive timing. It represents the long-term investment 
strategy and serves as the benchmark return for the observation period 
in examination. If the portfolio management performs a passive market 
timing, we receive the return in quadrant (2). It represents the return 
from timing and strategy. We understand timing as the deviation in the 
weight of the individual asset category from the normal weight. Within 
the individual asset categories we invest in a passive index portfolio. 
Through subtraction of the strategy return from quadrant (1) we re-
ceive the net result from timing.</text>

Table 2 the study has be carried out over a time period of 10 years. 
In the rst analysis the pension funds realized a return of 9.01%. This 
is 1.10% below the strategy return of 10.11. The active management 
destroyed value worth 1.10% (0.66% timing, 0.36%). For the second 
analysis the results look not better. The selectivity added in average 
0.26% to the annual return, however the active return does not look bet-
ter, active management lowered the returns by 8 basis points in average. 
A comparison between the dimension of strategy return and the added 
value of active management shows in both studies that the active com-
ponent is only a small fraction of the total return.</text>

          <text>Some Structural Details
The majority of the funds are organized as limited partnerships, allowing 
only 99 investors. General partners usually have a signicant investment 
in the partnership. 
Performance based compensation. Typically, 20% of net prots in ad
dition to 1% management fee. Most performance fees are subject to a 
high watermark, and some require a hurdle rate. 
Restricted withdrawals. Typically, limited partners are allowed to with
draw only annually, and some had a lock up period as long as three 
years. 
A culture of secrecy. Rarely are limited partners given a list of portfolio 
holdings.</text>

The Fund was now down to $2.95 billion, with a dangerously high lever
age ratio of 42.
To reduce their risk, the partners would have to sell something. But
what? Investors wanted only the safest bonds, which LTCM didnt have.
August was the worst month ever recorded in credit spreads. Unlike the
the ballooning spreads traditionally linked with an economic collapse,
this one was caused by a panic on Wall Street.
In August, three quarters of all hedge funds lost money, and LTCM lost
the most: $1.9 billion, which was 45% of its capital.</text>

          <text>The Fall of LTCM
Following a successful 1997, LTCM began the year with about $4.8 bil
lion in capital, having just returned $2.7 billion to out-side investors. 
In May and June the Fund experienced its two worst months ever, with 
gross returns of 6.7% and 10.1% respectively. The losses were distributed 
across many positions, with no single trade experiencing a large loss. In 
response to the losses, LTCM reduced the risk of the portfolio. By July 
21, the fund was up 7.5% on the month. But the month of August was 
a continuation of adverse movements, and by mid August, overall posi
tions had been cut by an additional 5%. 
On Monday, August 17, 1998, in an event that stunned the world, Rus
sia defaulted on its government debt. LTCM had only a small exposure 
to Russian government credit, and the Fund suered a correspondingly 
small loss in these positions. 
Friday, August 21, was the worst day in the Funds history, as many of 
the Funds trades moved adversely and substantially: 
1. During the morning, the U.S. swap spread widened by 19 bps, com
pared with a typical daily move of less than a basis point. The U.K. 
gilt swap spread also widened dramatically that day. The Fund had 
large short positions in both of these swap spreads. 
2. LTCM suered a signicant loss in a risk arbitrage position related 
to the planned acquisition of telephone equipment maker Ciena Corp 
by Tellabs, Inc. 
LTCM estimated that the combination of the risk arb loss and the un
precedented widening of the U.S. and U.K. swap spreads and other 
spreads had resulted in a one day loss of about $553 million - 15% of its</text>

          <text>The Beginning of Hedge Funds
In 1949, Alfred Jones established the rst hedge fund in the U.S. 
At its beginning, the dening characteristic of a hedge fund was that 
it hedged against the likelihood of a declining market. 
Two speculative tools were merged into a conservative form of investing: 
1. leverage was used to obtain higher prots. 2. short selling was em
ployed to hedge against the downside risk. 
By combining long and short positions, Jones exploited the relative pric
ing of stocks, while minimizing his exposure to the overall market. 
To align the manager/investor incentives, Jones employed performance 
based fee compensation. He also kept all of his own money in the fund.</text>

          <text>Low Correlation Among Hedge Fund
Hedge fund mangers exhibit much lower correlation with one another 
than traditional active managers: 
 Between 1990 and 2000, the average correlation among Lipper (mu
tual funds) managers has been on the order of 90%, 
 while hedge fund managers resemble S&amp;P 500 stocks have an average 
correlation on the order of 10%. 
 for the universe of stocks, the average correlation is about 20%. The 
low average correlation among hedge fund managers suggests that 
pooling funds into portfolios or indices can signicantly reduce their 
total risk, providing distinct advantages relative to traditional active 
strategies.</text>

          <text>The Rise of LTCM
The fund that LTCM managed had commenced operations with $1 bil
lion of capital in early 1994, and had subsequently raised an additional 
$2 billion. 
In September 1997, after three and half years of investment returns that 
far exceeded even the principals expectations, the Funds net capital 
stood at $6.7 billion. 
Since inception, the Funds returns after fees had been 19.9% from Febru
ary 24 through December 31, 19941 42.8% in 1995, 40.8% in 1996, and 
11.1% in 1997 through August. 
These returns were achieved without exposure to the stock market. In 
many of its trades, the rm was in eect a seller of liquidity, diversied 
across many markets.</text>

          <text>A Little History of Hedge Funds
While mutual funds were the darlings of Wall Street in the 60s, Jones 
hedge fund was outperforming the best mutual funds even after the 20% 
incentive fee deduction. The news of Jones performance created excite
ment, and by 1968, approximately 200 hedge funds were in existence. 
During the 60s bull market, many of the new hedge fund man-agers 
stopped hedging the downside risk, and went into the bear market of 
the early 70s with long, leveraged positions. Many were put out of busi
ness. 
During the next decade, only a modest number of hedge funds were 
established. 
Over the past 10 years, however, the number of funds has increased 
at an average rate of 25 74% per year.</text>

          <text>Investment Flexibility
Hedge funds are largely unregulated. This lack of regulation permitted 
a hedge fund manager to employ leverage, to sell short, and to charge 
performance based fees, practices that normally were not available to 
regulated investors such as mutual funds. 
A second dierentiating characteristic was the amount of leverage em
ployed. Hedge fund managers were able to leverage their portfolios 
through the use of futures, options, and repurchase agreements, as well 
as through more traditional sources of nancing such as banks and bro
kerage rms. 
While hedge funds came in all shapes and sizes, they tended to have 
one common trait: low correlation with the U.S. equity market.</text>

          <text>A Taxonomy of Hedge Fund Strategies
Directional Trading: based on speculation of market direction in mul
tiple asset classes. Both model based systems and subjective judgment 
are used to make trading decisions. 
Relative Value: focus on spread relationships between pricing compo
nents of nancial assets. Market risk is kept to a mini-mum. Many 
managers use leverage to enhance returns. 
Specialist Credit: based on credit sensitive securities. Funds in this 
strategy conduct a high level of due diligence in order to identify rela
tively inexpensive securities. 
Stock Selection: combine long and short positions, primary in equities, 
in order to exploit under and overvalued securities. Market exposure can 
vary substantially.</text>

          <text>Summary
What to learn in this course? Analytical modeling skills, quantitative 
tools, and empirical knowledge about the nancial market and the -
nancial instruments. 
How to think about the nancial system? 
 Functional perspectives: across time and space; 
 Institutional compositions: results from the functional needs. 
 Does nancial innovation add value? 
 Sometimes abusive usage of nancial innovation causes disruptions. 
Overall, however, nancial innovation provides diversied in-vestment 
opportunities for investors, risk management tools and techniques for 
market participants and liquidity to the overall market.

          <text>The Financial System
The nancial system can be viewed from two dierent angles: 
 Institutional perspective: the nancial system encompasses the mar-
kets, intermediaries, instruments, clients etc.; and 
 Functional perspective: the nancial system facilitates the allocation 
and deployment of economic resources, across time and space and in 
uncertain environment. 
While its institutional composition changes over time and space (dif-
ferent places on the globe), the basic functions of a nancial system are 
essentially the same in all economies. The institutional dimension results 
from the functional needs.</text>

          <text>Currencies
Currencies are the most liquid nancial instrument. 
Currency instruments have generally spoken the same type of parame -
ters, however with dierent characteristics, e.g. currency return volatil -
ity, which is not shaped in the same form as the equity return volatility. 
Currency positions usually have a much shorter maturity proprietary 
traders on Wall Street take positions up to half an hour!</text>

          <text>Financial Innovation
Does nancial innovation add value? If taken to excess, any virtue can 
readily become a vice: The market has seen examples of failed nancial 
products, erroneous assumption and strategies, abusive usage of deriva -
tives, distressed hedge funds etc. Empirical evidence supports the state-
ment, that nancial innovation does provide social wealth: 
 It caters to the investment diversity desired by the investors; 
 It improves the opportunities for investors to receive ecient risk-
return trade-os; 
 It provides risk management tools for all market participants; and 
 It promotes broad distribution and liquidity to economic resources.</text>

          <text>Institutional Perspective
The institutional compositions of the nancial system includes: 
 Financial markets: equity, xed income (debt), credits and deriva -
tives 
 Financial intermediaries: banks, insurance companies, pension funds, 
mutual funds, investment banks, venture capital rms, asset man-
agement rms and information providers etc. 
 Financial infrastructure and regulation: trading rules, contract en-
forcement, account system, capital requirements etc. 
 Governmental and quasi-governmental organizations: SEC, central 
banks (Federal Reserve System), the Bank for International Set-
tlement (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World 
Bank, etc. 
International markets dier in many ways: 
 The US market is currently the only market oering Financial Fu-
tures on individual stocks ; 
 Germany closed the Neue Markt, eliminating a platform for not 
very liquid stocks, regarding stock exchanges inexperienced compa -
nies, thus rising capital is getting more dicult for young companies;</text>

          <text>Functional Perspective
The nancial system provides six functions: 
 Transferring economic resources across time (e.g. student loans, re-
tirement funds) and space (global nancial market, e.g. institutional 
investments) 
 Clearing and settling payments to facilitate trades: money, check, 
ATM cards, mortgages and mortgage interest payments, etc. 
 Pooling of resources to undertake large-scale indivisible enterprise 
(equities, money market funds, mutual funds etc.) 
 Information to coordinate decision-making, facilitating information 
ow, price discovery, the normal indices for equities, xed income 
rates, volatilities etc. 
 Dealing with agency problems, mitigate moral hazard, adverse selec-
tion and principal-agent based problems that are caused by asym-
metry information or incentive mis-matches (collateralization, CEO 
incentive for company performance etc.). 
 Managing risks, bundling, packaging, pooling and tranching of risk 
(insurance companies, CMO, CDO, exotic derivatives etc.)</text>

          <text>Course Objectives
Through this class I want to help you build the following skills: 
 Analytical ability: modeling skills that are important in making 
investment decisions, 
 Quantitative skills: developing problem solving skills, data analysis, 
probability evaluation of uncertain events. 
 Empirical knowledge of the nancial markets: equity, xed income 
(default-free and defaultable) and their respective derivatives.</text>

Nasdaq, SP500, DAX, FTSE etc. 
 Economic condition: macro-economic variables, e.g. GDP-growth, 
ination, employment rate, business cycles, liquidity, interest 
rates etc. 
 Some important empirical evidence: 
 Patterns in the cross-section of stock return: value (value vs. 
growth), size (small vs. large), momentum (low vs. high); 
 Time-series behavior of stock returns: time-varying expected re-
turns, predictability, stochastic volatility etc.</text>

Fixed income, also known as debt-instruments, promise to pay xed, 
pre-determined stream of cash ows in the future: Coupon payments, 
Principal amount (denominations), Time to maturity, Sinking fund obli-
gations, etc. 
Figure 4: Cash Flows, Source: RiskM etricsTM , Technical Document, p. 109 
Figure 5: Discounted Cash Flows, Source: RiskM etricsTM , Technical Document, p. 109 
Treasury bills, notes and bonds vary in maturity. T-bonds may also be 
callable during a given period. 
The value of a bond can be reported in terms of price or yield to matu-
rity. Yield go and price go.</text>

          <text>Stocks
Common stocks, also known as Equities, represent ownership shares of 
a corporation. 
 Two important characteristics: residual claim and limited liability; 
 Sources of returns: dividends and capital gains; 
 Calculating returns: buy at time 0 and pay P0, sell at time T and
receive PT and dividend DT :
 The percentage return is calculated as: 
PT + DT  P0 rT = (1)PO 
 The log-return is calculated as: 
PT + DT rT = ln (2)PO 
For small rT , the log-return and percentage return are close. 
Question: Why in some situations should we prefer to use log-
returns? 
 Some determinants of stock returns: 
 Firm-specic condition: management, productivity, earnings, growth-
potential, market-liquidity,</text>

          <text>Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are similar in structure to Treasury issues, with one 
important dierence: default risk. 
 Because of the default risk, corporate bonds are cheaper (than their 
respective Treasury counterparts), paying higher yields. 
 The dierence in yields is referred to as credit spread. 
 The probability of default varies across rms of dierent credit qual-
ities (e.g. countries, industries, guarantees etc.) 
 The probability of default varies over time!

          <text>Example: A portfolio consists of two long assets $100 each. The prob
ability of default over the next year is 10% for the rst asset, 20% for 
the second asset, and the joint probabilit y of default is 3%. What is 
the expected loss on this portfolio due to credit risk over the next year 
assuming 40% recovery rate for both assets. 
Probabilities: 
0.1  (1  0.2)  default probability of A (9) 
0.2  (1  0.1)  default probability of B (10) 
0.03  joint default probability (11) 
Expected losses: 
0.1  (1  0.2)  100  (1  0.4) = 4.8 (12) 
0.2  (1  0.1)  100  (1  0.4) = 10.8 (13) 
0.03  200  (1  0.4) = 3.6 (14) 
4.8 + 10.8+3.6 = $19.2 mio. (15) 
Example: Assume a 1-year US Treasury yield is 5.5% and a Eurodollar 
deposit rate is 6%. What is the probabilit y of the Eurodollar deposit to 
default assuming zero recovery rate)?

          <text>Default Intensity
In general, the credit qualit y of a rm changes over time. 
A more realistic model is to treat the arrival intensity as a random 
process. 
Suppose that intensities are updated with new information at the begin
ning of each year, and are constan t during the year. Then the probabilit y 
of surviv al for t years is 
E
0+1++t1e (7)
For example, 
 t+1  t = k  t + t+1 (8) 
Can you calculate the probabilit y of surviv al for  years? What is the 
price of a  -year zero-coup on bond? What if the riskfree interest rate is 
also stochastic?</text>

          <text>Modelling Default Risk
Modelling default risk is central to the pricing and hedging of credit sen
sitive instrumen ts. 
Two approac hes to modelling default risk: 
 Structural approac h, rst-passage: default happens when the to
tal asset value of the rm falls below a threshold value (for example, 
the rms book liabilit y) for the rst time. 
 Reduced-form, intensity-based: the random default time  is gov
erned by an intensity process . 
For pricing purpose, the reduced-form approac h is adequate, and will be 
the focus of this class.</text>

For simplicit y, lets rst assume that the riskfree interest rate r is a

default intensity : 
rP0 = $100  e  Prob(   ) (4) 
r P0 = $100  e  e (5) 
P0 = $100  e (r+) (6) 
where we assume that conditioning on a default, the recovery value of

The yield on the defaultable bond is r + , resulting in a credit spread

          <text>Why Normals?
Model the random uctuation of stock prices using geometric Brownian motion. Im-
plication for stock returns: normal distribution (for continuously compounded returns).
The annualized stock return is normal with mean ( ) and standard deviation ( ).
For the S&amp;P 500 index returns, is roughly 12%, and is roughly 15%. The latter is
also called volatility.
Fix a time horizon, say  t. The stock return over  is normally distributed with
mean tand standard deviation 
t. What is the distribution of daily returns?

Second, convert the critical value for r to that for X:

Finally, knowing that X is a standard normal,
Prob(X&lt;23) = N(23) = 10127! (32)

          <text>It is tempting to suggest that a stock price follows a generalized Wiener process; that
is, that it has a constant expected rift rate and a constant variance rate, However,
this model fails to capture a key aspect of stock prices. This is that the expected per-
centage return required by investors from a stock is independent of the stock price. Ifinvestors require a 14% per annum expected return when the stock price is $ 10, thenceteris paribus, they will also require a 14% per annum expected return when it is $50. Clearly, the constant expected rift-rate assumption is inappropriate and needs tobe replaced by the assumption that the expected return (that is, expected rift dividedby the stock price) is constant. If Sis the stock price at time t, the expected drift rate
inSshould be assumed to be Sfor some constant parameter, . This means that in
a short interval of time,  t, the expected increase in SisSt. The parameter, ,i s
the expected rate of return on the stock, expressed in decimal form.If the volatility of the stock price is always zero, this model implies that
S=St (21)
in the limit as  t0
dS=Sdt (22)
or
dS
S=dt (23)
so that
ST=S0eT(24)
where S0andSTare the stock price at time zero and time T. Equation 24 shows that
when the variance rate is zero, the stock price grows at a continuously compoundedrate of per unit of time.
In practice, of course, a stock price does exhibit volatility. A reasonable assumption
is that the variability of the percentage return in a short period of time,  t,i st h e
same regardless of the stock price. In other word, an investor is just as uncertain of thepercentage return when the stock price is $ 50 as when it is $ 10. This suggests that thestandard deviation of the change in a short period of time  tshould be proportional
to the stock price and leads to the model
dS=Sdt+Sdz (25)
or
dSS=dt+dz. (26)

          <text>Conditional Version
So far, we assumed that the distribution of stock returns stays the same throughout
history. We calculate the sample statistics as if history repeats itself with the same
probability law.
But we know that this cannot be true. How do we use the data when we have reasons
to believe that the probability law changes over time?
For example, suppose we believe that the daily returns within each month tare nor-
mally distributed with mean tand standard deviation t, which vary over time t.
The simplest way to take the conditional information into account is to calculate the
sample mean and standard deviation month by month.

          <text>From the second property of Wiener processes, the is are independent of each other,
if follows from equation 6 that z(T)z(0) is normally distributed with
mean of [z(T)z(0)] = 0 (7)
standard deviation of [z(T)z(0)] =
t (8)
variance of [z(T)z(0)] =  t (9)
This is consistent with the discussion earlier in this section.
Generalized Wiener ProcessThe basic Wiener process, dz, that has been developed so far has a drift rate of zero
and a variance rate of 1.0. The drift rate of zero means that the expected value of z
at any future time is equal to its current value. the variance rate of 1.0 means thatthe variance of the change in zin a time interval of length Tequals T. A generalized
Wiener process for a variable xcan be dened in terms of dzas follows
dx=ad t+bd z (10)
where a and b are constants.
To understand equation 10, it is useful to consider the two components on the right-
hand side separately. The ad tterm implies that xhas an expected drift rate of a per
unit of time. With the bd zterm, the equation is
dx=ad t (11)
which implies that
dx
dt=a (12)
or
x=x0+at (13)
where x0is the value of xat time zero. In a period of time of length T,xincreases by
an amount aT.T h e bd zterm on the right-handed side of euqation 10 can be regarded
as adding noses or variability to the parth followed by x. The amount of this noise or
variability is btimes a Wiener process. A Wiener process has a standard deviation of
1.0. It follows that btimes a Wiener proces has a standard deviation of b.I nas m a l l

          <text>Equation 26 is the most widely used model of stock price behavior. The variable is
the volatility of the stock price. the variable is its expected rate of return.
The discrete-time version of the model is

S=St+S

The variable  Sis the change on the stock price, S, in a small interval of time,  t,
andis a random drawing from a standardized normal distribution (i.e.g, normal
distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1.0). The parameter, ,i s
the expected rate of return per unit of time from the stock and the parameter, ,i s
the volatility of the stock price. Both of these parameters are assumed constant.The left-hand side of equation 27 is the return provided by the stock in a short periodof time,  t. The term tis the expected value of this return, and the term 
t
is the stochastic component of the return. The variance of the stochastic component
(and therefore, of the whole return) is 2t. This is consistent with the denition of

          <text>What Normal Fails to Capture...
There are large movements (both up and down) in stock prices that cannot be captured
at all by the normal distribution.
In mathematical terms, the tail distribution of a normal random variable is too thin.
Historical stock returns exhibit fat tails.
If we make nancial decisions based on normal distribution, we will miss out on the
large movements. The consequences are catastrophic!
This is especially important for leveraged investments over a short time horizon.Tail fatness is also an important issue in risk management.

          <text>A Digression to History
In his 1900 dissertation on The Theory of Speculation, Louis Bachelier searched for
a formula which expresses the likelihood of a market uctuation.  He ended up with
a mathematical formula that describes the Brownian Motion.
In the nance world, Brownian Motion came to be called the random walk, once
described as the path a drunk might follow at night in the light of a lamp post.
Using the geometric Brownian motion to describe the random uctuations in stock
prices, Fisher Black, Myron Scholes, and Bob Merton worked out the Black Scholes
option pricing formula.
This work was done in the spring of 1970, when both Merton and Scholes were at
MIT Sloan!

          <text>Time Series Patterns
While the unconditional version of sample statistics gives us a static picture of daily
stock returns, the conditional version provides more dynamic information. For example,
The conditional expected returns are time varying, but there is not much persis-
tence.
The conditional volatilities are also time varying. Moreover, they seem to be
highly persistent.
There is a negative relationship between returns and volatility: when the market
goes down, the volatility goes up.
We will revisit these issues in more detail in Class 9.

The change  zduring a small period of time  tis:

where is a random drawing from a standardized normal distribution N(0,1). The
values of  zfor any two dierent short intervals of time  tare independent.
It follows from the rst property that  zitself has a normal distribution with:
mean of z=0 ( 2 )
standard deviation of z=
t (3)
variance of z=t (4)
The second property implies that z follows a Markov process.1
Consider the increase in the value of z during a relatively long period of time T. This
can be denoted by z(T)z(0). It can be regarded as the sum of the increases in zin
Nsmall time intervals of length  t, where
N=T

Thus

1A Markov process is a particular type of stochastic process where only the present value for a
variable is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and the way that the
present has emerged from the past are irrelevant. Stock prices are usually assumed to follow a Markov
process. Suppose that the price of IBM stock is $ 100 now. If the stock price follows a Markov process,our predictions should be unaected by the price one week ago, one month ago, or one year ago. The
only relevant piece of information is that the price is now $ 100.
Predictions for the future are uncertain and must be expressed in terms of probability distributions.The Markov property implies that the probability distribution of the price at any particular future
time is not dependent on the particular path followed by the price in the past.
The Markov property of stock prices is consistent with the weak form of market eciency .T h i ss a t e s
that the present price of a stock impounds all the information contained in a record of past prices. If
the weak form of market eciency were not true, technical analysts could make above-average returns
by interpreting charts of the past history of stock prices. There is very little evidence that they are,in fact, able to do this.
Statistical properties of the stock price history of IBM may be useful in determining the characteristics
of the stochastic process followed by the stock price (e.g. its volatility). The point being made hereis that the particular path followed by the stock in the past is irrelevant.

          <text>Summary
We use probability distributions to characterize and evaluate random events.
There is a long tradition of using normal distributions to characterize the uctua-
tions in stock prices.
The normal distributions, however, are not adequate to capture large surprises.The empirical distribution and sample moments are useful statistical tools to extract
information from the data. Stationarity is one important assumption.
The precision of the sample moments can be measured by their standard errors.
The sample statistics can be used in both unconditional and conditional versions. The
conditional version provides more dynamic information about the data.

          <text>Questions for Next Class
Please read:
BKM Chapters 6 and 7,
Elton and Gruber (2000), and
Kritzman (1992)
Think about the following questions:
Two important components in making an investment decision: the investment
opportunity and the investor.
Admittedly, one investor may dier from another. And the investment opportu-
nity does not stay constant across space or time.
If you were asked to build a model of investments for a generic investor on a
generic market environment, what are the basic features you would include inyour model?

          <text>A Summary of the CAPM Tests
In general, the test results depend on the sample data, sample peri
ods, statistical approac hes, proxy for the market portfolio, etc. But the 
following ndings remain robust: 
 The relation between risk and reward is much atter than that pre
dicted by the CAPM 1 = i  rf . 
 The risk measure  cannot even begin to explain the cross sectional 
variation in the expected returns. (1 is statistically insignican t, R 
squared is close to zero.) 
 Contrary to the prediction of the CAPM, the intercept 0 is signi
cantly dieren t from zero.</text>

          <text>Regression in Action 
Set up a regression: 
 The dependen t variable: yi = i  rf 
 The independen t variable: xi =  i 
 Add noise i that is unrelated to i. 
Feed the data to the regression package: 
estimate standard error t-stat 
0 6% 1.8% 3.5 
1 0.17% 1.7% 0,1 
R squared = 2% 
Recall the implications of the CAPM: 
1. The intercept 0 =0 
2. The slope 1 = M  rf = rf</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>An Ideal Test of the CAPM
In an ideal situation, we have the following inputs: 
1. Riskfree borrowing/ lending rate rf 
2. Expected returns on the market E(rM ) and on the risky asset E(ri). 
3. The exposure to market risk 
cov (rM ,ri)i = (1) var (rM ) 
These inputs allow us to examine the relation between reward (E(rf )  
rf ) and risk i 
1. More risk, more reward? 
2. Do they line up? 
3. What is the reward for a risk exposure of 1? 
4. Zero risk, zero reward?</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>21</slideno>
          <text>Some Possible Explanations
1. Is the stock market index a good proxy for the market portfolio? 
 only 1/3 non governmen tal tangible assets are owned by the corpo
rate sector. 
 among the corporate assets, only 1/3 is nanced by equity 
 what about intangible assets, like human capital? 
 what about international markets? 
2. Measuremen t error in : 
 Except for the market portfolio, we never observ e the true . 
 To test the CAPM, we use estimates for , which are measured with 
errors. 
 The measuremen t error in  will cause a downward biased estimate 
for the slope coecien t, and an upward biased estimate for the in
tercept. 
3. Measuremen t error in expected returns 
 we use sample means M and i as proxies for the real, unob-serv able 
expected returns 
 it is known that means are hard to estimate, and there are noises in 
our estimates M and i and 
 if the noises in M and i are correlated, then we have a statistical 
problem (errors in variables)

          <text>The Standard Error
In Order to guess the real values of b and a, we use the data to help us. 
Given N pairs of observ ations (yi,xi), our regression solutions b and 
a are the best guesses. But we can never be 100% sure. 
How to quantify our uncertain ty about b and a. 
We think of  b, we can b and a as random variables. For any estimate, say  
get an estimate of its standard deviation, which is usually referred to as 
the Standard Error. The standard error of an estimate is one measure 
of its precision.</text>

          <text>Regression: The Basic Setup
Two variables x and y, N pairs of outcomes: 
(xi,yj ),i =1, 2,...,N. (10) 
We have reasons to believe that y and x are related. In particular, we 
would like to use x to explain y: 
yi = a + bxj + . (11) 
y: the dependen t variable. 
x: the independen t (explanatory) variable. 
i: a random disturbance with zero mean. 
coecien ts: intercept a, slope b.</text>

          <text>Testing the Linear Relation
pick a proxy for the market portfolio rM , and record N monthly returns: 
rt,M : i =1,...,N (7) 
for the same sample period, collect a sample of I rms, each with N 
monthly returns: 
rt,1 : i =1,...,I and t =1,...,N (8) 
construct the sample mean for rM . 
for the i-th rm, construct the sample mean i , and the sample es
timate i. 
for i = 1,. . . ,I test the linear relation: 
i  rf = 0 + 1i (9)</text>

          <text>Interpreting the Regression Result
For the purpose of this class, you will use a canned regression package 
(e.g., Excel): 
Input: (yi,xi), i =1,...,N Output: 
 the estimates b and a and 
 their standard errors: sb and sa 
b b/s  their t statistics: t =  
b and ta = a/sa 
 the R squared 
The standard errors and the t stats provide measures of precision of 
your estimates. 
The R squared tells you how much of the randomness in the depen
dent variable y is explained by the explanatory variable x.</text>

          <text>This class covers only one version of the CAPM, assuming unre
stricted borrowing. 
 In practice, borrowing restrictions are realistic. It includes margin 
rules, bankruptcy laws that limit lender access to a borrowers future 
income, etc. 
 Fisher Black showed that borrowing restrictions might cause low- 
stocks to have higher expected returns than the CAPM predicts.</text>

          <text>Back to testing the CAPM
The implication of the CAPM: 
i  rf = 0 + 1i (20) 
Our data ( ) on the 43 industrial portfolios tell us that this relation ,  
does not hold exactly . 
One possibilit y: our measures of the expected returns are contaminated 
by noises that are unrelated to the s. 
What we still like to know: 
 On average, is reward related to risk at all? 1 =0 or not ? 
 On average, does zero risk result in zero reward? 0 = 0 or not? 
 On average, does one unit of risk exposure pay the market return? 
1 = M  rf =5.9% or not? (21)</text>

t 1 
N (rt,M  M ) (17)

t 1 
N cov (rM ,ri)= (rt,M  M )(rt,i  i) (18) 
We have
cov (rM ,ri) (19) var (ri) i = 
Intuitively, b is a measure of the covariance cov(x,y) between x and 
y, scaled by the variance var(x) of x.</text>

          <text>Predictions and Applications
 Predictions: 
 CAPM: In market equilibrium, investors are only rewarded for 
bearing the market risk. 
 APT: In the absence of arbitrage, investors are only rewarded 
for bearing the factor risk. 
 Applications: 
 professional portfolio managers: evaluating securit y returns and 
fund performance. 
 regulatory commissions: cost of capital for regulated rms. 
 court rulings: evaluating claims of lost future income. 
 corporate manager: capital budgeting decisions.</text>

Could there be other risk factors?

          <text>Regression: The Solution 
Solving for the optimization problem, we get: 
 an estimate b for the slope coecien t b: 
b =
N 
i=1 (yi  y)(xi  x)N 
i=1 (xi  x) (14)
 an estimate a for the intercept a: a = y  bx 
Notice the familiar notation for sample means: 
x = 1 
N T 
t xi y = 1 
N T 
t yi (15) 
Why do we call our solutions estimates? Why put hats on b and a? 
Do we always get b that is close to the real b, a hat is close to the 
real a? 
In the large sample (large N), we are pretty conden t that they do, 
why?</text>

          <slideno>19</slideno>
          <text>A Rule of Thumb with t-Stat
To get a sense of how an estimate, say b, diers signican tly from zero, 
its t-stat tb is the most telling statistics. 
A Rule of Thumb: think of tb as standard normal (not a bad assumption 
for a large sample). The larger the magnitude (absolute value) of b, the 
more likely it is signican tly dieren t from zero. 
Hypothesis Testing: The null:  b = 0. b = 0, the alternativ e:  
1. A t-stat of 1.960 rejects the null with signicance level 5%; 
2. A t-stat of 2.576 rejects the null with signicance level 1%; 
For example, t1 =0.1, what can we say about 1? What about 1?</text>

          <text>Testabilit y of CAPM and APT
The wide acceptance of the CAPM and APT makes it all the more im
portant to test their predictions empirically .
Recall from Class 6, both theories build on assumptions that are un
realistic at times.
How does a product of abstract reasoning hold in reality?
Unfortunately , the predictions of the CAMP and APT are hard to test
empirically:
 Neither the market portfolio in CAPM nor the risk factor in APT is 
observ able. 
 Expected returns are unobserv able, and could be time varying. 
 Volatilit y is not directly observ able, and is time varying.</text>

          <text>Regression: Motiv ation
Some motivating examples: 
1. On day i, xi is the temperature at Orlando, yi is the price of the 
futures contract on frozen concen trated orange juice. 
2. For rm i, xi is its leverage ratio, yi is its probabilit y of default. 
3. On day i, xi is the Fed fund target rate, yi is the 3 month T bill rate. 
4. At the i-th second, xi is the number of packets sent by rgallati@mit.edu 
to jcox@mit.edu, yi is the number of packets receiv ed by the latter. 
In each case, the outcome of x might contribute to the outcome of y: 
yi = a + b  xi + i (12) 
but there might be other random factors, captured by i, that have noth
ing to do with x. The slope coecien t b is of particular interest as it 
measures the sensitivit y of y to x.</text>

where

From our earlier derivation, we know that: 
E(ry )=0.07 + 0.08  y; var(ry )=0.222  y 2 (18) 
Our optimization problem therefore becomes max f (y):

          <text>A Little History
In March 1952, Harry Markowitz, a 25 year old graduate studen t from the University 
of Chicago, published Portfolio Selection in the Journal of Finance. 
The paper opens with: The process of selecting a portfolio may be divided into two 
stages. The rst stage starts with observ ation and experience and ends with beliefs 
about the future performances of available securities. The second stage starts with the 
relevant beliefs about future performances and ends with the choice of portfolio. 
Thirty eight years later, this paper would earn him a Nobel Prize in economic sci
ences.</text>

Overall, investors are risk averse, although some are more so than the others. We next 
consider the rule that the investor does (or should) consider expected return a desirable 
thing and varianc e of return an undesir able thing. -Markowitz (1952). 
Heterogeneit y of investors: 
 individual investors vs. corporations 
 investors with dieren t marginal tax rates 
 informed vs. uninformed 
 young vs. old

If the risk premium, E (rp)-rf , of the original risky asset decreases, a risk-averse 
investor will reduce his holdings in the risky asset accordingly . 
If the original asset is risky (with var(rp) &gt; 0), but pays zero risk premium, then 
no risk-averse investor will hold the risky asset. If the risk premium is negativ e, a 
risk-averse investor will start shorting the asset.

y may vary over the entire positive real line, but this relation holds regardless.

          <text>Going Beyond
Our setup assumes the following: 
1. A mean variance investor; 
2. Investmen t horizon is xed to one year; 
3. No dynamic rebalancing in between. 
Of course, this setup is a very rough characterization of the real investmen t problem. 
Nevertheless, this example is valuable: 
	First, it provides a framew ork for us to think about the portfolio optimization 
problem. 
 Second, although simple, it provides rich intuition. 
Now we can go beyond to the next step.</text>

          <text>The Sharp e Ratio
One measure of the attractiv eness of a portfolio r is its Sharp e Ratio (S): 
Intuitively, S measures extra return per extra risk. 
E (r)  rfS = (13)std (r) 
Recall that the CAL can be re-written as: 
E (ry )  rf = E (ry )  rf std (ry ) (14)std (rp) 
For the extra risk std (ry ) chosen (through y), the extra reward is: Sp  std(r y ). 
Moreo ver, the Sharp Ratio Sy of any portfolio thus constructed from rf and rp is 
the same: 
Sy = Sp = E (ry )  rf (15)std (rp) 
for any y  0. Does that make sense to you?</text>

          <text>Building Zero Curves
The coupon-bearing T-notes and bonds can be thought of as packages of zero-coupon 
securities. 
For any time t, a zero-curve builder uses all such coupon-bearing securities traded 
in the market at time t to calculate the zero-coupon rates rt,t+n for all possible matu-
rities n. 
A sophisticated procedure will take into account of the illiquidity and mis-pricing of 
bonds, as well as tax-related issues. 
In recent years coupon-bearing securities have been stripped into simpler packages 
of zero-coupon securities. 
For example, a 5-year T-note can be divided up and sold as 10 separate zero-coupon 
bonds, or as a strip of coupon payments and a ve-year zero-coupon bond.</text>

          <text>Convexity
The duration should not be used for big swings in the term structure. The accuracy 
of the estimation of the duration-coecient depends on the convexity. Duration is 
an approximate estimate of a convex form with a linear function. The stronger the 
yield-curve is curved, the more the real value deviates from the estimated values. 
We receive a better estimate applying the rst two moments of a Taylor-expansion 
to estimate the price changes: 
dP 1 d2P dP = dr +  dr2 +  (25)dr 2 dr2 
 is the residual part of the Taylor expansion and d2P is the second derivative of the dr2 
bond price relative to the yield. Dividing both parts by the price we obtain: 
dP dP 1 1 d2P =  dr + +  (26)P d r P 2 dr2 
Replacing the second derivative of the price equation and reformulating the notation 
of the Taylor-expansion, we get: 
T 1 dP 1  t CF t 1 dP =    2 dr 1+ r (1 + rt)t P t=1 
11 1 1 2 CF1 2 3 CF2 T (T +1 ) CF t =   + + + T2 P (1 + r)2 (1 + r) (1 + r)2 (1 + r)
T 11 1  t (t +1 ) CF t =    2 P (1 + r)2 
t=1 (1 + r)t (27) 
The notation of the price-convexity results from the Taylor-expansion. The rst part is 
the approximation based on the duration. The second part is an approximation based 
on the convexity of the price/yield-relationship. The percent-approximation results 
from the duration and the convexity by summing up the individual components. 
The convexity is dened as: 
1 d2P 1 convexity =   (28)2 dr2 P</text>

          <text>Yield to Maturity
The yield to maturity (YTM) is the interest rate that makes the present value of a 
bonds payment equal to its price: 
10 c  100 P =  2 t +  
1+ YT M 10 (5) 
1+ YT M 
i=1 2 2 
where bond has T-year to maturity and pays semiannual coupon with rate c%:
If the interest rate is a constant r, then the YTM equals r;
In practice, the interest rate is not a constant; The time-t n-year zero-coupon rate
rt,t+n varies over time t, and across maturity n; 
Intuitively, the YTM for a T-year bond is a weighted average of all zero-coupon rate
rt,t+n between n =0 a n d n = T ;
What is the dierence between the YTM and the holding period return for the same
bond?</text>

          <text>2. The number of contracts to buy/sell for optimal protection. 
Solution: 
1. The notional of the futures contract is: 
(93 + 2/32)/100  $100/prime000 = $93/prime062.5 (21) 
2. The number of contracts to buy/sell for optimal protection. 
 N =  DS  S 
DF  F =  6.8  $10/prime000/prime000 
9.2  $93/prime062.5 (22) 
Note that DVBP of the futures is 9.2  $93/prime062.5  0.01% = $85 
Example 2: On February 2, a corporate treasurer wants to hege a July 17 issue of $ 
5 mio. of CP with a maturity of 180 days, leading to anticipated proceeds of $ 4.52 
mio. The September Eurodollar futures trades at 92, and has a notional amount of $ 
1m i o . 
Compute: 
1. The current dollar value of the of the futures contract; 
2. The number of contracts to buy/sell for optimal protection. 
Solution: 
1. The current dollar value is given by: 
$10/prime000  (100  0.25  (100  92)) = $980/prime000 (23) 
Note that the duration of futures is 3 months, since this contract refers to 3-month 
LIBOR. 
2. If rates increase, the cost of borrowing will be higher. We need to oset this by a 
gain, or a short position in the futures. The optimal number of contracts is: 
DS  S 180  $4/prime520/prime000/prime000 N =  =  = 9.2 (24) DF  F 90  $980/prime000 
Note that DVBP of the futures is 0.25  $1/prime000/prime000  0.01% = $25</text>

          <text>Liquidit y Preference and Yield Curve
Investors prefer to preserv e their liquidit y and invest funds for short pe
riods of time. 
Borrowers, on the other hand, usually prefer to borrow at xed rates 
for long periods of time. 
In practice, to match depositors with borrowers and avoid interest rate 
risk, nancial intermediaries raise long-term interest rates relativ e to ex
pected future short-term interest rates. 
This strategy reduces the demand for long-term xed-rate borrowing 
and encourages investors to deposit their funds for the long-term.</text>

          <text>Market Segmen tation and Yield Curve
Dieren t institutions invest in bonds of dieren t maturities and do not 
switch maturities. 
The short-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in 
the short-term bond market; the medium-term interest rate is deter-
mined by supply and demand in the medium-term bond market; . . . 
There need be no relationship between short-, medium-, and long-term 
interest rates.</text>

          <text>Forward Rates
A forward interest rate is the interest rate implied by curren t zero rates 
for a specied future time period. 
Let rt,n1 and rt,n2 be the zero rates for maturities n1, and n2, respec
tively. The forward rate for the period of time between t + nl and t + n2: 
f n1,n2 n2  rt,n2  n1t,n1 (10) = t n2  n1 
It is important to note that the forward rate ftn1,n2 is known at time t.</text>

          <text>Yield Curve and Expectations Hypothesis
The expectations hypothesis can be stated in the following two equiva
lent ways: 
1. The N-period yield is the average of expected future one-period yields: 
1   
rt,N = N  Et rt,(1) + rt+1,(1) +  + rt+N 1,(1) (11) 
2. The forward rate equals the expected future spot rate: 
ftN,N +1 = Et rt+N,(1) (12) 
Implications: a positive yield spread must be associated with rising in
terest rates.</text>

Your customer has $ 10 mio. in his accoun t with no use. You can oer
your customer to buy the securit y for you and you will repurc hase the
securit y from him tomorro w. Repo rate 6.5%.
Compute: What is the prot for the client allowing such a transaction?
Solution: Then your customer will pay $ 9998185 for the securit y and
you will return him $ 10 mio. tomorro w.
0.065 $9998185  = $1805 (13)360

1. the expected return is desirable;

          <text>Formalizing the Problem
As before, we calculate the utility U (ry ) of an investor who invests a fraction y of his 
wealth in the risky asset rp, leaving the rest in the riskfree accoun t rf : 
ry = rf + y  (rp  rf ) (10) 
Two old pieces of U	(ry ): 
E (ry )=0.07 + 0.08  y; var (ry )=0.222  y 2 (11) 
The new piece of U (ry ): 
E (ry  E (ry ))3 = y 3  Ep  E((rp)3 (12) 
Recall that by denition 
E (x  E (x))3 = skew (x)  std (x)3 (13) 
we therefore have: 
E (ry  E (ry ))3 =0.223  (2)  (y)3 (14)</text>

Green wich, CT: 
When he saw the quotation for U.S. swap spreads, he stared at his screen in dis
belief. On an active day, U. S. swap spreads might change by as much as a point. But 
on this morning, swap spreads were wildly oscillating over a range of 20 points. That 
Friday, Long? Term lost money wherever it looked. Credit spreads simply exploded. ? 
Though these moves may seem small in absolute terms, the eect on Long? Term was 
magnie d by the funds potent level of leverage and its immense position size. Long-
Term, which had calculate d with such mathematic al certainty that it was unlikely to 
lose more than $35 million on any single day, had just dropped $553 million on that 
one Friday in August.

1. Investor has a preference for skewness; 
U (r)= E (r) 
1  A  var (r)+ 2 1  B  E (r  E (r))3 (7)6 
2. The risky asset rP is negativ ely skewed:

The optimization problem:

          <text>Determinan ts of Optimal Allocation
What we already know: 
1. a more variance-a verse investor tends to invest less in the risky asset: A  y  
2. given a higher risk premium, a risk-averse investor will invest more in the risky 
 asset: (E(rp)  rf )  y  
3. given the same risk premium, if the risky asset becomes more volatile, a risk-averse 
investor will reduce his holdings in it: std(r p)  y  
New Results 
An investor who is more averse to negativ e skewness tends to invest less in a negativ ely 
skewed risky asset: B  y 
Given the same risk premium and volatilit y, if a risky asset becomes more negativ ely
skewed, an investor with skewness preference will reduce his holdings: skew(rp)  y

Empirical Factors: price-to-earning ratios, strategies based on ve-year sales growth, 
etc. 
Macro economic Factors: labor income, industrial production, ination, investmen t 
growth, consumption wealth ratio, etc. 
The Market Skewness Factor: 
	If asset returns have systematic skewness, expected returns should include rewards 
for accepting this risk. 
 Co-Sk ewness: the level of exposure to the systematic skewness. 
	Harvey and Siddique (Journal of Financ e 2000) report that systematic skewness 
is economically important and commands an average risk premium of 3.60 per 
year. 
Long-T erm Reversals 
Firms whose three- and ve-year returns are high (low) tend to have low (high) returns 
in subsequen t years. 
Firms with low (high) BE/ME, E/P, CF/P, D/P, and prior sales growth tend to have 
low (high) returns in subsequen t years. 
All these patterns seem to be manifestations of the same value vs. growth phenomenon. 
This reversal eect makes sense given return predictabilit y and mean-rev ersion, and 
is explained by the Fama-F rench three factor model. 
Short-T erm Momen tum 
Firms with high returns in the prior year tend to have high returns in the next few 
months. 
Firms with low short-term returns tend to have low returns in subsequen t months.</text>

          <text>The Pricing Relation
Using the intuition of the CAPM, the reward for asset i should be related to its expo-
sure to the market risk, as well as its exposure to the systematic risks. 
Given the risk premia of the systematic factors, e.g., m and F , the determinan ts of 
expected returns: 
E (ri,t1  rf,t)= i  M + fi  F (1) 
Without the systematic factors F, we are back to the CAPM. 
What are the additional systematic factors? 
The intuition of the CAPM: these factors should be proxies for the real, macro eco
nomic, aggregate, non-div ersiable risk.</text>

Equities are common stocks, represen ting ownership shares of a corporation. Two 
important characteristics: 
 limited liabilit y: non-negativ e stock prices, 
 residual claim: equities are inheren tly more risky than xed income securities. 
In most countries, the equity market is perhaps the most popular venue of investmen ts 
for individual investors. It also remains to be an important component of institutional 
investmen ts. We will examine the equity market from two perspectives: 
 cross-sectional (Classes 8 &amp; 9 ), and 
 time-series (Class 10).</text>

Start with the one-factor empirical model: 
ri,t  rf,t = i + i (rM,t  rf,t)+ fiFt + i,t (2) 
 For each portfolio i, we perform the above regression and obtain an estimate i of 
the factor loading i. This regression procedure is equivalent to constructing sample 
estimates for i, why?

          <text>Summary
The cross-sectional variation in stock returns cannot be fully explained by beta. Adding 
additional factors (size and value) helps. 
While the risk premium associated with the beta risk has its theoretical foundation in 
the CAPM, the premia associated with the size and value factors do not. 
There are many other puzzling patterns in stock returns, some of which are hard 
to reconcile with market eciency .

tendency to move with multiple risk factors: 
ri,t1  rf,t = i + i (rM,t  rf,t)+ fiFt + i,t 
	1. Systematic Factors: 
rM,t : risk premium M = E (rM,t  rf ) 
Ft : risk premium F = E (Ft) 
	2. Idiosyncratic Factors:

          <text>The Factor Premia
Using monthly returns from 1963 to 2000, the (annualized) premia for the three factors 
are: 
Factor Estimate S.E. t-stat 
Market 6% 2.5% 2.5% 
SMB 1.9% 1.9% 1% 
HML 5% 2% 2.6% 
The Market Risk Premium 
The market risk premium has its foundation in the CAPM. 
Investors are risk averse. They are worried about holding stocks that do badly at the 
times when the market does badly. 
The market risk premium is a reward for holding the market risk.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>14</slideno>
          <text>What are the Size and Value Factors?
Unlike the market portfolio, the Size and Value portfolios are empirically motivated. 
Where do the size and value premia come from? 
If we think of them as risk premia, then we need to understand the real, macro eco
nomic, aggregate, non-div ersiable risk that is proxied by the SMB and HML portfolios. 
In particular, why are investors so concerned about holding stocks that do badly at 
the times that the hml and smb portfolios do badly, even though the market does not 
fall? 
Some Explanations 
Value: proxies for the distress risk. 
Size: proxies for the illiquidit y of the stock. 
HML and SMB contain information above and beyond that in the market return for 
forecasting GDP growth. 
Proxies for variables that forecast time-v arying investmen t opportunities or time-v arying 
risk aversion. 
Over-reaction: earnings announcemen ts. 
Seasonal: the January eect.

          <text>1. The notional of the futures contract 
2.	the optimal number of contracts to hedge the beta-exp osure against adverse mar
ket movements. 
Solution: 
1. The notional of the futures contract is: 
$250  1400 = $350000 (13) 
2.	the optimal number of contracts to hedge the beta-exp osure against adverse mar
ket movements is: 
N
 =    P
F
= 
1.5  $10000000 
1  $350000 = 42.9 (14)
However: 
A typical US stock has a correlation of 50% with the S&amp;P 500-index. Using the
regression eectiveness we nd that the volatilit y of the hedged portfolio is still about
(1  0.52 = 87%) of the unhedged volatilit y for a typical stock.
If we wish to hedge an industry index with S&amp;P futures, the correlation is about 75%
and the unhedged volatilit y is 66% of its original level.
The lower number shows that stock market hedging is more eectiv e for diversied
portfolios.</text>

The major nancial statemen ts: 
 The income statemen t is a summary of the protabilit y of the rm 
over a period of time, such as a year. 
 The balance sheet provides a list of the rms assets and liabilities 
at a particular time, say the year-end. 
 The cash-o w statemen t details the cash ow generated by the rms

          <text>The Gordon Model
Using all of the information available at time 0, the market participan ts 
agree that: 
1. the dividend growth is constan t 
EDn = D0 (1 + g)n (5) 
2. the expected return is constan t 
ERn = k (6) 
where g  0 and k  0. 
This implies that 
  n  1+ gV0 = D0 (7)1+ k n=1

Analysts
One of the main determinan ts of a rms value is its investmen t oppor
tunity, which can be aected by macro-economic variables as well as the 
condition of the industry . 
Focusing on each rm, however, its projected earnings are among the 
most informativ e in predicting the growth opportunit y of a rm. 
For this reason, the stock market analysts, as well as investors, pay 
close attention to rms quarterly earnings reports. 
In addition, nancial analysts invest a great deal of time and energy 
in forecasting rms future earnings.</text>

          <text>The Presen t Value Model
To determine the price of a treasury bond, we calculate the presen t value 
of future cash ow. 
In principle, one can apply the same approac h to stock valuation, think
ing of the future dividend as a stream of coupon payments. Additional 
issues needed to be addressed: 
 Unlike the coupon payments, the dividend payouts are uncertain. 
What are the appropriate discoun t rates? 
 Dividends are known to be sticky, and some rms do not even pay 
dividends. Where do we get information about the growth compo
nent of a rm? 
 Unlike xed-income securities, stocks do not have maturit y dates. 
How do we take care of dividend payments that are postponed into 
the innite future?</text>

          <text>Introduction
What explains the price we observ e from the market? 
In an ecien t market, the price reects all information available to pub
lic. Implicitly , there should be a pricing model that links the market 
information to the market price. 
Gathering all of the relevant information, processing it through some 
pricing model, we have something to say about what the price of a se
curity should be. 
If the market is ecien t, and our pricing model is right, then we will 
be in agreemen t with the market. 
What if we disagree? Either our pricing model is wrong, or the mar
ket price is wrong. 
What Information to Use? 
1. The broad economic environmen t (a) The global econom y (b) The 
domestic econom y: GDP, emplo yment, ination, interest rates, bud-
get decit, consumer condence index, the business cycle, economic 
indicators. (c) Federal governmen t policy: scal policy, monetary 
policy, supply-side policies.</text>

Cash Cow: 100% dividend payout ratio. It provides a stream of divi
dends E(Dn) = $5, maintaining a zero dividend growth g = 0. 
$5 V cc = 0 kcc(13) 
Growth Prosp ects: 40% dividend payout ratio. In any given year, it 
plows back (1 -40%) of its earnings to a project generating an ex
pected return of k per year. That is, E(D1) = $5  40% and E(D2)= 
($5 + $5  (1  40%)  k)  40%, maintaining a dividend growth rate of 
g = (1  40%)  k . 
What are the expected returns kCC and kGP ? 
For example,  
kcc = E P cc + Dcc  P cc

          <text>Ination and the Stock Market
Ination neutral: changes in the rate of ination, whether expected or 
unexp ected, ought to have no eect on the expected real rate of return 
on common stocks. 
This is consisten t with the wisdom that common stock, represen ting 
ownership of the income generated by real assets, should be a hedge 
against ination. 
Empirically , however there is much evidence that common stock returns 
and ination are negativ ely related during the post-1953 period. Possible 
explanations: 
1. Stagation: negativ e correlation between ination and real activit y. 
2. Increased uncertain ty when ination is high, inducing a higher re
quired rate of return.</text>

          <text>Monetary Policy and the Econom y
Using the tools of monetary policy, the Fed can aect the volume of 
money and credit and their price/in terest levels. 
The initial link between monetary policy and the econom y occurs in the 
market for reserv es. The Fed policies inuence the demand for or supply 
of reserv es at banks and other depository institutions, and through this 
market, the eects of monetary policy are transmitted to the rest of the 
econom y. 
A change in the reserv es market will trigger a chain of events that aect 
other short-term interest rates, foreign exchange rates, long-term inter
est rates, and the amoun t of money and credit in the econom y, and levels 
of emplo yment, output, and prices.</text>

          <text>Credit Swap Valuation
Dene the credit event time as the time when rm XYZ defaults. Use 
the model of constant default intensity: 
For simplicity, lets assume risk neutral pricing, and constant risk free 
rate r.L e t at() be the time O value of receiving $ 1 at the end of year 
t in the event that default is after that date: 
Let bt() be the time O value of receiving $ 1 at the end of year t 
in the event that default happens in year t: 
bt()= r eP r o b (t1  T&lt; t) (1) 
  
= rt e (t 1) e t e (2) 
The time O value of an annuity of $ 1 paid at the end of each year until 
default or maturity , whichever comes rst, is 
A0 = al()+ a2 ()+ + a() (3) 
The time O value of a $ 1 payment made at the end of the rms default 
year, provided the default date is before the maturity date ,i s 
B0 = bl()+ b2 ()+ + b() (4) 
Suppose that the loss of face value at default carries no risk premium 
and, has an expected value of f. The time 0 value of the default swap is 
V0 = B0 f A0 U (5)

          <text>Economic Principles of Credit Risk
Several Economic principles distinguish credit risk from other types of 
market risk, and might thereby inuence the choice of risk measurements 
and techniques for risk mitigation: 
 Adverse selection: setting credit exposure limits; 
 Winners curse: setting limits on credit risk concentrations (by in-
dustry, by geographic location, by credit rating, etc.); 
 Moral hazard: limit borrowers access to credit.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>11</slideno>
          <text>Mitigating Adverse Selection
In general, adverse selection cannot be eliminated by securitization of 
assets in a CDO, but it can mitigated. 
The seller achieves a higher total valuation (for what is sold and what 
is retained) by designing the CDO structure so as to concentrate the 
lemons problem into small subordinate tranches, leaving the large se-
nior tranch relatively immune to the eects of adverse selection. 
The large senior tranche can therefore be sold at a small lemons pre-
mium. 
The issuer can retain signicant fractions of smaller subordinate tranches 
that are more subject to adverse selection.</text>

          <text>Measuring Credit Risk
For the purpose of measuring features of the distribution of P&amp;L, credit 
risk should be viewed and computed as part of market risk. 
At the same time, the measurement of credit risk provides its own set of 
challenges because many credit sensitive instruments are relatively illiq-
uid, remain on a rms books, and cannot be reliably marked to market 
without modeling the default process. 
Moreover, the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection recom -
mend the use of limits on the bilateral exposures to counterparties.</text>

          <text>Why CDO?
In perfect capital markets, CDOs would serve no purpose; the costs of 
constructing and marketing a CDO would inhibit its creation. 
In practice, CDOs address some important market imperfections. 
First, banks and certain other nancial institutions have regulatory cap-
ital requirements that make it valuable for them to securitize and sell 
some portion of their assets, reducing the amount of (expensive) regula -
tory capital that they must hold. 
Second, individual bonds or loans my be illiquid, leading to a reduc-
tion in their market values. Securitization may improve liquidity, and 
thereby raise the total valuation to the issuer of the CDO structure.</text>

          <text>Introduction
Credit derivatives are nancial instruments whose payos are linked to 
certain credit events. 
A commonly stipulated credit event is default by a named issuer, which 
could be a corporation or a sovereign issuer. 
More generally, credit events can be dened in terms of downgrade, 
merger, cross default, failure to pay, restructuring, etc. 
According to a survey by the British Bankers Association, the credit 
derivatives market accounted for an estimated $ 586 billion at the end 
of 1999. It is predicted to reach $ 1.58 trillion by 2002. 
Some key credit derivative instruments: credit swap, total return swaps, 
collateralized debt obligations, spread options, etc.</text>

          <text>Use, Credit Swap to Mitigate Credit Risk
Credit risk often emerges whenever a corporation enters into long term 
business relationships with large customers or suppliers. 
For example, a credit exposure arises when a company has a long term 
product delivery contract with a customer in exchange for a future cash-
ow stream. 
This exposure can be particularly pronounced if a large upfront invest -
ment is required. 
To mitigate such credit risk, the company can purchase a credit swap, 
whose payo is linked to the credit event of its customer.</text>

          <text>Credit Risk Value and VaR
One can extend the methodology for estimation of portfolio market risk 
measures, such as VaR, so as to include credit risk: 
 Catalog the sensitivities of all positions to uctuations in market 
value due to 1. changes in underlying market wide risk factors (such 
as prices,rates, market credit spreads, and volatilities) 2. counter-
party specic uctuations in credit quality 
 Applying a risk model for changes in market wide risk factors and 
counterparty specic credit quality, estimate the overall risk all po-
sitions, allowing for correlation.</text>

          <text>Modeling Correlated Defaults
There are N counterparties, each with some default intensity i. 
We dial in correlations between default intensity by allowing for common 
credit events, arriving according to some intensity process c. 
At the arrival of a common credit event, all counterparties are exposed 
(with probability p) to immediate default. 
Eectively, there are two components to the default intensity of coun-
terparty i: 
i = iI + pc (7) 
where I is the default intensity specic to counterparty i. i</text>

          <text>Adverse Selection
There may be a signicant amount of private information regarding the 
credit quality of a junk bond or a bank loan. An investor may be con-
cerned about being picked o when trading such instruments. 
Given the risk of being picked o, the buyer oers a price that, on 
average, is below the price at which the asset would be sold in a setting 
of symmetric information. 
This reduction in price due to adverse selection is sometimes called a 
lemons premium.</text>

          <text>Measuring Credit Exposures
Regulators require nancial institutions to measure both current and 
potential future exposure. Guidelines are set forth by both the DPG and 
BIS. For example, the DPG guidelines provide the following denitions: 
Yt +  Current Exposure: Xt = for a position t with market value 
Yt,w h e r e Yt is the combination of all positions subject to bi-lateral 
netting agreements with one counterparty. 
 Potential Exposure: the 99% worst case exposure. 
 Aggregating Credit Risks: adding current and potential exposures, 
and then multiplying by an applicable default ratio for the counter-
party.</text>

          <text>Collateralized Debt Obligations
A CDO is an asset backed security whose underlying collateral is typi-
cally a portfolio of bonds (corporate or sovereign) or bank loans. 
A CDO cashow structure allocates interest income and principal repay-
ments from a collateral pool of dierent debt instruments to a prioritized 
collection (tranches) of CDO securities.

          <text>Credit Switches
While both single name credit default swaps and synthetic securitizations 
are eective in transferring credit risk from one risk taker to another, 
there is often signicant cost associated with these transactions. 
Instead of eliminating the credit exposures, a corporation can retain 
the same amount of credit risk, but use zero cost credit switches to di-
versify the credit portfolio. 
For example, one can use credit switches to diversify credit risks across 
dierent industries.</text>

          <text>Specialized Measures of Credit Risk
There are reasons (e.g., adverse selection and moral hazard) to track 
credit risk, by counterparty, that go beyond the contribution made by 
credit risk to overall market risk. To better understand the nature of 
the exposures to credit risk, risk managers have explored several com-
plementary measures of credit risk, including: 
 Market value of default loss 
 Exposure: the risk that ones exposure to a given counterparty (or 
within a given concentration area) excess a given threshold. 
In addition to these, and other, internal measures of credit risk, nan-
cial institutions are required to measure and report credit risk to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities.</text>

          <text>Exposure Disclosure
The DPG recommends reporting of: 
 the top 20 credit exposures, by counterparty; 
 aggregate credit risk organized by the 3 categories net replacement 
value, gross replacement value, and new exposure; 
 aggregate credit risk organized by the 3 classes credit rating of 
counterparty, counterparty industry sector and counterparty ge-
ographic location 
Large broker dealers of OTC derivatives commonly report, to the public, 
the current replacement cost of their portfolios as a measure of credit 
risk.</text>

          <text>The Bottom Line
The ecien t market hypothesis is a useful framew ork for modelling nancial markets. 
Like any model, the ecien t market hypothesis is not a perfect description of re
ality; some prices are almost certainly wrong. 
However, it would be naive to think that prices are always wrong or that it is easy to 
exploit pricing errors.  Instead of asking whether or not the market is ecien t, the 
more relevant questions are: 
 how ecien t is the market? 
 how does the market react to new information arrivals? and why? 
 what are the mechanisms that bring market prices to fundamen tal values?</text>

Arbitrage plays a critical role in the analysis of securities markets, because its eect is 
to bring prices to fundamen tal values and to keep market ecien t. 
The textbook example assumes that the arbitrageur has access to innite amoun t 
of capital. 
In practice, the arbitrageurs are capital constrained, and their eectiv eness in bringing 
prices to fundamen tal values is limited. Mutual</text>

The Weak Form of Eciency: Prices accurately reect all in-formation that can be 
derived by examining market trading data such as past prices, trading volume, short 
interest, etc. 
The Semi-strong Form of Eciency: Prices accurately reect all public available 
information, including past prices, fundamen tal data on the rms product line, quality 
of managemen t, balance sheet composition, patents held, accoun ting practices, earning 
forecasts, etc. 
The Strong Form of Eciency: Prices accurately reect all information that is 
known by any one, including inside information.

An ineciency ought to be an exploitable opportunit y. If there is nothing investors 
can properly exploit in a systematic way, time in and time out, then its very hard to 
say that information is not being properly incorp orated into stock prices.

          <text>Questions for the Next Class
Please read BKM Chapters 9-11, Roll and Ross (1995) and Kritzman (1991), and think 
about the following questions: 
The separation principle implies that every investor, regardless of his degree of risk 
aversion, will hold the same optimal risky portfolio. What implication does this result 
have on the entire market? Suppose there are I investors in the market. Each investor i 
has? a risk aversion coecient Aj , with optimal exposure to the optimal risky portfolio. 
 E (rp)  rf y = (20)i var (rp)  Ai 
In equilibrium, adding yi across all investors, what do we get?, (Hint: In equilibrium, 
supply equals demand, e.g., the amount of borrowing equals that of lending.)</text>

          <text>The Optimal Portfolio in Practice
Implication of the Separation Principle: A portfolio manager will oer the same risky 
portfolio to all clients. 
In practice, dierent managers focus on dierent subsets of the whole universe of nan-
cial assets, derive dierent ecient frontiers, and oer dierent optimal portfolios to 
their clients.Why? 
The theory of portfolio selection builds on many simplifying assumptions: 
	No Market Frictions (tax, transactions costs, limited divisibility of nancial assets, 
market segmentation). 
	No Heterogeneity in Investors (e.g. rich vs. poor, informed vs. uninformed, young 
vs. old). 
	Static expected returns and variance - no forecastability in returns or volatility 
(e.g. nancial analysts, accounting information, macro?economic variables do not 
play any role in making an investment decision). 
Our next step toward reality (in Classes 19-20): link the following two bodies of ideas, 
	Security Analysis: subjective, judgmental 
	Portfolio Selection: objective, statistical. 
Some important questions to think about: 
	Can security analysis improve portfolio performance? 
	How do analysts opinions enter in security selection?</text>

          <text>Multiple Risky Assets
The opportunity set generated by the two risky assets is relatively simple. As we gen-
eralize to the case of multiple risky assets, the opportunity set becomes considerably 
more complicated. Suppose that we have n securities, whose random returns are de-
noted by r1, r2, ..., rn 
As usual, we construct portfolios by mixing these n securities: 
rp = w1 r1 + w2 r2 + + wn rn (10) 
where the ws are the portfolio weights, adding up to 1. 
Each chosen w gives rise to an investment opportunity with 
n  
E (rp)= wi E (ri) (11) 
i=1 
n n  
var (rp)= wi wj cov (ri,rj ) (12) 
i=1 j=1 
 n 1 covi,j = n (ri r i) (rj r j ) equal weighted (13) 
i=1 
n  
covi,j = pt (ri r i) (rj r j ) probability weighted (14) 
i=1 
This results in an enormous degree of freedom, and a very rich opportunity set. Of 
course, not all portfolios in the opportunity set are good deals.

the lowest possible risk for any given target rate of return.</text>

          <text>The Separation Principle
In addition to the choice variable y, which controls the investors overall exposure to 
risk, our current problem also involves the choice variable w, which controls the right 
mix of the risky assets. 
The Complication: Need to solve y and w simultaneously in the optimization problem: 
max U (ry,w)	 (7) 
y  R,w  R 
Solution: The Separation Principle (James Tobin 1958): 
	the choice y of the overall risk exposure is investor specic, depending on his 
degree of risk aversion; 
	the choice w of the optimal risky portfolio is the same for all investors.</text>

          <text>A Digression to Diversication
Diversication is a universal concept. Put in simple terms, one should not put all eggs 
in one basket. 
In investments, diversifying means holding similar amounts of many risky assets in-
stead of concentrating all of your investment in only one. 
In social science, it is believed that individuals are of bounded rationality. One way 
to mitigate such a problem is through decision-making by multiple agents. 
For example, in gymnastics or gure skating competitions, the score is averaged over 
multiple judges, after taking away extremes on either end. 
The mathematical foundation of diversication - the strong law of large numbers!

Each CAL is uniquely identied by its slope. 
The best CAL is the one with the steepest slope, or the highest Sharpe Ratio. 
The Optimal Risky Portfolio is the Tangency Portfolio: the unique portfolio with 
the highest Sharpe-Ratio. 
Conceptually, it is very important to notice that the denition of the Optimal Risky 
Portfolio does not involve the degree of risk aversion of any individual investor. 
In such an ideal world, every investor, regardless of his level of risk aversion, will 
agree on the best CAL, and allocate his wealth between rf and the optimal risky port-
folio. 
The portion y invested in the optimal risky portfolio, however, will depend on each 
investors degree of risk aversion, as discussed in Class 3. 
In practice, however, dierent investors might have very dierent ideas about their 
Optimal Risky Portfolio. Why?</text>
