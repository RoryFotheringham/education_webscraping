PHASE TRANSITIONS : 
 Two major types: 
  CN number change  (atomic arrangement) 
  Structural change (bond lengths) 
Examples: Olivine  Wadsleyite (410 km):

          <text>Looks like ~ 5km from seismology; sm aller than predicted by mineral 
physics (~ 13 km) 
This could be due to: 
1.	the effects of iron (partitioning between different phases) 
2.	the effects of water 
3.	or the seismic signal may not record the en tire transition zone. For example, if we 
look at the details of the olivine-wadsle yite phase transition, the volume fraction 
of the coexisting phases that exist through the transition interval may not be linear 
with depth; therefore the de nsity contrast may not be linear with depth as well. 
What is the shape of the transition, and which part of it would we expect to be sensitive 
to with seismology? 
At what pressure (depth) does the post-spinel boundary occur? 
Irifune et al. 1998  ~600 km  ???
  How explain this?
T = 1200?!?!?  NO! 
   Different composition?

          <text>Summary of Dan Shims lecture on 3/1/05 
Phase transitions in the Earths mantle 
In this lecture, we focused on phase transi tions associated with the transition zone 
1. 410 km alpha olivine  beta wadsleyite 
2. 660 km gamma ringwoodite  perovskite 
3. D perovskite  post perovskite 
PREM  the large velocity jump at ~ 3000 km de pth corresponds to the CMB. This is 
the most significant discontinuity, because it  is a chemical transition, not isochemical. 
Smaller jumps at 410 and 660 km are associat ed with phase changes in the olivine 
[(Mg,Fe) 2SiO 4] system
 NAME STRUCTURE A.K.A. 
Olivine  phase 
Wadselyite modified spinel  phase 
Ringwoodite true spinel  phase 
* + Periclase Perovskite + NaCl 
 = perovskite doesnt have a name because it hasnt been observed in nature 
In the lower mantle, dominant mine ralogy is perovskite [(Mg,Fe)SiO 3] 
The pyrolite mantle consists of : 60% olivine and 40% pyroxene. 
Why do we have phase transitions at high P, T? 
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY REVIEW 
Highest efficient packing = Hexagonal Close Packed 
Close Packed structure has three sites:
  Tetrahedral Site: cati on surrounded by 4 oxygen (CN=4) 
Octahedral Site:    6  (CN=6) 
Dodecahedral   12  (CN=12) 
CN= coordination number  number of anions surrounding particular cation and 
can be 2  3  4  6  8  12. The availabl e site volume increas es with increasing 
coordination number; distance betwee n cation &amp; anion also increases

II) Constraints from Potassium content
K content of MORB source is 40-50 ppm; if representative of entire 
mantle produces 22-28 x 1018g of 40Ar
-significantly less than the 63-80 x 1018g of 40Ar calculated to 
be in the mantle
Bottom line : The constraints from 40Ar require some sort of layering or 
a hidden reservoir in the mantle
Any wiggle room? Maybe we do not know the K/U ratio of the 
mantle as well as we think (e.g., Lassiter 2004)</text>

He concentrations higher in

Maybe not too surprising 
since most OIBs are erupted 
at shallower water depths 
than MORBs; so would be 
degassed more

explanation is not really

The Ar concentration decreases with degassing as expected
For some MORBs suites, as 4He/40Ar ratio increases (more degassed), 
He concentration increases as well! ! So the problem appears to be 
with HeImage removed due to copyright considerations.

Maybe
Time integrated ratios however provide  some insights; for example high

          <text>He isotope ratios in ocean island basalts (OIBs)
OIBs display a very large range in 
He isotopic composition 
He isotopic distribution has a 
double-peak; maxima at 8 RA and 
13 RA
The first maxima is identical to 
the mean from MORBs
-Clear indication of the  
involvement of depleted mantle in 
ocean island volcanism
The 2ndpeak is somewhat 
surprising and its meaning is 
unclear

          <text>Partition coefficient of the noble gases
Are the noble gases (4He, 21Ne, 40Ar) really more incompatible than their 
radiogenic parents (e.g., U, Th, K)?
For clinopyroxene, Ar slightly  more incompati ble than K
Experimental data still not good enough to show  conclusively how He behaves with   
respect to U and Th
Time integrated ratios however provide  some insights; for example high 3He/4He  
ratios are never associated with the most de pleted isotopic signatures of Sr and Nd,   
=&gt; seems to impl y that He is mo re incompatible than U and Th
Proving that He is more or less incompatible than U and Th will be a major challenge 
but will have tremendous impl ications for mantle geodynamicsImage removed due to copyright considerations.
