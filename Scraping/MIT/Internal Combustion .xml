          <text>Turbulent Convective Heat Transfer Correlation 
Approach: Use Nusselt- Reynolds number correlations similar to 
those for turbulent pipe or flat plate flows. e.g. In-cylinder: 
hLNu   a(Re) 0.8 
 
h = Heat transfer coefficient 
L = Characteristic length (e.g. bore) 
Re= Reynolds number, UL/ 
U = Characteristic gas velocity 
 = Gas thermal conductivity 
 = Gas viscosity 
 = Gas density 
a = Turbulent pipe flow correlation coefficient

radiating particles (particu late matters) in the flame

          <text>Engine Heat Transfer: Impact 
 Efficiency and Power: Heat transfer in the in let decrease volumetric 
efficiency. In the cylinder, heat losses to the wall is a loss of 
availability. 
 Exhaust temperature : Heat losses to exhaust influence the 
turbocharger performance. In- c ylinder and exhaust system heat 
transfer has impact on catalyst light up. 
 Friction: Heat transfer governs liner, piston/ ring, and oil temperatures. It also affects pist on and bore distortion. All of these 
effects influence friction. Thermal loading determined fan, oil and 
water cooler capacities and pumping power. 
 Component design: The operating temperatures of critical engine components affects their durability; e.g. via mechanical stress, 
lubricant behavior 
3 
Engine Heat Transfer: Impact 
 Mixture preparation in SI engines: Heat transfer to the fuel 
significantly affect fuel evapor ation and cold start calibration 
 Cold start of diesel engines: The compression ratio of diesel 
engines are often governed by cold start requirement 
 SI engine octane requirement: Heat transfer influences inlet 
mixture temperature, chamber, cylinder head, liner, piston and 
valve temperatures, and therefor e end-gas temperatures, which 
affect knock. Heat transfer also affects build up of in-cylinder deposit which affects knock.

IC Engine heat transfer 
 Heat transfer mostly from hot burned gas 
 That from unburned gas is relatively small 
 Flame geometry and charge motion/turbulence
level affects heat transfer rate 
 Order of Magnitude 
 SI engine peak heat flux ~ 1-3 MW/m2 
 Diesel engine peak heat flux ~ 10 MW/m2 
 For SI engine at part load, a reduction in heat losses
by 10% results in an improvement in fuelconsumption by 3% 
 Effect substantially less at high load

          <text>Heat Transfer Summary 
1. Magnitude of heat transfer from the burned gas much greater than in 
any phase of cycle 
2. Heat transfer is a significant performance loss and affects engine 
operation 
Loss of available energy 
Volumetric efficiency loss 
Effect on knock in SI engine 
Effect on mixture preparation in SI engine cold start 
Effect on diesel engine cold start 
3. Convective heat transfer depends on gas temperature, heat transfer 
coefficient, which depends on charge motion, and transfer area, 
which depends on flame/combustion chamber geometry 
4. Radiative heat transfer is smaller than convective one, and it is only 
significant in diesel engines

Fuel-air cycle results 
In the Fuel-Air Cycle, the engine processes are still modeled as ideal 
but the properties of the working fl uid (fuel/air/residual gas mixture 
before combustion, and burned gases in chemical equilibrium after 
combustion) are described accurately. 
The results from this improved cy cle analysis model are useful for 
estimating, approximately, the effect s of compression ratio, fuel/air 
equivalence ratio, and mixture inlet conditions on engine efficiency and 
performance. The following approxim ate relationships are useful. 
1. The maximum indicated fuel conver sion efficiency of an actual engine is 
about 0.85 times the efficiency of the equivalent fuel-air cycle. 
2. Results from change of engine operating condition can be interpreted in 
terms of percentage c hange in output values 
Computer codes which accurately simulate the real engine cycle have 
now been developed and are widely used.

          <text>Super- and Turbo- Charging 
Purpose: To increas e the charge density 
 Supercharge: compressor powered by engine output 
 No turbo-lag 
 Does not impact exhaust treatment 
 Less efficient than turbo-charging 
 Turbo-charge: compressor powered by exhaust turbine 
 More directly utilize exhaust energy 
 Turbo- lag problem 
 Affects exhaust treatment 
 Intercooler 
 Increase charge density (hence output power) by cooling the 
charge 
 Lowers NOx emissions 
 Suppresses knock 
Additional benefit of turbo-charging 
 Can downsize engine while retaining same 
max power 
 Less throttle loss under part load in SI engine 
 Higher BMEP reduces relative friction and heat transfer losses

          <text>FUEL FACTORS 
 The auto-ignition process depends on the fuel
chemistry. 
 Practical fuels are blends of a large numberof individual hydrocarbon compounds, eachof which has its own chemical behavior. 
 A practical measure of a fuels resistance to
knock is the octane number. High octanenumber fuels are more resistant to knock.

          <text>Ignition and Flame Development Process 
1. Spark discharge creates a high temperature plasma kernel 
which expands rapidly (1mm, 100 s). 
2. The hot reactive gas at the outer edge of this kernel causes the 
adjacent fuel-air mixture to ignite, creating an outward 
propagating flame which is almost spherical. 
3. As the flame grows larger, the fl ame surface is distorted by the 
turbulence of the fluid motion. A wrinkled laminar flame results. 
4. Because of the significant surface area enhancement by the 
wrinkling, the locally laminar turbulent flame burns rapidly.

SI Engine Knock 
1. Knock is most critical at WOT and at low speed because of its 
persistence and potential for damage. Part-throttle knock is a 
transient phenomenon and is a nuisance to the driver. 
2. Whether or not knock occurs depends on engine/fuel/vehicle factors and ambient conditions (temperature, humidity). This 
makes it a complex phenomenon. 
3. To avoid knock with gasoline, the engine compression ratio is limited to approximately 12.5 in PFI engines and 13.5 in DISI
engines. Significant efficiency gains are possible if the compression ratio could be rais ed. (Approximately, increasing 
CR by 1 increases efficiency by one percentage point.) 
4. Feedback control of spark timing using a knock sensor is used so that SI engine can operate close to its knock limit.

Knock Fundamentals 
Knock originates in the extremely rapid release of much of the fuel 
chemical energy contained in the end-gas of the propagating 
turbulent flame, resulting in high local pressures. The non-
uniform pressure distribution causes strong pressure waves or 
shock waves to propagate across and excites the acoustic modes 
of the combustion chamber. 
When the fuel-air mixture in the end-gas region is compressed to 
sufficiently high pressures and temperatures , the fuel oxidation 
process  starting with the pre-flame chemistry and ending with 
rapid heat release  can occur spontaneously in parts or all of the 
end-gas region. 
Most evidence indicates that knock originates with the auto -
ignition of one or more local regions within the end-gas. Additional regions then ignite until the end-gas is essentially fully reacted. The sequence of processes occur extremely rapidly.

Factors affecting fuel  conversion efficiency 
These ideal engine cycle analysis  results show that expansion 
ratio rc and gas composition (through  the ratio of specific 
heats) both affect the cycles fu el conversion efficiency because: 
1. The expansion ratio (which may or may not equal to the compression ratio) determines how much work is extracted over the expansion stroke. 
2. The higher the value of  the more the temperature falls 
during expansion, the larger the energy change and hence the larger the expansion stroke work. 
3. The compression stroke work is of order one-sixth of the 
expansion stroke work so expansion stroke work effects dominate.

The Hydrogen problem: 
Fundamentally H2 is the only feasible fuel in the 
foreseeable future 
 Strictly, hydrogen is not a fuel, but an energy 
storage medium 
 Difficulty in hydrogen storage 
 Difficulty in hydrogen supply infra structure 
 Hydrogen from fossil fuel is not an efficient 
energy option

Note: HC to H2/CO process is exothermic; 
energy loss ~20% and needs to cool stream 
(Methanol reforming process  is energy neutral, but 
energy loss is similar when i t is made from fossil fuel) 
Current best reformer efficiency is ~70% 
Problems:

 Reaction of nitrogen and oxygen in the high temperature burned 
gas regions 
 Particulate matter (PM) emission (most significant in diesel engines; 
there are significant PM emissions in SI engines in terms of number density, especially in direct injection engines) 
 Particulates formed by pyrolysis of fuel molecules in the locally fuel 
rich region and incomplete oxidation of these particles 
 Lubrication oil contribution

 PM very small by mass 
CO Emissions Mechanism 
 CO is the incomplete oxidation product of the fuel carbon 
 Significant amount in fuel rich condition 
 Immediately following combustion, CO is in chemical equilibrium with the burned gas 
 During expansion, as the burned gas temperature decreases, CO is frozen

          <text>Optimum Combustion Phasing 
 Heat release schedule has to phase correctly with piston motion for
optimal work extraction 
 In SI engines, combustion phasing controlled by spark 
 Spark too late 
 heat release occurs far into expansion and work cannot be fully
extracted 
 Spark too early 
 Effectively lowers compression ratio 
 increased heat transfer losses 
 Also likely to cause knock 
 Optimal: Maximum Brake Torque (MBT) timing 
 MBT spark timing depends on speed, load, EGR, , temperature, 
charge motion,  
 Torque curve relatively flat: roughly 5 to 7oCA retard from MBT 
results in 1% loss in torque

Burn duration 
 Burn duration as CA-deg. : measure of burn progress
in cycle 
 For modern fast-burn engines under medium speed,
part load condition: 
 0-10% ~ 15o 
 0-50% ~ 25o 
 0-90% ~ 35o 
 As engine speed increases,
burn duration as CA-deg. : 
 Increases because there is less time per CA-deg. 
 Decreases because combustion is faster due to higher turbulence 
Net effect: increases approximately as rpm0.2

1. Pressure is uniform, changing with time 
2. For mass m: hb = hu (because dm is allowed to expand against prevailing pressure) 
3. T rise is a function of fuel heating value and mixture composition 
 e.g. at  = 1, Tu ~ 700 K, Tb ~ 2800 K 
4. Hence burned gas expands: b~  u; Vb ~ 4 Vu

Combustion produced pressure rise 
5. Since total volume is constrained. The pressure must rise by p, and all the 
gas in the cylinder is compressed. 
6. Both the unburned gas ahead of flam e and burned gas behind the flame move 
away from the flame front 
7. Both the unburned gas and burned gas temperatures rise due to the 
compression by the newly burned gas 
8. Unburned gas state: since heat transfer is relatively small, the temperature is

          <text>process via introducing fuel late in the cycle; compression 
ignition 
 Concept developed by the company MAN 
 Diesel was in heavy debt, and jumped off a ship. 
1870s Development of the Petroleum 
Industry 
1900s Spark plug dominated the market of 
ignition devices Spark plug was invented by Edmond Berger in 1839. Albert 
Champion was the most successful manufacturer. 
1920s ICE dominated the market of 
automotive power plant Main reason for not using the steam engine for vehicles was that 
too much water was needed. 
1920s Tetra-ethyl lead as anti-knock agent Thomas Midgl ey, under the direction of Carles Kettering at GM 
found the compound to suppress knock after extensive search.  With leaded gasoline, maximu m compression ratio was raised 
from 5 to 9, and engine effi ciency increased substantially 
1920-1960 Steady development 
1960s Vehicle emissions became an issue Smog mechanism was discovered by Haagen Smit 
1970s Oil embargo; energy crisis 
1980s Start of global competition 
1980s Catalytic converter and unleaded 
gasoline The 3 way catalyst reduced emissions of CO, HC and NOx by more than an order of magnitude, and was the enabler for the vehicles to meet emissions regulations 
1990s  Recognition of importance of green 
house gas 
2000s Towards sustainable transportation 
Gas exchange process of 4- and 2-stroke engines 
See figures 1-2 and 1-3. 
 2-stroke engine theoretically has twice the power density of 2-stroke engine; in practice, the ratio is about 1.4 
(value larger for low speed turbo-charger engi nes) because of incompleteness of scavenging. 
 For effective scavenging of the 2-stroke, there will be excess air in the exhaust, and the 3-way catalyst would 
not work.  Therefore 2-stroke SI engine would not be able to meet the stringent emission regulations 
Engine pressure traces 
See Fig. 1.8 and 1.15 for SI and Compression Ignition engines 
 Pressure measurement is an important diagnostic because it is directly related to the mechanical energy output 
of the engine (Torque = P dV/d , where  is the crank angle); furthermore, interpretation of pressure is 
unambiguous since it is uniform in the cylinder (e xcept in knocking), whereas temperature is not. 
 Empirically for most efficient operation, peak pressure for SI engine is at 14-17
o CA-ATC; for diesel is at 7-10o 
CA-ATC. 
 The very rapid pressure rise in the beginning of  diesel combustion is the cause of the diesel noise.

Lecture 1: Introduction to ICE 
Vocabulary
Engine : Device to convert fuel energy to mechanical energy 
 Fuel energy to thermal energy by combustion 
 Thermal energy to mechanical energy by expansion 
Internal combustion: combustion takes place in working fluid 
External combustion: combustion occurs externally; energy  coupled to working fluid by heat transfer device 
Open cycle: working fluid discharged to atmosphere; e.g. all ICE Close cycle: working fluid recycled through engine; e.g. steam engine with condenser 
ICE 
Size: displacement volume 1cc to 1m
3 per cylinder; comment on why it is difficult to build engine outside this 
range. 
Power: 10 W to 108 W per cylinder 
Applications: Automotive, marine, pow er generation, mechanical devices 
Classification: 
 by application: Car, Truck, Marine, Rail, Stationary generation,  
 by basic engine design: reciprocating, rotary, in-line block, V-block, radial, oppose piston, pre-/open chamber 
 by working cycle: 2-stroke, 4-stroke, naturally aspir ated , turbo-charged, super-charged, turbo-compound 
 by fuel: gasoline, diesel, alcohol, natural gas,  
 by mixture preparation: carbureted, fuel injection 
 by ignition: spark ignited, compression ignited 
History 
Circa Event People and key concept 
1860 Rudimentary ICE Jean J. Lenoir. 
 Key concept: Combustion increases temperature and gas 
expands. Expanding gas drives piston to produce mechanical energy. 
 Modified steam energy; no compression 
 Operated at 10 cycles/min; efficiency &lt;5% because of low effective compression ratio 
Sold 500 of them 
1867 Atmospheric free piston engine Nicolaus Otto and Eugene Langen 
 Key concept: still no compression, but use the inertia of a 
heavy piston to over-expand the combustion gas to below 
atmosphere, thereby increasing the expansion ratio.  Output mechanical work stored as gravitational potential energy in heavy piston first, and then extracted by clutching piston to fly wheel on downward stroke. 
 Larger expansion ratio: efficiency increased to 11% 
 Operate at 28 cycles/minute 
 Used a flame ignitor through a sliding window 
Sold 5000, dominated market for 10 years until introduction of the 4-stroke engine 
1876 4-stroke engine Nicolaus Otto 
1878 2-stroke engine Dougald Clerk 
1892 Compression Ignition 4-stroke Rudolf Diesel 
 Key concepts: prevent the very rapid and high pressure heat

DIESEL FUEL INJECTION 
The fuel spray serves multiple purposes: 
 Atomization 
 Fuel distribution 
 Fuel/air mixing 
Typical Diesel fuel injector 
 Injection pressure: 1000 to 2200 bar 
 5 to 20 holes at ~ 0.12 - 0.2 mm diameter 
 Drop size 0.1 to 10 m 
 For best torque, injection starts at about 20o BTDC

          <text>Ignition Delay Calculations 
 

 Difficulty: do not know local c onditions (species concentration 
and temperature) to apply kinetics information 
 Two practical approaches: 
 Use an instantaneous delay expression 
(T,P) = P-nexp(-EA/ T) 
 and solve ignition delay ( id) from 
11 tsiid dtt (T(),P()) si tt
  Use empirical correlation of id based on T, P at an appropriate 
charge condition; e.g. Eq. (10.37 of text) 
1 1 21.2 0.63 

id(CA) (0.36 0.22Sp(m/ s))exp EA(~ ) ( )
RT(K) 17190) P(bar) 12.4 
EA (Joules per mole) = 618,840 / (CN+25)  
 

Diesel Engine Combustion 
Air Fuel Mixing Process 
 Importance of air utilization 
 Smoke-limit A/F ~ 20 
 Fuel jet momentum / wall interaction has a larger influence 
on the early part of the combustion process 
 Charge motion impacts the later part of the combustion process (after end-of-injection) 
CHARGE MOTION CONTROL 
 Intake created motion: swirl, etc. 
 Not effective for low speed large engine

PROCESS 
 Liquid fuel injected into compressed charge 
 Fuel evaporates and mixes with the hot air 
 Auto-ignition with the rapid burning of the fuel-
air that is premixed during the ignition delay period 
 Premixed burning is fuel rich 
 As more fuel is injected, the combustion is controlled by the rate of diffusion of air into the flame

          <text>Diesel as the Most Efficient Power Plant 
 Theoretically, for the same CR, SI engine has higher f; but 
diesel is not limited by knock, therefore it can operate at 
higher CR and achieves higher f 
 Not throttled - small pumping loss 
 Overall lean - higher value of  - higher thermodynamic 
efficiency 
 Can operate at low rpm - applicable to very large engines 
 slow speed, plenty of time for combustion 
 small surface to volume ratio: lower percentage of parasitic losses (heat transfer and friction) 
 Opted for turbo-charging: higher energy density 
 Reduced parasitic losses (friction and heat transfer) relative to output 
Large Diesels: f~ 55% 
~ 98% ideal efficiency ! 
Diesel Engine Characteristics 
(compared to SI engines) 
 Better fuel economy 
 Overall lean, thermodynamically efficient 
 Large displacement, low speed  lower FMEP 
 Higher CR 
&gt; CR limited by peak pressure, NOx emissions, combustion and 
heat transfer loss 
 Turbo-charging not limited by knock: higher BMEP over domain of 
operation, lower relative losses (friction and heat transfer) 
 Lower Power density 
 Overall lean: would lead to smaller BMEP 
 Turbocharged: would lead to higher BMEP 
&gt; not knock limited, but NOx limited 
&gt; BMEP higher than natura lly aspirated SI engine 
 Lower speed: overall power density (P/VD) not as high as SI engines 
 Emissions: more problematic than SI engine 
 NOx: needs development of efficient catalyst 
 PM: regenerative and continuous traps

FEATURES OF DIESEL COMBUSTION 
 Ignition delay 
 Auto-ignition in different parts of combustion chamber 
 After ignition, fuel sprays into hot burned gas 
 Then, evaporation process is fast 
 Major part of combustion controlled by fuel air mixing process 
 Mixing dominated by flow field formed by fuel jet interacting with 
combustion chamber walls during injection 
 Highly luminous flame: 
 Substantial soot formation in the f uel rich zone by pyrolysis, followed 
by substantial subsequent oxidation

 Viscosity is a strong function of temperature 
 Multi-grade oils (introduced in the 1950s) 
 Temperature sensitive polymers to stabilize 
viscosity at high temperatures 
Cold: polymers coiled and inactive 
Hot: polymers uncoiled and tangle-up: 
suppress high temperature thinning 
 Stress sensitivity: viscosity is a function of 
strain rate 
Viscosity 
10W30 refers to upper viscosity limit equal to single grade SAE 10 at 0 deg F (-18C) 
and lower viscosity limit equal to SAE single grade 30 at 100 C.
