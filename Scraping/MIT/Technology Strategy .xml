Projects
 Pick a domain, and within that domain a business , and 
recommend what the business strategy should now be
 Move from individual assignments which are 
descriptive, to demonstrating the ability to synthesize 
your understanding and be prescriptive , outline what a 
specific management team should be 
 You should be thinking about this from the perspective 
of the management team of the business that you have 
chosen, imagine yourselves as that group 
 It may be helpful to assign specific roles, focused on 
technology and innovation, on the demand opportunity, 
on the business ecosystem and on capturing value</text>

An Architectural Principle 
 Economic Benefits and risk reduction for large 
engineering systems can be shown by designing for 
staged deployment, rather then for worst case, fixed 
capacity. 
 Embedding such flexibility does not come for free and 
evolution paths of system designs do not generally 
coincide with the Pareto frontier.

Building the team 
 Assemble a heterogeneous team, including diverse ages, 
genders, specialist expertise and professional experience 
 Meet together as a team often and regularly 
 Encourage team members to assume roles that go 
beyond their nominal responsibilities of product, market 
or function 
 Apply multiple mindsets to any issue, using tools such 
as scenarios, role-playing and war games 
 Actively manage conflict  but dont make it personal, 
or seek to suppress it

Three key facets: deadline-driven optimization; 
set-based development; rapid low-cost iterations 
1	The team defines a set of solutions at 
the system level, rather than a single 
solution 
2	It defines sets of possible solutions for 
various sub-systems 
3	It explores these possible sub-systems 
in parallel, using analysis, design rules 
and experiments to characterize a set of 
possible solutions 
4	It uses the analysis to gradually narrow 
the set of solutions, converging slowly 
towards a single solution 
5	Once the team establishes the single 
solution for any part of the design, it 
does not change it unless absolutely

Staged Deployment 
 The traditional approach doesnt reduce risks because it 
cannot adapt to uncertainty 
 A flexible approach can be used: the system should 
have the ability to adapt to the uncertain demand 
 This can be achieved with a staged deployment strategy: 
A smaller, more affordable system is initially built 
This system has the flexibility to increase its 
capacity if demand is sufficient and if the decision 
makers can afford additional capacity

          <slideno>22</slideno>
          <text>15.965  Technology &amp; Strategy
Staged deployment strategy reduces the 
economic risks via two mechanisms 
 The costs of the system are spread through time: 
Money has a time value: to spend a dollar tomorrow 
is better than spending one now (Present Value) 
Delaying expenditures always appears as an 
advantage
 The decision to deploy is done observing the market 
conditions: 
Demand may never grow and we may want to keep 
the system as it is without deploying further. 
If demand is important enough, we may have made 
sufficient profits to invest in the next stage.

For high-tech businesses, fast decision-making 
is critical to success 
 Fast decision making 
allows decision 
makers to keep pace 
with change and is 
linked to strong 
performance
 Fast decision makers 
use more, not less, 
information
 Fast decision makers 
develop more, not 
fewer, parallel
alternatives

Resolution without consensus 
 Multi-step process 
 Beforehand, identify skateholders and experts 
 Explicitly agree how the rules for resolution: 
expertise  who has the best information 
experience  who has encountered this challenge 
effects  who are the stakeholders, most affected 
executive power  who is most senior 
 Seek consensus 
 If you cant reach it, defer to the agreed decision-makers

Modularity is becoming more prevalent, increasing 
value creation , challenging value capture 
 Falling costs of co-ordination make modularity easier 
 Modularity, where it can be employed effectively, can 
accelerate value creation 
once dominant design established, hence stable 
architecture and modular interfaces 
and ultimate performance is not critical 
autonomous or modular innovations, in this context

Microsofts take on Linux 
 OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat  to 
Microsoft, particularly in server space 
 the intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits 
that are not replicable  with our current licensing model and 
therefore present a long term developer mindshare threat . 
 commercial quality  can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects 
 OSS is long-term credible FUD tactics can not... combat it . 
 Linux outperforms many other UNIXes 
 Linux can win as long as services / protocols are commodities. 
 OSS projects have been able to gain a foothold in many server 
applications because of the wide utility of highly commoditized, 
simple protocols. By extending these protocols and developing 
new protocols, we can deny OSS projects entry into the market. 
 OSS evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster 
than our own evangelization efforts appear to scale

General Public License  GPL

Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD Unix) Apache Software License (ASL) Characteristics/.notdef.g0001 
Copyleft   most open; prohibits proprietary 
forks, strongly driving openness
If you add code, and distribute software, you must 
grant unaltered GPL  to combined program - Linux 
Kernel uses this (GPLv2)
Allows proprietary extensions or distributions
Code issued with this license can be included on

(Potentially) disruptive technologies  must have
 two key characteristics 
 Products and services
 that embody these
 technologies in their
 early stages have 
attributes that make
 them unattractive to
 incumbents current
 mainstream
 customers , and
 typically appeal only to
 small and emerging
 markets or segments,
 and offer inferior
 returns  These technologies have
 the potential for rapid
 innovation  along
 trajectories that will in
 future enable products
 or services that will
 then become attractive
 to incumbents
 mainstream  customers,
 allowing insurgents to
 later invade established
 markets and displace
 the incumbent

Even when incumbents anticipate disruption and
 respond, cognitive limitations may doom them 
 Polaroid was the leader in instant photography 
 23% pa sales, 17% profit growth late 40s to late 70s 
 A technology-driven company 
 belief that long-term, large-scale research enables great
 products, great products create their own market 
 endogeneous demand, little need for or value in
 conventional market research

Whats the difference between conventional 
inquiry and empathic observation? 
Inquiry Observation 
People can t ask for what they don t know Well-chosen observers know what s technically possible 
People are generally highly unreliable reporters 
of their own behavior Observers rely on real actions rather than reported behavior 
People tend to give answers they think are 
expected or desired Observers can use nonverbal cues of feelings and responses through 
body language, in addition to spontaneous, unsolicited comments 
People are less likely to recall their feelings about intangible 
characteristics of products and services when they aren t in the 
process of using them Using the actual product or a prototype, or engaging in the actual 
activity , stimulates comments about intangibles associated with the 
product s use 
People s imaginations  and hence desires 
 are bounded by experience; they accept inadequacies and 
deficiencies as normal Trained, technically sophisticated observers 
can see solutions to unarticulated needs 
Questions are often biased and reflect inquirers 
unrecognized assumptions Observation is open ended and varied; trained 
observers cancel outbiases 
Questioning interrupts the usual flow of people s 
natural activity Observation interrupts normal activities less than 
questioning does 
Questioning stifles opportunities for users to suggest innovations Observers in the field can identify user innovations 
that can be duplicated and improved for the rest of the market

Users needs are diverse, they change over time, 
and users respond to technological innovation 
 Heterogeneous - potential 
customers or users have a range 
of different needs (jobs they 
want done) and values that they 
put on getting those jobs done 
 may be related to 
demographic
characteristics
 but not necessarily, so in 
many cases other bases of 
segmentation may be more 
useful 
 psychographic 
segmentations often useful  Exogenous - what users and 
customers want changes over 
time in response to, amongst 
other things, their own 
changing circumstances and 
broad societal shifts 
 Endogenous - users and 
customers beliefs and 
behavior also change in 
response to technological 
innovation  information about 
new possibilities

Unfortunately, you cant figure out what the 
demand opportunity is by asking customers 
 customers can say what they want if they are asked 
to make selections within a familiar product category 
 But when customers are asked to make new product 
recommendations or to venture into territory about 
which they have limited or no knowledge, theyrun 
intoblocks 
 functional fixedness  the human tendency to 
fixate on the way products or services are normally 
used, making people unable to imagine alternative 
functions 
people may not be able to conceive of a solution 
because they have apparently contradictory needs

Everett Rogers identified five product-based 
factors that governed the rate of diffusion 
 Relative advantage  - the degree to which a product is 
better than the product that it replaces 
 Compatibility - degree to which product is consistent 
with users context, in particular values and experiences 
 Complexity - degree to which a product is difficult to 
understand and use 
 Trialability - the degree to which a product may be 
experimented with on a limited basis 
 Observability - the degree to which product usage and 
impact are visible to others

One widely used model for the diffusion of 
innovations is the Bass model 
S(t) = 
[p + (q/m)N(t-1) ]
[m  N(t-1) ]
S(t): customers adopting
during time period t
N(t): customers who have adopted
through time period t
N(t-1) : customers who have adopted
through time period t-1
m: total market size 
p: coefficient of innovation,
probability that an innovator will adopt at time t
q: coefficient of imitation,
accounts for diffusion of information

Technologies compete with each other for 
potential applications 
 At any time, there are typically a range of competing 
technologies that can be used for any given application 
 Each of these technologies can be characterized in terms 
of its key parameters 
 Each technology has some inherent trade-offs  amongst 
these key parameters, and at any time it has certain 
performance limits, its performance envelope 
 Over time, technologies improve in performance 
as a result of innovation and investment and learning 
along an innovation trajectory , a vector describing 
how they have evolved and will likely evolve

Its not easy to get customers to adopt novel 
products that embody technological innovation 
 Most customers, most of the time are loath to change 
their behavior 
requires investment of time and effort 
involves uncertainty, induces anxiety 
 Customers are (necessarily) unfamiliar with novel 
products and their potential benefits 
 Novel products almost always involve trade-offs 
 They evaluate products based on perceived  value, 
relative to products they already use to do a job, and are 
overly sensitive to dis-benefits - loss aversion 
 At the same time, businesses (full of technologists) tend 
to underestimate the switching costs, and overestimate 
the potential benefits

But the V-22 Osprey has a particular challenge at 
high rates of descent 
The.. configuration of the 
V-22 is susceptible to 
asymmetric onset of Vortex 
Ring State (VRS), brought 
on by descending too 
quickly. The one-rotor-in/ 
one-rotor-out conditions 
results in large rolling 
moments and departure 
from controlled flight . Such 
a characteristic is 
fundamental and cannot be 
remedied by minor design 
changes. The only near-term 
solution is to restrict 
operations to avoid proximity 
to VRS region.

work with lead users 
 For very novel products 
or in product categories 
in which change is rapid, 
most potential users will 
not have the experience

 Lead users  however 
have present strong needs

The first step in developing strategy for any 
high-tech business is anticipation 
 What will happen next? 
how will technologies evolve, what will be their 
innovation trajectory? 
how will technological innovations diffuse amongst 
target customers and become adopted? 
what demand opportunities does this create that can 
be met by products that embody novel technologies?

Over time, however, successful innovations 
diffuse amongst users and get widely adopted 
 Probit adoption 
potential users or customers weigh costs and benefits 
heterogeneity of preferences means that different 
users or customers adopt at different times 
 Epidemic adoption 
adoption limited by availability of information 
as potential users and customers become aware of 
what it does and how to use it, they will adopt 
 Information cascades  and path dependence 
a technology becomes established, it works and is 
better, and its features well known, legitimizing it 
once established, network effects take over

 What are the key parameters that characterize it, what are 
the key trade-offs  and the performance envelope ? 
 How have the key parameters evolved over time, what has 
been the innovation trajectory  for this technology? 
 What are the key alternative technologies  with which it 
competes for potential applications , and what are their 
advantages and disadvantages? 
 How do you anticipate the key technologies in this

Technologies compete with each other for 
potential applications 
 At any time, there are typically a range of competing 
technologies that are candidates for each application 
 Each of these technologies can be characterized in terms 
of its key parameters 
 Each technology typically has a performance envelope,
which defines the trade-offs inherent in the technology 
 Over time, technologies follow an innovation trajectory , 
a vector or function that describes how they have 
evolved and may evolve, either over time or in response 
to effort invested in their development

 As of 09:00:00  an 8% discount, scaling the mark for

 Thereafter an additional 4% per hour that the paper is 
late, so that a paper that is just over an hour late will be

Iridium was technically successful, but a 
commercial disaster  what can we learn from it? 
1.	Who is responsible for Iridiums failure? 
2.	At what point could you have predicted out that there 
was a significant risk that Iridium would fail? 
3.	What is your assessment of Iridiums overall system 
design? 
4.	What impact did the choices that were made have on 
the subsequent economics of the venture? 
5.	What impact did Iridiums organization design have 
on the outcome, and in particular who were the key 
stakeholders and what was their motivations? 
6.	What alternative technical or commercial strategies 
could or should Iridium have pursued?</text>

Closing thoughts 
 Big Bang projects usually blow up 
 For most opportunities from technology-driven settings: 
not enough customers who care enough 
 Most complex projects in an uncertain environment 
can be broken down into a series of smaller 
experiments, the value of which will exceed their cost.</text>

line and announced a new set of MP3 players in 2004. 
 The market is then been flooded with new entrants 
including SanDisk, Sony, Rio, Creative, iRiver, 
Samsung and others

Lexar Media: what happened next 
	It does not develop high-speed 
MMC card, nor its own digital 
film format 
	In 2001 Lexar spins off 
Printroom.com and discontinues 
Shoot n Share, SayCheeze.com 
	In 2002  Lexar removes digital 
film from its packaging 
	In July 2002 Lexar ships its first 
USB Flash Drive 
	In 4Q 2003 Lexar ships its first 
MP3 Player 
	By 2004, Lexar had achieved 
distribution at over 56,000 
storefronts 	In March 2005, Lexar won a trade 
secret suit against Toshiba, which 
was ordered to pay Lexar $465 
million (Toshiba challenged the 
verdict) 
	In July, 2006 Micron acquired 
Lexar for about $850 million 
($9.50/share) 
	In September 2006 Toshiba 
agreed to pay $288M to settle its 
IP dispute with Micron (Lexar)</text>

Insights from Lexar Media 
 Initially a strong link from its technological competence 
to relevant attributes of system performance for 
customers willing to pay 
click to click speed 
proprietary technology in a bottleneck 
 Rather than licensing, entry into digital film builds a 
public company of significant size 
value capture through complement 
 Lexar is focused, offering a differentiated product, but 
basis for differentiation in USB flash drives not clear 
 Competition has very different scope

Flash card market 
 By the end of 2003, vertically-integrated SanDisk had negated 
much of Lexars speed advantage through innovations in the cards 
flash component. 
 In 2004, Lexar announced an exclusive agreement with Kodak to 
manufacture and sell Kodak-branded digital film 
 In 2004, Lexar announced its Active Memory System aimed at 
improving professional photographer workflow 
 Industry prices decreased faster than anticipated in 01

Response to transition  whether your survive or
 thrive  ultimately depends on four key factors 
Demand opportunity  -
who your customers are and
 what they want
Business model and
business ecosystem  -
your chosen niche and target
 customers, its business model
 and hence how you make
 money
Technological infrastructure
 and innovation   
explicit and tacit component
 and architectural knowledge
Your mental models
 -beliefs about the
 future, about how to
 make money ,
 reflected in your
 communication
 channels,
 information filters
 and search and

 Polaroid was the leader in instant photography 
 23% pa sales, 17% profit growth late 40s to late 70s 
 A technology-driven company 
 belief that long-term, large-scale research enables great
 products, great products create their own market 
 endogeneous demand, little need for or value in
 conventional market research 
 Believed in consumables 
 Whats the business model? Its the razor/blade  so
 we make money with the film 
  in the photographic business, all the money is in the
 software [film], none of it is in the hardware
