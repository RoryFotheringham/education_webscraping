Staged deployment strategy reduces the 
economic risks via two mechanisms 
&#8226;&#65533; The costs of the system are spread through time: 
&#8211;&#65533;Money has a time value: to spend a dollar tomorrow 
is better than spending one now (Present Value) 
&#8211;&#65533;Delaying expenditures always appears as an 
advantage
&#8226;&#65533; The decision to deploy is done observing the market 
conditions: 
&#8211;&#65533;Demand may never grow and we may want to keep 
the system as it is without deploying further. 
&#8211;&#65533;If demand is important enough, we may have made 
sufficient profits to invest in the next stage.

Staged Deployment 
&#8226;&#65533; The traditional approach doesn&#8217;t reduce risks because it 
cannot adapt to uncertainty 
&#8226;&#65533; A flexible approach can be used: the system should 
have the ability to adapt to the uncertain demand 
&#8226;&#65533; This can be achieved with a staged deployment strategy: 
&#8211;&#65533;A smaller, more affordable system is initially built 
&#8211;&#65533;This system has the flexibility to increase its 
capacity if demand is sufficient and if the decision 
makers can afford additional capacity

&#8226;&#65533; Economic Benefits and risk reduction for large 
engineering systems can be shown by designing for

Technologies compete with each other for 
potential applications 
&#8226;&#65533; At any time, there are typically a range of competing 
technologies that are candidates for each application 
&#8226;&#65533; Each of these technologies can be characterized in terms 
of its key parameters 
&#8226;&#65533; Each technology typically has a performance envelope,
which defines the trade-offs inherent in the technology 
&#8226;&#65533; Over time, technologies follow an innovation trajectory , 
a vector or function that describes how they have 
evolved and may evolve, either over time or in response 
to effort invested in their development

1.&#65533;	Who is responsible for Iridium&#8217;s failure? 
2.&#65533;	At what point could you have predicted out that there 
was a significant risk that Iridium would fail? 
3.&#65533;	What is your assessment of Iridium&#8217;s overall system 
design? 
4.&#65533;	What impact did the choices that were made have on 
the subsequent economics of the venture? 
5.&#65533;	What impact did Iridium&#8217;s organization design have 
on the outcome, and in particular who were the key 
stakeholders and what was their motivations? 
6.&#65533;	What alternative technical or commercial strategies 
could or should Iridium have pursued?

(Potentially) disruptive technologies  must have
 two key characteristics 
&#8226;&#65533; Products and services
 that embody these
 technologies in their
 early stages have 
attributes that make
 them unattractive to
 incumbents&#8217; current
 mainstream
 customers , and
 typically appeal only to
 small and emerging
 markets or segments,
 and offer inferior
 returns &#8226;&#65533; These technologies have
 the potential for rapid
 innovation  along
 trajectories that will in
 future enable products
 or services that will
 then become attractive
 to incumbents&#8217;
 mainstream  customers,
 allowing insurgents to
 later invade established
 markets and displace
 the incumbent

Lexar Media: what happened next 
&#8226;	It does not develop high-speed 
MMC card, nor its own &#8216;digital 
film&#8217; format 
&#8226;	In 2001 Lexar spins off 
Printroom.com and discontinues 
Shoot &#8216;n Share, SayCheeze.com 
&#8226;	In 2002 &#8211; Lexar removes &#8220;digital 
film&#8221; from its packaging 
&#8226;	In July 2002 Lexar ships its first 
USB Flash Drive 
&#8226;	In 4Q 2003 Lexar ships its first 
MP3 Player 
&#8226;	By 2004, Lexar had achieved 
distribution at over 56,000 
storefronts &#8226;	In March 2005, Lexar won a trade 
secret suit against Toshiba, which 
was ordered to pay Lexar $465 
million (Toshiba challenged the 
verdict) 
&#8226;	In July, 2006 Micron acquired 
Lexar for about $850 million 
($9.50/share) 
&#8226;	In September 2006 Toshiba 
agreed to pay $288M to settle its 
IP dispute with Micron (Lexar)

about $600M in 2003 
&#8226;&#65533; Lexar announced an entire line of flash drives, 
attempting to lead the market with value-added features. 
Touchguard, announced in December 2004, is a secure 
device that requires a fingerprint swipe to access 
protected data, such as passwords stored on the drive. 
&#8226;&#65533; In January 2005 SanDisk and M-Systems announced 
U3, a standard for the development of applications on a 
flash drive and are encouraging third parties to develop 
applications.

Technologies compete with each other for 
potential applications 
&#8226;&#65533; At any time, there are typically a range of competing 
technologies that can be used for any given application 
&#8226;&#65533; Each of these technologies can be characterized in terms 
of its key parameters 
&#8226;&#65533; Each technology has some inherent trade-offs  amongst 
these key parameters, and at any time it has certain 
performance limits, its performance envelope 
&#8226;&#65533; Over time, technologies improve in performance 
&#8211;&#65533;as a result of innovation and investment and learning 
&#8211;&#65533;along an innovation trajectory , a vector describing 
how they have evolved and will likely evolve

What&#8217;s the difference between conventional 
inquiry and empathic observation? 
Inquiry Observation 
People can&#8217; t ask for what they don&#8217; t know Well-chosen observers know what&#8217; s technically possible 
People are generally highly unreliable reporters 
of their own behavior Observers rely on real actions rather than reported behavior 
People tend to give answers they think are 
expected or desired Observers can use nonverbal cues of feelings and responses through 
body language, in addition to spontaneous, unsolicited comments 
People are less likely to recall their feelings about intangible 
characteristics of products and services when they aren&#8217; t in the 
process of using them Using the actual product or a prototype, or engaging in the actual 
activity , stimulates comments about intangibles associated with the 
product&#8217; s use 
People&#8217; s imaginations &#8211; and hence desires 
&#8211; are bounded by experience; they accept inadequacies and 
deficiencies as normal Trained, technically sophisticated observers 
can see solutions to unarticulated needs 
Questions are often biased and reflect inquirers&#8217; 
unrecognized assumptions Observation is open ended and varied; trained 
observers cancel outbiases 
Questioning interrupts the usual flow of people&#8217; s 
natural activity Observation interrupts normal activities less than 
questioning does 
Questioning stifles opportunities for users to suggest innovations Observers in the field can identify user innovations 
that can be duplicated and improved for the rest of the market

The process of empathic design typically 
involves five steps

&#8211;&#65533; who should be observed? 
&#8211;&#65533; who should do the observing?

But the V-22 Osprey has a particular challenge at 
high rates of descent 
The.. configuration of the 
V-22 is susceptible to 
asymmetric onset of Vortex 
Ring State (VRS), brought 
on by descending too 
quickly. The one-rotor-in/ 
one-rotor-out conditions 
results in large rolling 
moments and departure 
from controlled flight . Such 
a characteristic is 
fundamental and cannot be 
remedied by minor design 
changes. The only near-term 
solution is to restrict 
operations to avoid proximity 
to VRS region.

One way to develop breakthrough products is to 
work with &#8216;lead users&#8217; 
&#8226;&#65533; For very novel products 
or in product categories 
in which change is rapid, 
most potential users will 
not have the experience 
needed to solve problems 
or articulate their needs 
&#8226;&#65533; &#8216;Lead users&#8217;  however 
have present strong needs 
that will become general 
in a marketplace in the 
future

It&#8217;s not easy to get customers to adopt novel 
products that embody technological innovation 
&#8226;&#65533; Most customers, most of the time are loath to change 
their behavior 
&#8211;&#65533;requires investment of time and effort 
&#8211;&#65533;involves uncertainty, induces anxiety 
&#8226;&#65533; Customers are (necessarily) unfamiliar with novel 
products and their potential benefits 
&#8226;&#65533; Novel products almost always involve trade-offs 
&#8226;&#65533; They evaluate products based on perceived  value, 
relative to products they already use to do a job, and are 
overly sensitive to dis-benefits - &#8220;loss aversion&#8221; 
&#8226;&#65533; At the same time, businesses (full of technologists) tend 
to underestimate the switching costs, and overestimate 
the potential benefits

Users&#8217; needs are diverse, they change over time, 
and users respond to technological innovation 
&#8226;&#65533; Heterogeneous - potential 
customers or users have a range

want done) and values that they 
put on getting those jobs done 
&#8211;&#65533; may be related to 
demographic
characteristics
&#8211;&#65533; but not necessarily, so in 
many cases other bases of 
segmentation may be more 
useful

Everett Rogers identified five product-based 
factors that governed the rate of diffusion 
&#8226;&#65533; Relative advantage  - the degree to which a product is 
better than the product that it replaces 
&#8226;&#65533; Compatibility - degree to which product is consistent 
with users&#8217; context, in particular values and experiences 
&#8226;&#65533; Complexity - degree to which a product is difficult to 
understand and use 
&#8226;&#65533; Trialability - the degree to which a product may be 
experimented with on a limited basis 
&#8226;&#65533; Observability - the degree to which product usage and 
impact are visible to others

Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t figure out what the

&#8226;&#65533; &#8220;&#8230;customers can say what they want if they are asked 
to make selections within a familiar product category&#8221; 
&#8226;&#65533; &#8220;But when customers are asked to make new product 
recommendations or to venture into territory about 
which they have limited or no knowledge, they&#8230;run

Microsoft&#8217;s take on Linux 
&#8226;&#65533; OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat  to 
Microsoft, particularly in server space 
&#8226;&#65533; the intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits 
that are not replicable  with our current licensing model and 
therefore present a long term developer mindshare threat . 
&#8226;&#65533; &#8230;commercial quality  can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects 
&#8226;&#65533; OSS is long-term credible FUD tactics can not... combat it . 
&#8226;&#65533; Linux outperforms many other UNIXes 
&#8226;&#65533; Linux can win as long as services / protocols are commodities. 
&#8226;&#65533; OSS projects have been able to gain a foothold in many server 
applications because of the wide utility of highly commoditized, 
simple protocols. By extending these protocols and developing 
new protocols, we can deny OSS projects entry into the market. 
&#8226;&#65533; OSS evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster 
than our own evangelization efforts appear to scale
