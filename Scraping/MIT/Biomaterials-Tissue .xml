          <text>What does the scaffold do?
It blocks contraction and abolishes scar 
formation during wound healing. If used 
without cell seeding, it leads to 
regeneration of dermis.
Eventually, epidermal cells from wound 
edges regenerate over the new dermis, and synthesize basement menrane, to 
produce a new skin.

          <text>Does the scaffold act as a mechanical 
splint?
Assume a contractile force Fc= 0.1 N acts on a scaffold 
that has grafted a wound m easuring 10mm X 10mm in 
surface area with 1 mm depth. Acting on an area A = 10 
mm X 1 mm = 10 mm2 = 10-5m2, the force applies a 
compressive stress
c= Fc/A = 0.1N/ 10-5m2 = 104N/m2= 104Pa. 
At equilibrium the compressive stress applied by the cells 
hypothetically equals the splinting stress, s, with which 
the scaffold resists wound contraction. 
Hypothesize that the scaffold is a relatively stiff splint that has been deformed compressively by no more than 10%, 
or = 0.1. It must possess a Youngs modulus that is not 
less than E = 
s/= 104Pa/0.1 = 105Pa. However, measured 
values of E for scaffolds with pore volume fraction of 0.99 are only 10
2Pa. Such scaffolds are 1000X less stiff than 
required for mechanical splinting. The hypothesis that the 
scaffold works as a splint is rejected.</text>

          <text>Summarize evidence from healing in 
five adult organs
Back to the old question: Does scar 
block regeneration?
No. Wounds in most organs close spontaneously 
primarily by contraction.
Scar is the by-product of contraction. It is highly oriented stroma that is synthesized in the presence 
of the mechanical field that dominates wound 
contraction.
Regeneration requires blocking of contraction. When contraction is blocked by a scaffold, even partly, scar formation is cancelled.</text>

          <text>Question 1 . What is the best current mechanism 
of induced organ regeneration in adults using 
active scaffolds at the cell-biological and the 
molecular-biological levels? 
1.  Strong blocking of wound contraction, which 
leads to cancellation of scar formation. 
2.  Contraction blocking follows reduction of 
density of contractile cells and disorientation of 
their contractile axes. 
3. Phenotype changes hypothetically due to 
regulation following binding of contractile cells on specific ligands of insoluble surface of scaffold.</text>

          <text>Conclusions  from transcriptional analysis 
and proteomics analysis in poorly vs 
successfully regenerating models
TGFb1 and TGFb2, but not TGFb3, are 
expressed at significantly higher levels in the model of poor regeneration (relative to model 
of  successful regeneration). Same for the 
mRNA of these proteins.
-smooth muscle actin is expressed at much 
higher levels during poor regeneration 
(relative to successful regeneration). Same 
for the mRNA of this protein.
These results support the theory that 
contraction antagonizes regeneration.</text>

          <text>Mechanism of scaffold activity # 2. 
Scaffold disorients MFB thereby
reducing sum of forces generated by 
MFB
Fact: MFB bind avidly on scaffold surface with their 
long (contractile) axes quasi randomly oriented in 
space. Only a small fraction are oriented in the plane.
Fact: Bound MFB lose many connections with 
neighboring cells.
Lacking orientation in the plane of the wound, MFB lose most of their ability to pull wound edges in the plane and close the wound by contraction.
Fc= Nfi. According to this mechanism, the fraction of 
cells, , bound to the matrix and capable of applying 
traction, is reduced following grafting with an active scaffold. The macroscopic contractile force, F
c, is 
correspondingly reduced.</text>

presented with an ankle ulcer of several years duration. It 
was excised, including bone fragments and the arthrosis, and (a biologically active scaffold)  was used to close the

later, periwound inflammation is gone. The wound healed 
and has remained so, seen here a year later.

          <text>Question 2 : Is the process of induced 
regeneration of organ in adults similar to 
spontaneous regeneration at the early fetal
stage?
Partly, yes. Common features include: 
Downregulation of:  wound contraction, density and function of contractile cells, cytokine (TGF -
1) credited with induction of phenotype of contractile cells.  However, myofibroblasts 
present in adult but not in early fetal wounds. Role of TGF -2 unclear. Role of TGF -3 is under 
study.</text>

          <text>Hypothesis of loss of cell-cell 
cooperativity
 In the absence of an active scaffold, MFB 
are connected and oriented. They function 
cooperatively during wound contraction. 
The sum of forces exerted is higher than 
the sum of forces exerted by individual cells acting independently (noncooperatively).
 An active scaffold separates and 
disorients the MFB. It causes loss of cell-
cell cooperativity.</text>

          <text>Mechanism of scaffold activity # 1. 
Scaffold reduces the number of 
contractile cells 
Fact: In absence of scaffold, 50 % of fibroblasts in wound 
are MFB. In presence of scaffold only 10% are MFB. 
The structure of collagen fibers in active scaffolds has 
been modified by acid treatment to reduce significantly the 
% banded collagen fibers.
Loss of banding blocks thrombogenicity (platelet aggregation) of collagen fibers which in turn leads to 
TGFb1 depletion in wound.
TGFb1 depletion prevents MFB differentiation.
Fc= Nfi. .According to this mechanism, the number of 
MFB, N, goes down in the presence of the scaffold. The macroscopic contractile force, F
c, is correspondingly 
reduced.</text>

          <text>Directly assayed levels of ligand densi ty have been reported. In 
these studies the mass of l igand ad sorbed on the surface was di rectly 
assayed by a variety of methods i nvolving use of a characteri stic 
label or bi omarker for the ligand si te. The quantity of label was 
eventuall y assayed by a sui table detection method, whi ch was 
converted to the mass of l igand present  on the surface. In one study 
the mass of ligand (fibronectin) ad sorbed on the surface was assayed 
using ligand that had been spiked w ith a radi olabel (Valenick and 
Schwarzbauer, 2006; Maheshwari et al., 2000). In another study the 
mass of adsorbed collagen on glass plates was assayed by spiki ng 
with fluorescent collagen (Engler et  al., 2004). Other investigators 
assayed l igand density on surfaces w ith high-resolution magic-angle 
spinni ng NMR analysis using a novel internal standard (Lucas et al ., 
2004). A fluorescence resonance ene rgy transfer (FRE T) technique 
was used to quanti fy the number of bonds formed between cellul ar 
receptors and synthetic adhesion olig opepti des coupl ed to an artifi cial 
extracellular matri x (Kong et al., 2006). 
Advances in methodology have been based on incorporation of 
the highly useful and widely used fluorescent labels, followed by 
development of cali bration me thods to assay the mass of 
fluorescently-l abeled ligand on the surface (Model and  Healy, 2000). 
Quantitati ve assay of fluorescent l abeling was extended to 
measurement of the density of li gands on surface of peptide-modified 
biomateri als. In thi s protocol  spec ific proteolysi s was used to l iberate 
(elute) a labeled probe from an i mmobilized peptide, followed by 
assay of the liberated probe by high-throughput fl uorometry (Barber 
et al., 2005). Related development s led to assay of the fl uorophore 
directly on the surface (without prior elution) (Harbers et al., 
Langmuir, 2005). On the strength of this powerful methodology, i t 
became possi ble to demonstrate that osteoblast adhesi on strength on 
well-defined surfaces scaled with ligand density (Harbers and Healy, 
2005).

          <text>B7. Signi ficance of propos ed study.  
I. New methodology for quantitative design of biomateri als surfaces. 
Biomateri als scientists are becoming i ncreasingly adept at the desi gn 
of synthetic surfaces that modify cell phenotype. As a result, they now 
require two kinds of information. First, there i s need for increasi ngly 
quantitati ve information about the sp ecific surface features that 
induce phenotype modificati on, espec ially with cell-seeded surfaces. 
Second, since highly porous sca ffolds are increasingly being used, 
there is additional need for assays  that can describe the bound ligand 
density in 3D, i.e., the distributi on of bound li gands around the center 
of mass of the cell. 
The growing urgency for studying cells quantitatively in three-
dimensional structures i s illustrat ed in recent research l eading to 
synthesis of tissues and organs in vitro. Highly promising in vitro 
environments for synthesis of tiss ues and organs are expected to 
possess a well-defined 3D structure (J akab et al., 2008; Radisic et 
al., 2008; Park et al., 2007; Ti mmins et al., 2007). These 3D 
structures are recognized as a necess ary adjunct to the presence of 
cells, growth factors and an appropriat e bioreactor environment (Pei 
et al., 2008). 
The scaffolds that we propose to study are analogs of the ECM 
rather than syntheti c polymers. Analog s of this class are i n wide use 
today (see section immediately be low). They are often based on 
naturally occurring polymers, usua lly protei ns, such as collagen, 
elasti n and fibri n, with occasi onal parti cipation of proteogl ycans and 
glycosam inoglycans. The surfaces of these proteins provide a rich 
source of well-defi ned ligands for many important cell receptors, 
particularl y integrins. Cell-surfac e interaction in scaffolds is a 
demonstrably 3D phenomenon t hat can onl y be understood 
definitivel y by 3D i maging methodol ogy. We concl ude that scaffolds 
based on analogs of the ECM are an important class of biomateri als 
surfaces because they prov ide well-defined ligands i n 3D 
environments. 
The opportunity to base a new quanti tative methodology for 
surface characteri zation of ce ll-seeded 3D surfaces on these 
naturally occurring scaffolds cannot be missed. If thi s opportunity i s 
pursued successfully, t here will generation of new paradigms in 
methodology that will provide the basis for assays with other 
biomaterials as well. The new dat a that will em erge will be shaped</text>

          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>masking agent the highl y specific I-domain molecules (prepared as 
clones of a subunit for the 11 and 21 integrins). The I-domain 
molecules bind onl y to the li gand si tes on the collagen surface that 
are specific for the 11 integrin or the 21 integrin (the ligand sites 
are collagen oligopeptides with know n structure; see Methods). The 
masking reaction is a covalent crossli nking process,  leading to 
securely masked l igands, not affected by i onic strength or dil ution. 
The library will therefore be desig ned as a calibrated scale of D t 
values that gradually dec rease along the series.  
The density of bound ligands, D b, can then be estimated as the 
ligand density of the library me mber which shows minimal cell 
adhesi on, D c: 
Db  Dc (Eq. 2) 
In other words, D c is the ligand densi ty of the li brary member that is 
sufficientl y high to j ust secure adhe sion of cells onto its surface. The 
critical library mem ber will be ident ified as the D level (or short range 
of D values) al ong this calibrated scaffold series at which metrics 
related to adhesion change  significantl y compared to a scaffold with 
no ligand masking. These metrics include the cell aspect ratio, I (a 
metric for cell shape), average scaffo ld area occupied per cell , S, and 
density of bound cells, C, all of whic h will be assayed at each D level. 
The estimate will probably be a high value which can be refined at will 
by reduci ng the increments i n D along the series close to the critical 
masking range where cel l adhesion fai ls. 
This approach has similarities with the spinning disk method 
described in a p receding paragraph (Boetti ger, 2007; see above). 
However, unlike the spinning disk , the method described here is 
complemented with direct assayi ng of ligand density by two-photon 
microscopy at all l evels of the test sequence. 
B5. Need for a three-dimensional (3D) description of cell-scaffold 
interactions. Much of current methodology for surface 
characterization supports studies of cells on two-dimensi onal (2D) 
surfaces. There is, however, an inc reasing amount of  data showing 
clearl y that cell s express di fferent phenotypes on 3D compared to 2D 
surfaces. For exam ple (only a few cases are reported here for 
purpose of illustration), integrin expr ession profiles for two cell types 
have been shown to be di fferent wh en cultured on 3D substrates</text>

          <slideno>6</slideno>
          <text>number of cell s can then be processed to derive a descri ption for the 
average cell inside the scaffold. 
B6. Choi ce of microscop y method f or study  of cell-seeded 
surfaces of biomaterials. In the presence of cells it becomes 
necessary to use special ized mi croscopic methods for structural 
characterization of the cell-surf ace interacti on. A commonly used 
approach for studyi ng cel l-substrate in teractions is based on confocal 
microscopy. 
We provi de two arguments suppo rting the noti on that two-
photon microscopy provi des super ior data compared to confocal 
microscopy, especially when cell -seeded surfaces are being studi ed 
(So et al., 2000). First, confocal mi croscopy uses a UV laser whi ch 
damages cells more than does two-ph oton microscopy that is based 
on use of an IR laser. (Rubart, 2004;  Nikolenko et al., 2003; Schwille 
et al., 1999; So et al., 1998;  Yu et al., 1996). Among other 
advantages, the reduc ed photodamage available with two-photon 
microscopy enables long-term imagi ng of li ving preparati ons to study 
kineti cs of processes. Second, in the proposed quantitative study of 
the entire cell withi n the 3D environm ent of a scaffol d (rather than on 
a 2D surface) the depth of penetra tion available with two-photon 
microscopy (100-120 m) adequately encompasses a cell and 
nearest-neighbor scaffol d struts compared to the less-than-adequate 
depth of penetrati on available by  confocal  microscopy (30-40 m) 
(Rubart, 2004; Konig, 2000). 
Although we propose to occasi onally use both microscopy 
methods (confocal and two-photon) i n the earl y part of the study, we 
are cl early interested in developi ng long-term methodol ogy based on 
the less-well-developed but more p romising tw o-photon microscopy. 
Our ongoing collaboration with the MIT laboratory of Dr Peter So, one 
of the pioneers of two-photon excitation fluorescence i maging 
microscopy, provides us with a strong basi s for adapting this 
methodol ogy to sol ve the problems of interest. Preliminary data ( see 
below ) show clearl y that two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging 
microscopy can provide unprec edented quanti tative data on cell-
substrate interactions, including the total ligand dens ity of cell-free 
surfaces, D t, estim ates of the average bound li gand density per cell, 
Db, and 3D views of cell -scaffold sys tems that lead to descri ption of 
the di stribution of bound li gands  around the cel l surface, J(r, , z).</text>

          <text>In a second exam ple the maximum engaged li gand density that 
fibroblasts require in order to star t and the mini mum required to stop 
wound contraction i n the presence of a CGS are not known. Blocking 
of wound contraction by CGS is  a known requirement for induced 
regeneration (Yannas, 2005) . Knowledge of thi s type would all ow 
design of improved scaffolds and possibly smal l-molecul e 
approaches to regenerative acti vity. Contracti on force 
A third example is based on the recent use of CGS as a model 
substrates for study of cancer cel l proliferation and metastasi s. In this 
model it i s known that proliferatio n of certain types of cancer cell s 
requires attachment to CGS surface in an 21 integri n-specifi c 
adhesi on in order to prol iferate (Grzes iak and Bouvet, 2007) but i t is 
not cl ear just what kind of surface modification can bl ock cancer cell 
proliferati on. 
Finally, it has been shown that  an increase i n stiffness of CGS 
scaffold struts accelerates mi gration of certain cell types through the 
scaffold but the mechani sm for such  an effect is not understood 
(Harley et al., 2008). Cell mi gration is a basi c property that affects all 
studies of cell-scaffold interactions.</text>

          <text>presenting RGD groups than in 2D culture (Hsiong et al., 2008). In 
other studies differences between cell phenotype expression in 3D 
and in 2D were observed with cell adh esion (Cukierman et al., 2001), 
response to electri c stimulation (Sun et al., 2004) and cell migrati on 
(Maaser et al., 1998; Zaman et  al., 2006). There is widespread 
agreement that 3D surfaces are mu ch closer to surfaces of 
physi ological matri x (Alavi and Stupa ck, 2007; Tsai et al ., 2007). It 
has been also conceded recently  that avail able tool s for 
characterizing cell cultures i n 2D ve rsus 3D environments are diffi cult 
to compare (Ochsner et al., 2007). Th is may explain why very few, if 
any, rules have been developed to da te comparing cell behavior in 
2D and 3D environments. 
Scaffolds are archetypical 3D surfaces. A cell i nside a scaffol d 
with average pore size somewhat la rger than the cel l diameter is in 
contact with surfaces (scaffold s truts) almost all around its outer 
surface and bound ligand s are therefore distri buted around the entire 
cell surface. In contrast, on a 2D surface a cell  is making contact 
mostly on one side of its surfac e only. Advanced protocols for 
synthesis of tissues, such as those for cardiac tissue engineering 
(Radisic et al., 2008), make exte nsive use of the three-dimensional 
nature of the environment by cult uring cardiac cell popul ations on 
porous scaffolds. Collagen-GAG scaffo lds, well -known for thei r 3D 
structures, have been used over ma ny years to induce regeneration 
of the dermis, peri pheral nerves and the conjunctiva in animals and 
humans (Yannas, 2001, 2005). There is little doubt that scaffolds of 
one kind or another will be used more and more extensively in future 
applications of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Thi s 
expectati on increases the urgency wi th which i nvestigators seek to 
identify m ethodology for the quant itative characterization of 3D 
surfaces, especiall y scaffold surfaces.  
A description of ligand densi ty app licable to a 2D surface needs 
to be repl aced by a descripti on that applies to a 3D scaffold surface. 
The scalar quantity  for the ligand density of fl at surfaces, 
occasionally expressed i n the lit erature in units of pmoles/cm2 (e.g., 
Barber et al., 2005), must be repl aced by a function that describes 
the di stribution of bound li gands around  the entire cell surface. W e 
propose use of the vector distri bution function J(r, , z) for bound 
ligands that are distributed around the center of mass of a cell 
(centroid). This function can be determined for each cell  by two-
photon microscopy, as described in Methods. Data for a l arge</text>

          <text>Methodology for Measuring 
Surface Ligand Density
Prof. Ioannis Yannas 
What do investigators like to know about the surfaces of 
their biomaterials? Histori cally, the focus has shifted from studies of 
protei ns adsorbed on surfaces to assays of surfac e ligands for cell 
attachment. Currently, a large numb er of i nvestigators are interested 
to find methods for persuading cells  to modify their phenotype in 
order to achieve a useful  end resul t. Typical areas of interest among 
the biom aterials community are i dentif ication of specific substrates 
that induce a therapy (e.g., blo ck prol iferati on of cancer cells 
migrating on substrates) or a tiss ue-engineering synthesis (e.g., 
synthesis in vitro of a functio nal liver organoi d) or a desired endpoint 
in regenerative medicine (e.g., regen eration at the si te of a wound, 
rather than contraction or scar formati on). 
 The moti vation behind al l these di verse pursuits is the rapidly 
increasing appreci ation that insoluble surfaces are capable of 
changi ng cell phenotypes. Traditi onall y, cell regulation has being 
consi dered to be the domain of soluble regulators (cytokines, growth 
factors, hormones). Although insol uble surfaces were known to be 
capabl e of havi ng biologi cal activi ty from studies completed several 
years ago, the widespread appreciati on of this finding is a relativel y 
new development. In the biol ogical  and medical  communi ties li ttle 
attenti on has been traditionally paid to regulati on of cell phenotypes 
by insoluble, solid-like surfaces. Mo st of the studies of regulati on of 
cell phenotype by surfaces appear to  have historical ly originated with 
biomateri als scientists and engineers. 
Assay s of proteins adsorb ed on biomaterials surfaces  have 
been developed using increasingly sophisti cated physicochemical 
instrumentation. Extensi ve use has been made of time of flight 
secondary ion mass spectrometry (Henry et al ., 2008; Michel et al., 
2005; Wagner, Shen et al ., 2003; Wagner, McArthur et al., 2002; 
Lhoest et al., 2001); X-ray photoel ectron spectroscopy (Henry et al., 
2008; Michel et al., 2005; Wagner, McArthur et al., 2002); nucl ear 
labels, such as, 125I (Zhang and Horbett, 2008; Jenney and Anderson, 
2000); and electron spectroscopy  for chemical  analysis (Wagner, 
Horbett et al., 2003), among others.</text>

          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>In these studies the methodo logical focus appears to be 
identification of the proteins adsor bed on the surface to which cel ls 
adhere, as well as measurement of the protei n mass adsorbed, rather 
than a quantitative study of surfac e ligand densi ty res ponsible for cell 
adhesi on. In many studies a major objective of studies of protein 
adsorption on surfaces has been to improve understanding of in vivo 
response of biomaterial s surfaces to  substances such as blood. For 
example, in one study the adhesio n of platelets on 2D pol ystyrene 
surfaces that had been pretreat ed to adsorb fi brinogen was studi ed 
with methodological emphasi s on assaying the mass of adsorbed 
protei n and identifi cation of sites in volved i n platelet binding (Tsai et 
al., 2003). 
Quantitative methods for measu ring the ligand density  of 
surfaces. In a large number of st udies, two-di mensional (2D) 
surfaces were treated to prepare surf aces at various cal culated or 
directly assayed levels of ligand densi ty.  
Indirect (calcul ated) val ues of ligand density  have been 
published extensively. In these st udies a two-di mensional (2D) soli d 
surface i s typically i ncubated wi th a solution of the ligand and a 
certai n mass of the ligand is t hereby adsorbed on the surface. By 
changi ng the concentrati on of ligand adsorbate in sol ution, the 
investigators achieve desired degr ees of saturation and the li gand 
density is then simply calcul ated as the ligand ma ss adsorbed/area. 
In several  examples from thi s group of studi es, preparati ons of 
protei ns, known to be ligands f or certain cell types, have been 
adsorbed on 2D surfaces, e.g., nontissue culture plates. An 
illustrative example of this method invo lves the binding of platelets on 
the ligand molecule fibrinogen (Ji rouskova et al., 2007) . In this study 
the authors descri be preparation of  a surface with low-density 
fibrinogen, using a fibri nogen sol ution of 3 g/mL resulti ng in a 
surface density of approximately 80 ng/cm2 or 1.8 X 1011 
molecules/cm2; a high-density fibrinogen surface was also prepared 
using a solution of 100 g/mL, resulting in a de nsity of approximately 
500 ng/cm2 or 8.9 X 1011 molecules/cm2 (Jirouskova et al., 2007). In 
another study culture plates were exposed to solutions of the li gand 
molecule (fibronectin) at different concentrations, to produce what 
were described by the authors as  surfaces with different ligand 
density; migration speed studies of eosinophil s were then studied as 
a function of ligand densit y of the surface (Holub et al., 2003).</text>

II. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanism by which 
collagen-GAG scaffolds modify ce ll phenotypes in four  cases . The 
materials focus of this study is collagen-GAG scaffol ds (CGS). It has 
been known for years, from studies c onducted in the laboratory of the 
PI, that certain scaffolds of this  class can induce partial regenerati on 
of the dermis in ani mals and humans (Compton et al., 1998; Yannas 
et al., 1982, 1989), peripheral nerves in anima ls and humans (Harley 
et al., 2004; Chamberlai n et al., 1 998) and the conjuncti va in ani mals 
(Hsu et al ., 2000). In our Prel iminary R esults we report the first 
measurement of li gand density on  the surface of a collagen-GAG 
scaffold. 
At least two FDA-approved devices have been based on 
collagen-GAG scaffolds (CGS ). The first is IntegraTM, a dermis 
regeneration templ ate, first synthesi zed and tested with animals in 
the laboratory of the PI (Yannas, 1981; Yannas et al., 1981, 1982, 
1989). It i s currentl y used to induce synthesi s of the dermis in burn 
patients (Klein et al., 2005), in patients undergoing pl astic surgery of 
the skin (Blanco et al ., 2004) and in patients wi th chronic skin wounds 
and skin ulcers (G ottlieb and Furman, 2004). The second is 
NeuragenTM, a CGS scaffol d-based tube that i nduces reconnecti on of 
peripheral nerves across gaps of u nprecedented length. Rules for 
design of tubular scaffolds that  induce regenerati on of peripheral 
nerves across unprecedented gaps have  been described in detail 
(Yannas, 2001; Yannas et al ., 2006). There is evidence that early 
fetal regenerati on, a spontaneous process in mammals, is an 
appropriate model for induced regen eration of organs i n adults by 
CGS (Yannas, 2005; Y annas et al., 2007).  
Although a general  mechani stic explanation of the biological 
activi ty of certain scaffol ds at the cell-biologi cal level has been 
reported (Yannas, 2001, 2005),  there has been little quantitative 
characterization of the detail ed molecu lar features of their 3D surface 
that account for the unusual  biological  activity of these scaffol ds. For 
example, the maxi mum in dermis r egenerative activity of CGS in the 
pore size range 20-140 m (Yannas et al., 1989) is not understood. It 
is hy pothesized that the maximum in contraction-blocking 
activity  corresponds to a maxi mum in engaged ligand density .</text>

          <text>selectins. Once receptor-ligand bind ing is complete there is often 
induction of intracel lular signals th at may eventually modi fy the cell 
phenotype. Phenotype modification ma y include changes in migration 
speed, cell shape, regulati on of ce ll cycle, and others. Clearly, an 
assay of the density of bound ligan ds would be valuable to desi gners 
of biomaterials surfaces who wi sh to control  cell phenotype.  
Although reliabl e assays for free ligands on surfaces have been 
establ ished (see section immediately above) very li ttle methodol ogy 
appears to have been report ed for assaying bound  ligands. A number 
of biochemical and immunohistoche mical assays have been reported; 
in these reports, the emphasis i s on qualitative identification rather 
than on quantitative assay (e.g., see Schaff et al., 2007; Mould, 
2002). A quantitati ve assay was recen tly reported which is based on 
the use of a spi nning disc device in which the mean cel l detachment 
force is reported to be proportiona l to the number of adhesi ve bonds 
(Boettiger, 2007; Gallant and Garcia, 2007; Gall ant et al., 2005). This 
method could mark a very promis ing development provi ded it is 
coupled to a microscopy technique th at allows assay of the number of 
bound ligands. 
In this grant application we report prel iminary data that can be 
used to provide an estimate for the density of li gands that are 
engaged in cell  adhesion on a su rface. Imaging by two-photon 
microscopy can provide val ues of  ligand densi ty both on the cell-free 
and cell-occupi ed surface (see Methods) . Clearly, not all ligands on a 
surface are eventually engaged in ce ll adhesion. A suitable assay of 
a surface to which cells are adheri ng must therefore break down the 
total number of ligands measured on the cell-free surface, D t, into 
ligands that are engaged in ce ll-bindi ng (bound ligands), D b, and 
those that are not bound (free ligands), D f. 
Dt = D b + D f (Eq. 1) 
The total number of ligands, D t, can be assayed by imaging 
ligands on the surface of the cell -free surface, as described in 
Methods and ill ustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. D f can be obtai ned from Eq. 
1 by difference provided D b can be measured or estimated, as

          <text>TOPICS
Tissues (epidermis and endothelium) within the same tissue 
classification (epithelium) behave in similar ways in 
response to injury and in wound healing
Even tissues which can regenerate (epithelium) may not do so 
to fill defects which are too large (greater than the 
critical size)
The principal roles that biomaterials may play in replacing 
tissues or facilitating regeneration  may differ from one 
tissue to another in the same tissue classification
In some applications the principal beneficial role of the biomaterial 
may be to just maintain the physiological environment</text>

          <text>2Effect of Keratinocyte Seeding of Collagen -Glycosaminoglycan Membranes on the 
Regeneration of Skin in a Porcine Model.
Butler, Charles; Orgill, Dennis; Yannas, Ioannis; Compton, Carolyn
Plastic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery. 101(6):1572 -1579, May 1998.
A collagen -glycosaminoglycan matrix, impregnated with autologous 
keratinocytes, was applied as island grafts onto full -thickness porcine 
wounds to determine whether complete epidermal coverage could be 
achieved in a single grafting procedure. 
Grafts with seeding densities ranging from 0 to 3,000,000 cells/cm2 were 
used to determine the kinetics of epidermal coverage. 
Autologous keratinocytes proliferated as the collagen -glycosaminoglycan 
matrix was vascularized to form a confluent epidermis by 2 weeks in 
matrices seeded with at least 100,000 cells/cm2.
Irrespective of seeding density at 2 weeks the collagen -glycosaminoglycan 
matrix was well vascularized, contained a dense cellular infiltrate, and was 
almost completely degraded. These studies demonstrate that seeded 
keratinocytes proliferate and differentiate to form a confluent epidermis by 
2 weeks in matrices seeded with at least 100,000 cells/cm2.</text>

          <text>Hypotheses
-To engineer myocardium, biophysical regulation of the cells 
needs to recapitulate multiple signals present in the native 
heart.
-excitation contraction coupling, critical for the development 
and function of a normal heart, determines the development 
and function of engineered myocardium.
After only 8 days in vitro , electrical field stimulation
-induced cell alignment and coupling,
-increased the amplitude of synchronous construct contractions 
by a factor of 7, and
-resulted in ultrastructural organization.</text>

relations (cont.)
The architectural structure of collagen 
determines the function of collagen fibers as 
mechanical reinforcements of connective tissues (tendon, skin, bone, arteries etc.). Tendon
fibers 
are bundles of uniaxially aligned fibers that are crimped. Skin
(dermis) is a random planar array 
of crimped collagen fibers. Bone is a ductile 
ceramic (hydroxyapatite) which is reinforced by collagen fibers. Large blood vessels
(aorta, large 
arteries) are interpenetrating networks of elastin 
fibers and collagen fibers.</text>

Interaction of hydrophobic (nonpolar) AA with 
water leads to hydrophobic bonding. Primarily 
entropic, not energetic, bonding between molecules. It forces nonpolar macromolecules, such as elastin, to adopt a compact, rather then 
extended, shape in hydrated tissue. 
Stretching of elastin fibers leads to large entropy 
loss due to reduction in chain configurations and increased ordering of water molecules against nonpolar AA. Spontaneous retraction.

insoluble environment are increasingly 
important in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. 
 Several cases of cell phenotype regulation

A phenotype is any observable 
characteristic or traitof an organism : such

biochemical or physiological properties, or 
behavior . Phenotypes result from the 
expression of an organism's genes as well 
as the influence of environmental factors

          <text>Regulation of cancer cells by 
scaffold surfaces III.
Another, apparently critical, characteristic of migration of 
cancer cells on ECM-based substrates is the observation that cancer cells employ proteolytic mechanisms, apparently to 
overcome tissue barriers (Wolf and Friedl, 2006). In one 
example, depletion of a tumor suppressor protein BRCA2 from metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells greatly 
upregulated matrix degradation and promoted migration and 
invasion through the matrix; in contrast, overexpression of BRCA2 led to increased proteolysis of matrix due to 
downregulation of metalloproteinase-9 (Moro et al., 2008). In 
summary, there are reports in the literature showing clearly that cancer cell proliferation and metastasis depend strongly 
on integrin-specific adhesion of cells on matrix substrates 
and on modulation of matrix degradation by the cells. We conclude that understanding of the matrix environment is of 
critical importance in studies of cancer cell proliferation and 
metastasis.</text>

Specific interactions of cancer cells with the 
extracellular matrix have been associated with 
proliferation and metastasis .There is a steadily 
increasing interest of cancer investigators to cell-matrix 
interactions. Cell-matrix adhesion phenomena are 
widely reported in oncological research. Recently, 
adhesion to ECM has been defined as enabling and promoting cancer-related processes such as growth, 
survival, migration, extravasation, homing and 
metastasis (Schmidmaier and Baumann, 2008). Cell 
adhesion is cited as protecting from death by radiation 
and chemotherapy and adhesion molecules are 
overexpressed on drug resistant cells while clinical trials of anti-adhesion therapies are reported as ongoing 
(Schmidmaier and Baumann, 2008).</text>

          <text>Regulation of cancer cells by 
scaffold surfaces II.
Adhesion of proliferating cancer cells to the extracellular 
matrix (ECM) proceeds by molecular mechanisms that are becoming increasingly clear. A major development is the 
finding that proliferation of certain classes of tumor cells 
requires integrin-specific adhesion on ECM substrates. Several integrins have been implicated in  processes related 
to cancer cells. Recently, it has been shown in a large 
number of studies that the integrins implicated have been the 11 and the  21, both well-known for many years to be 
regulators of cell migration and adhesion on collagen-like surfaces. These findings with cancer cells have been supported strongly by demonstration that antibodies directed 
against one or both of these integrins have inhibited cancer 
cell proliferation in vitro or tumor growth in vivo. Examples can be cited from studies with several types of tumors, such 
as osteosarcoma tumor growth in mice (Miura et al., 2005), 
breast cancer tumor growth in mi ce (Weaver et al., 1997), and 
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro (Srzesiak and 
Bouvet
, 2007 ).</text>

stochastically independent. In contrast, a bove the threshold, the cells apply their 
individual forces in unison, developing m acroscopic tractions that are s ignificantly higher 
than they w ould be if  the cells ac ted indepe ndently. In addition, cel ls abo ve the th reshold 
apply the ir forces with a tim ing that a ppears to be correlated, i.e., highly dependent on the 
activ ity of  other ce lls in the system . The change in behavior  above the critical dens ity 
level is cons idered to be an exam ple of an  all or none tr ansition, som ewhat sim ilar to 
the m elting of  ice to liqu id water. 
In biolog ical term s the tr ansition is d escribed as a change in cell phenotype. In a 
given cell, A, such a change m ay be brought about by receipt of appropriate signals from 
other cells nearby. Signals issued from neighbors becom e bound on specific receptors on 
A; the bound signal is then tran sferred into the cyt oplasm  where it is directed toward the 
nucleus of A along a specific intracellular pathway. Inter action with the genom e brings 
about transcription of genes that m odify th e behavior of A along a specific direction. If 
the phenotype of a large num ber of cells of the sam e type as A becom es modified alo ng 
the sam e direction, the behavior m ay becom e cooperative, i. e., the affected cells all sh ow 
the sam e new behavior spatially and tem porally.   
Change in cell pheno type can be des cribed as an activ ated p rocess, i.e., o ne 
requiring expenditure of a finite am ount of energy. Using the term inology of activated 
rate p rocesses, one can represen t the trans ition in term s of an energy chan ge from  a state 
of noncooperating cells, n , to a state com prising coope rating cells, characterized by c , 
The transition to cooperative behavior o ccurs when noncooperative cells cross over an 
activ ation  hump, nc . It follows sim ply from transition sta te theory tha t such a 
trans ition is likely to tak e place freq uently when nc is low but it becom es nearly 
impossible to observe w hen nc is forbiddingly high relativ e to the two lower sta tes on 
eithe r side of the reac tion coordina te.  
Derivation of m odel of a critica l trans ition in cooperative cell behavior . Assum e cells 
exist either in n state ( noncooperative), in which they display the n phenotype, or 
they exist in  state c (coope rative) in which th ey exhibi t the c pheno type. Briefly, 
each phenotype represen ts a well-def ined beha vioral s tate of that cell typ e. The n 
phenotype can be described as being  characteri stic of cells th at are iso lated from  each 
other and m ay send out but do not  receive signals from  othe r cells that might indu ce a 
phenotype change from  n to c. W ith isol ated cells either there is little or no 
communication or else there is inten sive comm unication but the sign aling is inef fective in 
bringing about a phenotype change (the m odel does not inform about either one of these 
cases). In co ntras t, cells display ing the c phe notype are close togeth er and receive large 
numbers of signals from  other cells that ar e effective in changing their phenotype.  An 
exam ple of noncooperating cells are those de scribed by Freym an et al. (Biom aterials 
2001. 22:2883-2891): th ese cells app ly mechanical  forces to the extracellular m atrix 
independen tly of each other and th e force app lied by a system  of cells in creases in d irect 
proportion to the cell density. An exam ple of  cooperating cells is the assem bly of 
myofibroblasts at the edge of  a full-thickness skin wound; these cells generate forces that 
induce the onset of wound contraction and eventually m anage to close the wound 
(Yannas, Tissue and Organ Regeneration in Adu lts, Ch. 9, Springer, 2001).

We will app ly the m ethodology of statis tical mechanics. The goal is to determ ine 
certain requirem ent(s) for observing a critic al transition from  a noncooperative to a 
cooperative phenotype. 
Assum e a configuration A of 7 cells as a mini culture (o r mini collection ) of 
cooperating (c) and noncooperating cells (n): nccncnn . Assum e that these cells occu py a 
unit volum e dV. Another m ini cu lture B of 7 cells, occupies another unit volum e dV, and 
can be described as: nncncnn ; a th ird is d escribed as cncncnn , and so on for m ini cultures 
C, D etc. and for a very large num ber of m inicultures. 
The energy of  conf iguration A will n ow be  repres ented as the sum  of pairwise 
interactions between nearest-neighbo r cells. No  other interactions w ill be assum ed to be 
present. For exam ple, the m odel excludes c onsideration of intera ctions among three or 
more cells. Cooperative behavior implies co llective involvem ent of a large num ber of 
cells. The model will answer the question: If  only nearest-neighbor interactions (and no 
other m ore com plex inte raction s) are present,  can a critic al tra nsition still take plac e? 
Interactions between cell s in configuration A, nccncnn , that m ay lead to 
phenotype c hange, w ill be descr ibed by inte ractions betw een pairs of  cells, so that the 
total energy of  interac tion for conf iguration A  is: 
A=++++E +nc cc cn nc cn nn 
Each of the several configurations A , B, C,  etc. has a certain statistical weight and 
is more or less probable to occur. The statis tical weight of each pa ir-wise intera ction is 
represented by the appropriate Boltzm ann factor  of statis tical m echanics, i.e., as an 
exponential of the energy of interaction between nearest neighbors. For exam ple, 
(nc / RT ) is the energy of the first interacti on shown above. The sta tistical weight of 
the entire co nfiguration A is:  
A=exp(A RT ) = exp (nc +cc +cn +nc +cn +Enn ) RT = 
exp(RT ).exp ERT ).exp ERT )....= g .g.g.g.g.g.nc ( cc ( nc nc cc cn nc cn nn 
The statistical m echanical partition functi on (su m over all s tates ) is the sum  of 
statistical factors for all configurations A, B, C e tc.: 
 = confA + confB + confC +...

5. A model of a critical transition from no ncooperative to cooperative cell behavior. 
What is coo perativity in cell b iology ? Cells coop erate, i.e., co mmunicate with each o ther 
and acquire a common phenotype, following form ation of condensed states of biological 
matter. State s of this typ e com prise cells, usu ally em bedded in m atrix, th at are arr anged 
in clos e pro ximity with each other and freque ntly function as a single un it. Exam ples of 
such organized cell structures are contr actile cell capsules surrounding tissues in 
wounded organs, colum ns of Schwa nn cells, an d cords form ed by epithelial cells during 
skin synthes is. An example of a coo perative functioning unit is the contractile cell 
capsule that surrounds skin wounds and ne rve wounds during spontaneous healing. 
Cooperative activity can be disrupted by scaffo lds with specific bi ological activity, 
occasion ally resulting in ti ssue and organ regeneration. 
How do cells cooperate?  Cells cooperate by sending to a nd receiving signals from  other 
cells that lead to a chang e in phenoty pe that eventually leads to sim ilarity in behavior. 
Signals are typically m acrom olecules, such as  growth factors and cytokines of various 
types. Cell A sends a signal to a cell B in it s vicinity by secreting several m acrom olecules 
M that trav el by diffusion away from cell A,  even tually bindin g on recep tors on cell B. 
After bindin g on recep tors on cell A these macromolecular signals m ay modify the 
phenotype of cell B, which now behaves like cell A. 
The intensity of comm unication can be described by I, the rate of binding of 
macrom olecular s ignals on recep tors of cell B. The quantity I is the flux rate of signals 
transferred to B, i.e., the flux rate of signals that w ere actually rece ived by B. It m ay not 
be possible to detect the cell that has sent out the cells but it is  always possible, in 
principle, to m easure the signals  that have been received by a ce ll. The f lux rate of  signals 
received can be m easured as the num ber of  macromolecules that have becom e bound per 
unit surface area of cell B following a defined exposure to cells that em it such 
macrom olecules. Although inte nsity of comm unication is re quired, it does no suffice for 
cooperative behavior since cells m ust also  modify their phenotype, acquiring a common 
phenotype that characterizes the en tire assem bly of cells. 
Cells that do not cooperate  at all are referred to as  noncooperative (isolated). 
Noncooperative cells show an in trinsic behavior that is not  affected by the presence of 
other c ells in cultu re or in a tissue s ite. An operational definition of an  isolated cell is  the 
indifference of its behavior to changing levels  of cell d ensity in the system. These cells 
have m aintained their o riginal pheno type ei ther b ecause the intensity of comm unication 
with neighboring cells was insufficient fo r conversion to the c ooperative phenotype or 
because con version was blocked by a su fficiently high conversion energy. 
Critical tran sition . The behavior of cooperating cells differs m arkedly from  that of 
isolated cells. W hen the cell density, or ot her param eters that are currently under study, a 
key experimental param eter, is increased above a threshol d, cell behavior undergoes a 
sharp chang e.  An example is the m echanical  force exerted b y cells on matrix. Below the 
density threshold cells apply forces that are independent of cell density and are only 
charac teristic of  cell typ e (and oth er para meters, such as m edium  com position ). Such 
behavior is characteristic of point sources of m echanical for ce that act as if they were

Note . A m athem atically identical m odel can be u sed to desc ribe a helix-c oil trans ition, 
i.e., a thermodynam ic melting transform ation. Since the system is now described in 
therm odynam ic term s it is justified to use st atistical therm odynam ics argum ents (not 
presented here) in order to relate Z to Gibbs free energy via the relation (see, e.g., 
T.L.Hill, Introduction to Statis tical T hermodynamics ): 
G =RT ln Z +PV . 
As explained above, the two cases describe the outcom es. W hen Case 1 holds the m odel 
predic ts that a critic al tra nsition will take place at the helix-co il transition tem perature 
(the m agnitude of which, however, is not  predicted by the m odel).  The important 
prediction from  the m odel is that  only nearest-neighbor  interactions suffice for the critical 
trans ition. W hen Case 2 holds, the m odel predic ts that a c ritical transition will not take 
place. (See Ref. 1 for literatu re on th e helix -coil transition. )

=0 , a polynom ial of second degree. M has two roots, 1and 2, since it is a 2x2 
matrix. (For details of individual steps in  the derivation see an introductory text on 
Matr ix Alge bra.) 
M is related to the diagonal m atrix D by a sim ilarity transform ation. Diagonalize 
M to help in  raising M to the N-1po wer.  Since M and D are sim ilar, so are their N-1 
powers.

If N is large (m any in a conf iguration ), one te rm dom inates Z even if gcc is on ly 
slightly different than (or even equal to) gnn . This occurs when th e trans ition s tate

Here, the transition state energy Enc is of the sam e order of m agnitude as the 
energies of the noncooperative and coopera tive states.  No singularity occurs no 
matter what the re lation of gcc to gnn and no m atter what the m agnitude of N. 
Return to ra ndom ness. 
This m odel shows that n eares t-neighbor in teractions are sufficient for an all o r 
none cooperative transition pr ovided that the energy cost of the hybrid state is 
much higher than nn and cc and also provided the sequence is long enough 
(larg e N).   
This m odel describes certain requirem ents for an all-or-none cooperative 
transition but does not predict the cond itions under which the transition takes 
place. Such a condition would be, e.g., a cr itical thresho ld of the cell density.

          <text>Which tissues in the triad do not
regenerate spontaneously?
When excised from an organ, the epithelia
are regenerated spontaneously. 
Examples: the epidermis in skin, the myelin sheath in nerves.
Likewise, the basement membrane
regenerates spontaneously on the stroma.
However, the stroma does not regenerate
spontaneously. Examples: dermis in skin, endoneurium in nerves.</text>

          <text>The central question is
Epithelia and basement membrane (BM) are 
synthesized from remaining epithelial cells.
The stroma is not synthesized from remaining 
stromal cells. Instead these cells induce 
closure of the injury by contraction and 
synthesis of scar. 
Therefore, the central question in organ 
synthesis is how to synthesize the stroma.
Once the stroma has been induced to synthesize, epithelial cells can spontaneously synthesize both epithelia and BM over it 
(sequential synthesis).</text>

I. Reactants
Cells migrate, proliferate, synthesize 
matrices and cytokines, degrade matrices, 
etc.
Cytokines are soluble molecules that 
diffuse. They serve as languagebetween cells.
Matrices are insoluble macromolecular 
networks and do not diffuse. They control cell behavior (phenotype) via integrin-
ligand binding. Usually porous 
(scaffolds).</text>

Investigators typically supply (add) reactants 
based on favored hypotheses. Often, reactants supplied are not required to 
synthesize tissue or organ.
In vitro all reactants, including culture 
medium, are supplied by investigator.
In vivo the reactor spontaneously supplies 
exudate that contains certain reactants 
(endogenous reactants). The investigator 
supplies other reactants (exogenous).

In vivo reactors are anatomical sites of

Experimental in vivo reactors are 
generated by surgical excision (scalpel, 
laser, etc.). 
When organ synthesis takes place in vivo 
at the correct anatomical site of living 
organism it is referred to as induced 
regeneration.</text>

III. Products
Organs are made up of tissues.
Products  of the synthesis can be 
tissues or organs.
Almost all organs are essentially made up of three types of tissues: epithelial, basement membrane and 
stroma (connective tissue).

Capsular contracture occurs when the scar tissue or capsule that 
normally forms around the implant tightens and squeezes the 
implant. It may be more common following infection, hematoma 
(collection of blood), and seroma (collection of watery portion of 
blood). There are four grades of capsular contracture. 
The Baker grading is as follows:
I     the breast is normally soft and looks natural
II   the breast is a little firm but looks normal
III  the breast is firm and looks abnormal (visible distortion
IV  the breast is hard, painful, and looks abnormal (greater 
distortion)
Additional surgery may be needed to correct the capsular 
contracture. This surgery ranges from removal of the implant 
capsule tissue to removal (and possibly replacement) of the 
implant itself. Capsular contracture may happen again after this 
additional surgery.

          <text>http://www.implantforum.com/capsular -contracture/
How can Capsular Contracture be prevented? 
Massage and or compression. This is usually only done with 
smooth implants and may be suggested for a period between a 
few weeks to as long as you have your implants. Do not massage 
bruises! 
The "no -touch" technique. This method includes meticulously 
rewashing surgical gloves before handling any instrument and 
implants. Only the head surgeon touches the implant, using a 
unique Teflon cutting board and immediately inserting the 
implant underneath the muscle. All of these measures help 
ensure that no foreign substance attach themselves to the 
implant, which could inflame the surrounding tissue and cause 
complications such as capsular contracture.BREAST IMPLANTS

What is Capsular Contracture?
Scar tissue that forms around the implant which causes the breasts 
to harden (similar to what a contracted muscle feels like) as the 
naturally forming scar tissue around the implant tightens and 
squeezes it. While capsular contracture is an unpredictable 
complication, it is also the most common complication of breast 
augmentation. 
How can Capsular Contracture be prevented? 
Textured implants help deter contracture because of their rough 
surface which is intended to discourage a hard capsule from 
forming. 
Under the muscle (sub -pectoral or 'partial sub -muscular') 
placement of the implant reduces risk of capsular contracture by an 
average of 8 -10%. Whereas over the muscle (in front of the muscle 
or 'sub -mammary') has 10 -25% or more chance of capsule 
contracture. BREAST IMPLANTS

Myelinated axons (diam. 1-15 m) are

nonmyelinated axons also exist. They are the elementary units for conduction of electric signals in the body. Myelin formed by wrapping a Schwann cell membrane

Structure . Endoneurial microenvironment 
surrounding each nerve fiber comprises blood 
vessels coursing through space filled with fluid and thin collagen fibers (51-56 nm diam.). Fluid outside blood vessels is maintained under small, positive hydrostatic pressure. 
Endoneurial blood vessels comprise cells that 
are bound by tight junctions and constitute a permeability barrier. 
Function . Endoneurial environment protects 
nerve fibers from changes in ionic strength and from pathogens in blood vessels that might modify conductivity (blood-nerve barrier).</text>

          <text>5. Synthesis of a nerve 
trunk (including kinetics)
Structure . A nerve trunk comprises one or more 
fascicles. Each fascicle comprises several thousand 
nerve fibers. If monofascicular, it is covered by perineurium; if multifascicular, it is covered by 
epineurium. A fascicle comprises the perineurium with 
its bundle of thousands of nerve fibers. Some nerves comprise many fascicles, each with its own perineurial sheath; these fascicles are wrapped in a 
collagenous tissue, the epineurium. 
Function . Conducts strong nerve signals (amplitude 
about 10 mV) at conduction velocity of 70 m/s. 
Compare speed of sound: 343 m/s in dry air.</text>

Stratified Squamous Epithelium
(epidermis) 
The cells of the basal layer of the epidermis  (closest to the dermis) are cu boidal to 
columnar in shape. These cells are actively mitotic, pr oducing new cells that get pus hed 
upward into the overlying layers. As these ce lls are pushed up, they become flatter and 
longer taking on the typical squamous shape.  When the cells reach the top, they are 
sloughed off and replaced by cells from belo w. The dermis which underlies the epidermis 
is composed of a dense, irregular conne ctive tissue, which we will see again later.</text>

Top View Cross-Sectional View 
Simple squamous epithelium, which genera lly occurs as a thin sheet-like layer 
allowing for minimal resistance to diffu sion, is also been called "pavement 
epithelium, because it can look like like  paving stones as seen from above.  
Examples include the linings of the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial 
cavities. Other places simple squamous  epithelium can be found include: the 
glomerulus of the kidney, the walls of ca pillaries, and the alveoli of the lungs.</text>

Simple Columnar Epithelium
(small intestine) 
Since columnar cells are quite thick, they do  not readily allow  passive diffusion.  As a 
result, these cells use active transport to move nutrients through them from the 
intestine to the blood. This is what we co mmonly call " absorption."  To help with this, 
they have numerous microvilli on their apic al (lumenal) surface, which increases their 
surface area to allow for greater absorption.</text>

The collagen scaffold was implantable and safe 
over 3 -yrs.
Histologically, it supported regeneration of 
tissue in meniscal defects of various sizes.
No adverse immunological reactions were 
noted.
At 3 or 6 months after implantation, gross and

Collagen Scaffold. Prelim. Data
K Stone, et al., J. Bone Jt. Surg. 79 -A:1770 -1777;1997
One patient, who had had a repair of a bucket -
handle tear of the medial meniscus and 
augmentation with the collagen scaffold, had 
retearing of the cartilage nineteen months after 
implantation. Another patient had debridement 
because of an irregular area of regeneration at the 
scaffold -meniscus interface twenty -one months 
after implantation.
Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated 
progressive maturation of the signal within the 
regenerated meniscus at three, six, twelve, and 
thirty -six months. These findings suggest that 
regeneration of meniscal cartilage through a 
collagen scaffold is possible. Additional studies are 
needed to determine long -term efficacy.</text>

          <text>TISSUE ENGINEERING
What is tissue engineering?
Production of tissue in vitro by growing cells 
in porous, absorbable scaffolds (matrices).
Why is tissue engineering necessary?
Most tissues cannot regenerate when 
injured or diseased.
Even tissues that can regenerate 
spontaneously may not completely do so in 
large defects ( e.g., bone).
Replacement of tissue with permanent 
implants is greatly limited.</text>

          <text>ROLES OF THE BIOMATERIALS/ 
SCAFFOLDS
1)the scaffold serves as a framework to support cell migration 
into the defect from surrounding tissues; especially important 
when a fibrin clot is absent. 
2)serves as a delivery vehicle for exogenous cells, growth 
factors, and genes.
3)before it is absorbed a scaffold can serve as a matrix for cell 
adhesion to facilitate/regulate  certain unit cell processes 
(e.g.,  mitosis, synthesis, migration) of cells in vivo or for cells 
seeded in vitro .
a)the biomaterial may have ligands for cell receptors (integrins)
b)the biomaterial may selectively adsorb adhesion proteins to which 
cells can bind
4)may structurally reinforce the defect to maintain the shape of 
the defect and prevent distortion of surrounding tissue.
5)serves as a barrier to prevent the infiltration of surrounding 
tissue that may impede the process of regeneration.</text>

Issues to be Addressed
Should the tissue be produced in vitro, for subsequent 
implantation, or in vivo ?
What scaffold should be used?
Material of fabrication, pore characteristics, absorbability, 
mechanical properties?
How to be manufactured?
What cells are to be used?
Source of cells?
Under what conditions can cells be expanded in number in vitro
while retaining their phenotype?
What regulators are required to stimulate cell 
proliferation and matrix synthesis or to facilitate 
differentiation of stem cells?</text>

Clinical
Pain relief.
Problems:  Can only be evaluated in human subjects and 
the mechanisms (including the placebo effect) and kinetics

Problems with Tissue Engineering
Most tissues cannot yet be produced by 
tissue engineering ( i.e., in vitro ).
Implantation of tissues produced in vitro
may not remodel in vivo and may not 
become integrated with (bonded to) host 
tissue in the body.
Solution
Use of implants to facilitate formation 
(regeneration) of tissue in vivo.

Current Status
No one has yet employed Tissue Engineering methods 
to fully regenerate any tissue that does not have the 
capability for spontaneous regeneration*.
The Integra skin has no hair or glandular structures and its 
architecture is close to but not identical to normal dermis.
The Carticel cartilage is not articular cartilage.
Experience has taught us that full regeneration may 
not be necessary to achieve a meaningful clinical 
result ( e.g., pain relief, recovery of function, esthetics)
How close to regeneration is good enough?

          <text>ROLES O F THE BIOMATERI ALS/ 
SCAFFOLDS (MATR ICES) 
1) the scaff old serves a s a frame work to supp ort cell migrat ion 
into the def ect from surroun ding tissues ; especial ly important 
when a fibrin clot is abse nt. 
2) serves as a del ivery vehicl e for exogenous cel ls, grow th 
factors, and genes; large surface area. 
3) befor e it is ab sorbed a scaf fold can serve as a m atrix for cell 
adhesion to facilitate/regulate  certain unit c ell proces ses 
(e.g.,  mitosis, synthes is, m igration) of cells in vivo or for cells 
seeded in vitro. 
a) the bioma terial may have ligands for cell receptors (integ rins) 
b) the bioma terial may selectively adsorb adhesion proteins to which 
cells can bind 
4) may structural ly reinforc e the def ect to m ainta in the shap e of 
the defect and prevent distort ion of surroun ding t issue. 
5) serves as a barri er to pre vent the infil tration of surrounding 
tissue that may i mpede the proc ess of regener ation.</text>

          <text>Injury to adult ECM is irreversible
Summary :
1. After severe injury, and in contrast to the fetus, the 
adult heals most organs irreversibly (no regeneration). 
2. Most organs are made up of three basic tissues 
(tissue triad): epithelia, basement membrane, and 
stroma.
3. Epithelia and basement membrane are spontaneously 
regenerative; the stroma is not.
4. Therefore, the central problem in biomaterials selection 
for organ replacement by regeneration is synthesis of the stroma.

The central problem in organ 
regeneration is regeneration of the 
stroma. Once the stroma has been

Most supporting tissues (stroma) that surround nerve fibers are not regenerative. 
Thus, while nerve fibers can regenerate following a transection, the other tissues in the nerve trunk cannot regenerate. After transection, the nerve trunk stumps become neuromas -- clumps of scarred tissue that close largely by contraction.Figure by MIT OpenCourseWare.</text>

Infrared SpectroscopyInfrared SpectroscopyAuger Electron Spectroscopy
Energy analysis of Auger electrons emitted from a sample. 
electrons are produced as a result of ionizations in inner 
core shells under impact of an electron beam.
Significant intensity occurs for Auger electrons emitted 
with energies up to 2500 eV and these typically have a characteristic range between 1.5 and about 10 atom layers 
(0.4 to 3 nm).
AES is sensitive to about 1% of most elements except H 
and He in the outermost atom layer and, generally, some of the atom layers just below the surface.
The excitation is by an electron beam with energies in the range 5 keV to 25 keV.
These beams may be focused to spot sizes of &lt; 12 nm in 
most modern instruments.
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA)
Energy analysis of photoelectrons emitted from a sample 
generated from core leve l shells under impact by 
characteristic X-rays, usually Al or Mg Ka.
Photoelectrons have energies  up to 1500 eV and typically 
have a characteristic range between 3 and about 8 atom 
layers (1 to 3 nm).
XPS has a similar sensitivity to AES.
It is sensitive to about 1% of most elements except H and He in the outermost atom layer and,  generally, some of the atom 
layers just below the surface.
This allows the composition to be  determined as a function of 
depth to 10 nm below the surface, non-destructively. Figure 7 from Ratner removed due to copyright restrictions.</text>

Surf. Prop. of Biomat. in Biomat. Sci. Eds., B.D. Ratner, et al., Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1996Based on the principle that a monochromatic wave 
impinging on a regularly arrayed structure (e.g., a 
crystal) will be diffracted at specific angles only, 
related to the spacing between the features in the 
array ( e.g., molecules).
The wavelength of radiat ion needs to be on the 
order of (or less than) the spacing to be detected.
The diffraction pattern is a unique identifying feature 
of the material.Diffraction Methods

Mass analysis of positive or negative ions emitted from 
samples under impact of an energetic ion beam.
Significant intensity can occur for ions with masses up 
to and beyond 1000 a.m.u. that originate mainly from 
the outermost molecular layer.
The fragments observed in the spectrum reflect the precise molecular groups on the surface.
This allows distinction and identification not possible by 
AES and XPS but only where suitable reference spectra 
are available.
SSIMS has a very much higher sensitivity than AES or XPS, but quantification is much more complex since 
matrix effects are dominant. Infrared Spectroscopy

Equilibrium between the liquid droplet and solid 
surface has been reached ( i.e., no absorption of 
liquid by the solid and no leaking of substances 
from the solid).
If this assumption cannot be met then the "advancing 
angle" can be measured to determine the contact 
angle of the liquid with the dry surface and "receding 
angle" measured to determine the contact angle with 
the water absorbed surface.
An alternative method is to measure the underwater (captive-air-bubble) contact angle that an air bubble 
makes with the immersed surface.  This is 
particularly valuable for measuring surface that can 
switch from hydrophobic to hydrophilic depending on 
the environment.

          <text>Conclusions on the Effect of Matrix 
Stiffness on Cell Contraction
The contractile force generated by fibroblasts 
was independent of matrix stiffness in the range 0.7  10.7 N/m.
Contractile forces generated by cells are force-limited, not displacement-limited. 
As cells elongate, cell-matrix adhesion sites hypothetically form at the cell periphery, increasing length of matrix strut under 
compressive load and decreasing load required 
to buckle the strut.</text>

          <text>Conclusions on Micromechanics of 
Fibroblast Contraction
The aspect ratio of cells increases with 
time and eventually saturates, just as the force does. 
Initiation of cell elongation occurs stochastically. 
The force plateau most simply results 
from buckling or bending of individual 
struts in the matrix by cells.  
Matrix deformation (contraction) occurs as 
a result of cell elongation, not cell 
contraction.</text>

          <text>Conclusions on Linearity vs. 
Cooperativity of Fibroblast 
Contraction of Matrix
The contractile force increases linearly 
with cell density.
The average contractile force is calculated 
at 1 nN per cell.
The time constant for development of 
force is also independent of cell density. 
In this model cells must develop contractile forces individually, not cooperatively.</text>

          <text>Lubricin/Superficial Zone Protein/PRG4
A glycoprotein synthesized by synovial cells and identified in 
synovial fluid was found to provide the principal boundary 
lubrication for articular cartilage of joints (Swann 1977).
Later a protein synthesized by chondrocytes in the superficial 
zone or articular cartilage (named superficial zone protein; 
Schumacher 1994 ) was found to be homologous with lubricin.
Prg4 is the name given to the gene that was found to encode these 
homologous glycoproteins (Ikegawa 2000) .
Proteins with various structures, properties and functions may 
result from this same gene as a result of alternative exon splicing 
during gene expression, and post translational modification of the 
protein.
Four such spice variants have been found for human and mouse.
Lubricin/SZP has been found on the surface of meniscus, and in 
tendons and ligaments.</text>

          <text>Theory to Explain  -SMA and Lubricin in 
Periprosthetic Tissue
The micromovement of a prosthesis stimulates the 
expression of  -SMA and lubricin
directly as a result of mechanical stimulation of selected 
cells
indirectly by inducing macrophages to release elevated 
levels of TGF -, which up -regulates  -SMA and lubricin
Myofibroblast ( i.e., -SMA expressing fibroblast) 
contraction activates latent TGF -1 from extracellular 
matrix.

          <text>Conclusions on biological activity of 
scaffolds used as regeneration templates
1. Certain ECM analogs are biologically active scaffolds 
(regeneration templates) that i nduce regeneration of tissues and
organs: skin, peripheral nerve and the conjunctiva (eye) in humans 
and experimental animals.
2. Regeneration templates lose their activity if the following 
structural features fall outsi de a narrow range: chemical 
composition, collagen quaternar y structure, pore diameter, 
degradation rate.
3. The data suggest that templat es induce regeneration in a defect 
by blocking selectively the cont raction process that leads to 
closure of the defect in adults.
4. Templates block contraction by two basic mechanisms. First, by 
downregulating differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. 
Second, by binding most of the contractile cells in the defect over a 
period corresponding to the duration of contraction in that defect. 
Binding requires the presence of appropriate ligands (chem. composition) at a minimal density (pore diameter) over a critical 
duration (degradation rate).</text>

Platelets are cells involved in blood clotting. They 
form clots in contact with collagen quaternary 
structure (banding). Platelet clots release 
inflammatory factors (cytokines, growth factors that 
kick off the inflammatory response. Melting of

          <text>Degradation rate of implanted polymer
The mass of undegraded polymer, M, often decreases 
according to the differential equation:
dM/dt= kM
The solution is: 
M(t) = Moexp(-kt)
where Mois the mass at t = 0 (undegraded polymer) and k
is the rate constant for the degradation reaction.
At the half-life 1/2:
M= Mo/2 
1/2= 0.693/ k
which allows calculation of k.
Example of use . The regenerative activity of a scaffold was 
observed to be maximal when its degradation rate was 
approximately equal to the rate at which new tissue was 
being synthesized in the wound.</text>

and Debye length of an electrolytic solution
The ionic strength of an electrolytic solution is:
I= (1/2)mizi2
where m = molarity of ionic species, and z is its electric charge. 
I is closely related to  the Debye length via the factor nizi2.
The distance over which the electrostatic field of an ion extends with 
appreciable strength can be calculate d using the equation for the Debye 
length, 1/b :
b2   =  (4e2/kT) nizi2
1/bhas dimensions of length ~ thickness of ionic atmosphere. It is a measure of 
thickness of the ionic atmosphere. E.g., in a 1M aqueous NaCl solution, 1/b = 
0.3 nm.  Increase in ionic strength leads to shrinking of Debye length.
e, electronic charge
, dielectric constant of medium
k, Boltzmanns constant
T, temperature (absolute)
ni, number of ions of type I per unit volume
zi, valence of ion type i
Conclusion : In solutions of very high ionic strength, the electrostatic interaction 
between ions becomes very weak. This results in dissociation of collagen-GAG ionic complex and makes it necessary to induce covalent crosslinking
of GAG to collagen to maintain the association at neutral pH.</text>

          <text>Density of ligands increases with decrease 
in average pore size of scaffold (cont.)
Example . In a scaffold with average pore diameter 10 m that 
was grafted inside a skin wound a volume density, c, of 
myofibrolasts of order 107/cm3 porous scaffold was 
observed. For this scaffold the specific surface is 
calculated (using a simple geometric model) at about 8 X 
104mm2/mm3; therefore, 1 cm3of scaffold is characterized 
by a cell surface density of c= c/= 107/(8 X 104) = 125 
cells/mm2. For another scaffold, with identical chemical 
composition but with pore size as large as 300 m, cis 
the same as above; however, the specific surface is 
calculated  at only 3 X 103mm2/mm3 and the volume 
density is only c= c= 125 X 3  X 103 =3.75 X 105 per cm3
scaffold. 
Conclusion . The scaffold with the smaller pore diameter (10 
m) has a volume density of myofibrolasts that is about 27 
times higher than that with the scaffold that has the larger 
pore diameter (300 m).</text>

          <text>Crosslink density of a network
The crosslink density of a macromolecular network 
is reciprocally related to the average molecular 
weight, Mcg/mol, of a network chain (chain 
length between two neighboring crosslinks).
From the rubber elasticity equation:
Mc= 3RT/E 
Measurement of E (under conditions where rubber 
elasticity holds) gives the properties of the network.

          <text>Calculation of collagen/gelatin ratio
in transparent films based on IR 
spectroscopy
When a substance absorbs radiation the relative amount 
absorbed can be used to determine the concentration of 
the component that absorbs. Beers law gives:
A= kc
where A is the absorbance at a particular wavelenth, k is a 
constant and cis concentration of the absorbing 
component.
Example of assay for gelatin content. Measurement of Aat 
the infrared frequency of 1230 cm-1(amide III band) for 
thin films of collagen and gelatin shows that collagen 
absorbs more strongly and eventually allows calculation of 
the relative mass of collagen/gelatin in an unknown film using the ratio A

a graft copolymer . Solvents with high ionic strength fail to 
separate the grafted polymers from each other. The 
copolymer is stable at neutral pH. Crosslinking GAG to collagen decreases degradation rate.
