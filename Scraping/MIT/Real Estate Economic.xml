What is a real Estate Market?
 Within markets all properties should 
move together: high substitutability, easy 
mobility.
 Between markets there exists frictions, 
transportation costs, immobility of 
resources and low substitutability.

With offices, building booms follow rents. The booms 
then generate falling rents = endogenous cycle?

Prices and Development
 Prices bring forth develo pment: of any urban land 
use..
 Development occurs so as to maximize the 
residual value between: Price-capital costs 
(construction). 
 This residual is land value. Development 
maximizes land value. 
 Land Development is a natural real option: incur 
heavy capital costs to real ize an income stream 
or- wait (to do the same later) ?</text>

Real Estate Macro-economics: Real 
Estate Cycles and Secular Trends
 What are real estate cycles? Truly independent 
oscillations or just reactions to the economy.
 Cycles vary with Property type. 
 Cycles are related to broader capital markets.  
 Secular trend: growth rates of the stock 
(construction) slow as economy matures. 
 Secular trend: Prices adjusted for inflation rise

Real Estate Micro-economics: 
Cities and Land Markets
 No two properties are identical [complete product 
differentiation]
 Properties are close if not perfect substitutes for 
each other  at some price differential. 
 Price differentials are extremely large, and very 
predictable. 
 Price differentials tend to be stable over time: 
local neighborhoods do not have independent 
cyclic movements.</text>

Week 6: Retail Location and 
Market Competition. 
 Retail Real Estate must understand Retailing (a 
Business) to correctly attract tenants.
 Patterns in Retail location, travel and shopping 
behavior.  
 Classical theory: trip freq uency, price competition, 
entry and the determination of retail density. 
 Neo-classical theory: retail clusters, inter-store 
externalities, shopping centers, incentive leases.

Store Mix and Shopping Centers

Store revenue Ri= Ri(S1 Sn) 
Complimentary/Competitive: Ri/ Sk&gt;&lt; 0  
Draw power: Ri/ Sk&gt; 0 for all i (e.g. Anchors).  
Center Revenue: = Si Ri(S1.Sn)
The rent stores are willing to pay depends on: their 
expected revenue  which depends on the overall mix!
Given fixed S, allocate space (Si) to maximize rent.
Landlord: Charge high rent to stores that live off of other stores, charge lower rent to stores that draw customers and create synergy = rent discrimination.

Centers, Main Streets, BIDs,  
Traditional Business Districts
 Stores are attracted to each other  to the degree 
they do not compete. This is not necessarily 
efficient! [examples]
 Centers won the battle against older business 
districts partly from location, but also from the 
mix/management advantages of centers.
 BIDs and Main Streets solve the mix issue only if 
they are owned and managed in entirety. 
 Arbitrage. Buy up the disconnected stores in an 
old business district and run as a center?</text>

Explanation for Percentage Rent
 Risk Sharing: tenant pays fixed rent, absorbs 
business risk if landlord more risk adverse. If both 
equally risk adverse =% rent [why only retail?].
 Not a substitute for fixed rent [notice that tenants 
paying higher fixed tend to pay higher % as well]
 With fixed rent, landlord can relet space to the 
detriment of existing tenants  and face no consequences until their leases renew.
 With percentage rent, landlord faces immediate 
loss in rental revenue if his actions in any way hurt the sales of existing tenants [Wheaton]</text>

How will the Retail system respond to 
higher Gasoline Prices? 
 People want to shop more locally.
 Less cross hauling  driving to other than the 
nearest center.
 Centers located near population masses do well, 
those remotely located suffer. 
 Neighborhood and Community Center Sales 
expand. 
 Stores previously locating in larger centers and 
catering to lower income consumers now willing 
to increase outlets and locate more locally.</text>

- As f doubles (population) the distance 
between stores less than halves. Hence sales per store rise. Is the average (clothing) store 
larger in larger MSAs (NBER paper 9113)?
- store selling more frequently purchased 
items (v) have more dense distributions.
- stores with high fixed costs [showroom

Transportation: the real explanation for 
Historic appreciation (or lack thereof). 
	Average commute speeds were 3 mph in 1840 
(walk). 
	Increase to 7 mph with trolley cars (1870). 
	Then 15 mph with more modern subways 
(1910). 
	Cars average about 25 mph (1950-Today). 
	8-fold increases in speed have offset 8-fold 
increases in travel distance as NYC grew from
300,000 to 12 million households!

increasing at the rate g because of high gas prices and 
worsening transport congestion (sound familiar).

(d) in time t is:
Rt(d) = (raq+ c) + kt (b0 d)

With much effort the price/rent multiplier 
today for existing structures is: 
P0(d)/R0(d) = 1/i + kb0g /i[i  g] R0(d) 
As we examine farther locations where rent 
is lower this term implies a greater price 
multiple or lower cap rate. Why?
With no growth [g=0] the multiple is the 
inverse of the discount rate  at all locations

3). Expenditure Decision : what level of G 
maximizes the value of household assets? 
- In the hedonic equation each dollar of 
spending increases P by 1/i dollars. 
- However in the budget identity the cost of 
spending is less than 1/i because of C,A, etc. 
Hence the solution says spend away! 
- More realistically, there is diminishing 
marginal utility from increased school 
spending and hence as G rises its impact on  P 
becomes less than 1/i. [Bogart] .</text>

Vermont Property Taxes: the Howard Dean story
 1978: Vermont enacts a statewide uniform property tax to 
fund schools. Town taxes drop in poorer areas and rise in 
rich (resort) towns  as funds are transferred. 
 2003: New Legislation provides that 2ndhomes will be 
taxed at 2x primary residences for the state tax. 
 Taxes in resort towns will now double and services stay 
the same (there are no schools in Killington, Vt.).
 Killington, Vt. Threatens to secede Vt. (and join New 
Hampshire).
 What will the tax incidence be? Structure? Land? 
Residence?
 Taxes do not depend on the structure per say, but who 
occupies it (resident or skier)! 
 Residents can afford to pay more for any house than can a 
skier from NY! Stay Tuned.</text>

- Prices are higher when towns have more                   
commercial property (C). 
- Prices higher with more state aid (A). 
With an increase in either, taxes drop, causing prices to rise, 
causing taxes to drop further, but there is a solution.</text>

Urban Decay: the whole Philadelphia Story
 Middle class flight starts from the central city. 
 Those left (the poor) have high service usage -vs-
the property value they live in =&gt; taxes rise.
 Higher tax rates cause property values to fall.
 City enacts extra tax on those who work in city.
 Firms now must pay workers not only for higher 
commute in from suburbs but also for wage tax.
 Firms leave (C falls) and property tax rises further.
 With empty neighborhoods, crime rises, schools 
deteriorate =&gt; back to top. 
 Why do the poor stay?</text>

Some Issues
 What about 2ndhome properties?  Towns on Cape 
Cod or cities in Florida. 
 Some states have passed legislation that allows 
cities to tax commercial property at a fraction 
(higher or lower) than residential property. This is 
called classification (Waltham). 
 If you are the mayor of a town would you tax the 
local industrial park higher or lower? What does 
the data show?
 What about rental property. What do tenant voters 
want [Oates]?</text>

1).  The Town Budget Identity
t  =  (G - A ) 
P/(1-C)
t = town residential effective tax rate
G = total town expenditure/household
A = state aid received/household     
P = average market value of houses in town
C = % of total property value that is 
commercial (assumes C does not influence G)
Hence Tax rates depend on housing prices</text>

2). Capitalization: Hedonic regression 
equation valuing PDV of town services (G) 
and tax payments (tP) in addition to housing 
characteristics (whose rent is R), [Bogart] . 
With complete capitalization the coefficient 
on services is 1/i and on taxes 1/i. Wh y?             
P = [R+G  (tP)]/i
Then, on solving for price:
P = (R+G)/ (i+t)
Hence Prices depend on tax rates</text>

Lease - versus  Own?
 Tax implication? Leases are deductions, as are debt 
payments. 
 Accounting implications? Only ownership shows on the 
balance sheet ( loophole).
 Corporate Prestige. But you can easily purchase the 
naming rights to a building.
 Firm Specific Capital. Facility has little other use, and so 
developer would charge higher lease payments since 
residual value is zero. Holdup issue.
 Expansion and other options.[see: Benjamin, et.al.] 
 Correlation between firms busi ness and local real estate 
market. 
 If your corporate cost of capital is Ic, how is IcP&gt; &lt;  R ?</text>

Lease (Rent) Fundamentals:
 An Efficient forward market implies:
R t,n= R t,n-m+ R t+n-m,m
[The first superscript designates the date for which 
occupancy begins, the second the lease term]
or:  the difference betwee n a three year lease and a 
5 year lease signed today equals a forward commitment (three years hence) for a 2 year lease. 
 Hence if the market is expected to improve, longer 
lease terms command a higher average rent and vice-versa.

Model #4 ( continued)
 Behavioral  implications of slow adjustment:
 Each 1000 FIRE workers needs 283,000 square feet and 
each Business Service worker 118,000. Adding this much 
square feet per new worker would also keeps vacancy (occupied square feet) constant in the long run.
 To get to these targets, occupied square feet responds 
slowly  10% quarterly or 35% yearly (leases).  
 At current rents of $30 and vacancy of 16%, construction 
will add only 50,000 square feet quarterly (.2 m annually)
 And at 16% vacancy rents will fall below $30. 
 This is far less than job forecast demand is! 
 Hence market goes down and eventually recovers (blue).</text>

Waiting = Development as a Real Option
 Competitive model (Tobins Q): develop as soon 
as when Prices equal replacement cost. 
 But what if prices are stochastic, uncertain?
 If wait and they go down  little lost.
 If wait and they go up  a lot gained!
 Hence wait. Until Prices cross a hurdle = 
replacement cost + option value = exercise price
 Greater uncertainty = higher option value = longer 
delay to development since exercise price is 
higher.</text>

Forecasting Lessons
 When supply adjusts quickly to prices or rents, then 
little is to be gained from a model that jointly 
forecasts the two  Just use a Univariate model (#2) 
(Single Family Housing )
 The slower supply responds and the more gradual 
prices and rents adjust, then the more you need to 
forecast both sides of the market (#3 or #4) to 
capture its momentum and cyclic swings.

What determines confidence band width?
 A market with wide historic swings will tend to 
generate wider confidence bands in the future 
unless you can explain these swings accurately. 
 A poor model (low fit) means you do not 
understand the forces affecting the market. What you 
dont know = risk. 
 Low quality data, missing observations, a short 
historic data series, no variables that capture what really drives the market = a poor model.</text>

Development Options and Overbuilding
When we all wait, its more likely that multiple players 
exercise the option at the same time. 
Exercising at the same time = a building Cycle
(Grenadier).  
When there are more players (increased competition), 
the option value of waiting is eroded. Why? Because competitors can take your place and pre-empt you. 
If you are a monopolistic developer  there is no fear of this!  (Schwartz and Torous)
Are property types with more competition, or locations with more competition less prone to overbuilding, since 
no player waits? (Somerville).

R = 3.23 + .92R-1 - . 01T
(2.5)    (22.1)       (.6)

 No trend in realoffice rents (.09 is not significant).
 Rents depend an awful lot on last periods rents (.92)!
 R* = (3.23-.01T)/ (1-.92) = $(40-.12T) (long term steady 
state rents in real dollars)

What if market participants delay?
Slow adjustment increases instability
 Gradual adjustment of space demand to changes in 
employment and rents. Why? Only 20% or so of tenants 
can move each year given lease contracts. 
 Gradual adjustment of rent to vacancy. Lease contracts 
make the leasing decision like an investment  there are option values to both parties to waiting [Grenadier]. Waiting pushes the supply response further into the future

Development Options and Development Lags
 Lags are delays between when you exercise the option 
(commit) and when you realize the Price. 
 Lags mean that the impact of uncertainty on the option 
value is less than without lags (develop sooner). 
 The option value of waiting is le ss because if good times occur,
and it take you several years to bu ild, by the time you build they 
may have vanished. Without lags you can immediately realize the 
good times value! 
 However, for a given level of uncertainty the hurdle value
is higher with lags than in a model with no construction lag 
(develop later). 
 Intuitively, the further into the future the realization of your
investment return, the smaller its present value.  Therefore, you 
optimally wait until the Price is high er (all else equal) in order to 
commence development when there are lags between exercise and 
realization of Price as opposed to instantaneous realization of Price 
upon exercise.</text>

What are Real Estate cycles
 A reaction to a shock in the underlying 
economic demand for the property: national or 
regional recessions and economic boom periods. 
[e.g. single family residential, industrial, 
apartments] 
 A periodic overbuilding of the market - excess 
supply  that originates from capital or 
development activity and is not necessarily linked 
to demand movements. [e.g . office, hotels, retail?]

Model #3: Conditional Rent/Construction 
Multivariate  (continued)
 The estimated demand side or rent equation becomes:
 R = 7.6 + .94R-1 + .04FIRE + .02SER  - .00013S-1
(2.9)   (17.1)     (2.1)          (3.2)          (-3.9) 
R2= .976
 Also need a supply side equation:
 C = 449 + 39.7R-10-.007S-1
(.9)     (2.9)         (-2.2)         R2= .41

Model #4: Multivariate with Vacancy
 But Landlords also determine rents as a function of 
vacancy. Why (bird in hand = 2 in bush)? 
R = 6.5 +.81R-1- .34V-1
(6.0)  (20.1)     (-6.9)           R2= .958
So in theory, with the pair of equations, there is a rent 
where vacancy is fixed (stable).  And for supply:

Distribution of Forecast Outcomes
 A forecast is the mean value of the variable(s) 
being forecast. Any forecast has a probability 
distribution surrounding it.
 The further out you go the wider is the forecast 
probability distribution of possible outcomes. Why?
 Variables that are random walks are forecast with 
simulations  wherein the starting value plays no role. With mean reversion, real estate forecasts 
obviously depend on where the market currently is.

 FINANCE 101: Cap rate = i-g+r
i = risk free rate + capital expenditures
g = expected future value/income growth
r = real estate risk premium
Efficient prices are lowest when the market is 
most down . With mean reversion, thats when 
expected rent/income growth is highest! 
 With traditional or extrapolative pricing, cap 
rates are lowest when the market is strongest 
(continued rent/income growth) and highest when the market is down (continued decline).</text>

Valuing Property: 
Efficient Asset Pricing Principles
 Use future rent and income forecasts that are based 
upon the model (i.e. assume all market participants 
use the model to evaluate the change in E)
 Future Residual values are DCF from the residual 
date forward
 Since todays value is DCF until residual date plus 
residual value, the hold period is irrelevant: todays 
value is the in-perpetuity DCF.
 Result: Price Volatility low and less than income 
volatility since income volatility is only temporary (with mean reversion)</text>

The Shiller Test
 If market pricing is rational cap rates should correlate 
negatively (if imperfectly) with actual future (subsequent) 
growth. Efficient markets can at least partially anticipate the 
future.
 Why werent cap rate spreads higher in the late 1980s 
anticipating the tanking of the market, and lower in the early 1990s  anticipating the market recovery?

Model #3: Conditional Rent Multivariate
R - R-1= .06 [(125+.66FIRE +.33SER - .0021S-1)  -R-1 ] 
 For every 1000 FIRE jobs added to the economy, if we 
develop 307,000 more square feet then long term steady 
state real rents will be stable . 
 For every 1000 Business Service jobs added to the 
economy, if we develop 157,000 more square feet then long term steady state real rents will be stable.
 Rents adjust to gap: Steady State - current rent
 If rents are at $35 real, then construction will average 
about 600,000 square feet each quarter or 2.4m annually.
 FIRE growth of 7,500 jobs annually or Business service 
growth of 15,000 jobs annually would justify this. But the 
forecast is for each to grow about  of these! Hence new 
supply exceeds demand, rents stagnate (Green)</text>

Model #4: Multivariate:
Rent, Supply and Vacancy (slow response)
 Suppose firms desired occupied stock is:
OC* = 4109 + 283FIRE + 118SER - 76R-1
 But leasing constrains tenants so that only 10% can get to 
their desired stock in a period. Hence:
OC - OC-1=
AB = .10 [(4109 -76R-1 + 283FIRE + 118SER)  - OC-1] 
(30.6)  (2.1)    (-3.4)     (2.6)         (1.9)

Model #1: Implied Rental Adjustment 
R = 3.23 + .92R-1 - .01T,  is the same as:
R - R-1 = .08 [ (3.23 - .01T)/.08  - R-1 ] 
= .08 [ R*  - R-1 ] 
 Rents adjust slowly (8% quarterly or about 28% annually)  
to gap between: Steady state rent ($40-.12T)  current rent
 More rent lags = more zigs and zags in the adjustment 
process, but around what?
 Nice and clean, but what have we learned? Trend!

 Suppose Rent equates space demand to last periods stock

 Call that  R* = 125+.66FIRE+.33SER - .002S-1
 But then Suppose Rents adjust gradually:
R - R-1= .06 [(125+.66FIRE +.33SER - .0021S-1)  -R-1 ] 
 Note that real rents still adjust slowly, but now to changes

Employment Dispersal and commuting
 If people can commute only inward (not true but a useful 
assumption!). Then the number  of people traveling inward 
at any point is the difference between the cumulative 
number of jobs located up to that point and the cumulative 
number of workers living up to that point.
Proof: if the number of inward travelers at distance (t) is 
less than this difference then not all jobs up to t are being 
filled. If the reverse, then there are more commuters than 
jobs up to t and jobs beyond t are not being filled. 
 Implication: jobs must be more  centralized than residences 
for positive traffic flow in the allowed direction. 
 With complete job-residen ce dispersal: no commuting!
 With centralized employment traffic worst at the edge of 
the business district</text>

Overly large CBD will have commercial land value 
(red) &lt; residential land value (black). 
Hence office rents &lt; replacement cost
-Lower rents must compensate for higher wages to overly large center.
- Eventually sunk cost buildings will deteriorate and not be replaced, 
hence the center will shrink

The same argument is at work 
within central cities. The stock of 
office space is fixed at various 
locations (streets) within major 
CBS districts. Yet these locations 
offer different access  in this 
case to mass transit lines. How 
can locations that require an extra 
10 minutes walk pay higher 
wages? By paying less rent  at 
least until buildings deteriorate 
and then are built only on top of 
transit stops!
10 minute walk x 2 x $30 wage x 
250days/200 sqft = $12.50 rent

Should Office Rents be higher in larger Sub 
centers? (Archer-Smith, 2003)
 Yes, if residential rents are higher from longer 
commutes. 
 But that necessitates an offsetting 
agglomeration or other advantage (how to 
distinguish between the two?). 
 No if larger sub centers have better transport 
systems (thats what makes them larger).
 Yes, if as centers grow, they bump up against 
boundary zoning constraints.</text>

Wage as well as Rent Gradients
 In a location equilibrium, no one wants to change the 
location of either home or work. 
 For workers at a particular plant  what insures that they 
are indifferent to different residential locations?  Housing 
Rent (Lecture 2). 
 For residents at a particular home location what insures 
that they are indifferent to switching jobs?  Different 
Wages . Jobs closer to the center must pay for the 
incremental additional cost of commuting: hence a Wage Gradient. 
 But: cities do not have inward-only commuting!</text>

What if zoning limits the amount of 
commercial space at a desirable location
 A center with a good transportation system (for example)  
is supposed to grow and expand until its advantage is 
eventually eroded through longer commutes (at higher speeds). 
 Without this growth, its advantage will remain and without 
greater commuting, net wages will be lower  hence commercial land values will ri se above residential and 
office Rents (for existing buildings) will rise to absorb the 
advantage. 
 The existing buildings have a sunk Entitlement that 
cannot be competed away with more development.</text>

How Polycentric Balanced Use Cities react to 
rising Travel Costs
1. Firms move more to where their workers live: Suburban 
office development reduces commuting. 
2. Workers get less picky about residential locations and 
move closer to their suburban workplaces. 
3. Residential development downtown generates a nearby 
workforce for firms and also helps eliminate commuting.
4. The result: Cities where jobs and population are better 
aligned spatially.
5. Balanced (mixed) Land Use make life easy, interesting 
and more productive. Higher transport costs force
greater Balance.</text>

Heterogenous Workers/Available Housing.
 Workers are not all the same   many firms need a diverse 
mix of workers
 The model of dispersal assumes that either (1) local 
workers are employable, or (2) each firms workers can 
find local housing.
 What if each town has only housing/workers of a particular 
type? 
- Only firms using that type of wo rker would want to locate there.
- Firms would need a much wider commute shed to secure workers = 
higher travel costs erode the suburban wage advantage. 
 Is the CBD the site with best access to all type of Workers 
in the region? What about Headquarters? [Shilton]</text>

Why firms leave the CBD for a Subcenter.
 Subcenter workers at d5pay the same for land as 
CBD workers living there, but have a shorter 
commute. Hence their wage must be less by the 
difference in commute: (d5d1) versus (d2d5).
 Note that land rents still make workers that are 
employed at each center indifferent about living at 
different locations around thatcenter. 
 Firms at the CBD now must not only pay higher 
land rent (equal here to residential), but must also pay higher wages for labor. 
- Wages: 15% more [e.g. $13,500]
- Rent (per worker): 250 x $15-20 [e.g. $4250]</text>

driving is at least as great as the private cost of

- If you are traveling 60mph and value time at $10 
per hour: the congestion toll is $.16 per mile ($3-$4 per gallon).
- If you are stuck at 20mph its closer to $.50 per 
mile or $10-$15 per gallon!
- Worse MPG=lower fuel toll per gallon (its a tax

Solutions to Public Good/Externality Problems.
Scale :single (collective) ownership of a large parcel of 
land insures few negative and many positive externalities 
at development stage (Thorsnes shows development scale 
matters  lots are worth more in big developments) 
 Single owner maximizes the total value of development 
sacrificing value at one location if such a sacrifice creates more value at other locations. 
 If development ownership is fragmented  each fragment 
considers only what best for his portion.
 Is the whole always worth more than the sum of the 
parts? [Liquidity  versus  ext ernalities]. Does the price 
of an acre decrease/increase with the size of purchase?</text>

- People drive too often and should double up
- Trips are too long (land uses too spread out)
- Transit and other less congestion-prone
modes are not used enough
- Peak periods of travel need to be broadened: work 
hours need to be spread out. 
- When development creates traffic it needs to be 
taxed/regulated (!) Not only for local infrastructure, but for 
regional Traffic impacts as well.
- Impacts beyond local jurisdiction borders suggests

In the Long run: 
1). If regions vary in 
productivity (demand 
shifts in red): wages 
and rents will be 
positively correlated 
across areas. 
2). If they vary 
because of amenities 
(supply shifts in blue): 
then wages and rents 
are negatively 
correlated across areas.

Regional Economic Growth
 Export production, Federal government or 
private transfers (social services, investment 
earnings) and direct investment all 
determine regional growth: demand.  
 Satisfying regional demand takes factors of 
production: labor and capital (real estate).

The answer? Greater Urban Productivity
 Recently, nominal wages have been 40% higher in 
big cities than outside metro areas
 Cost of living may explain why labor doesnt 
flock to cities, but why do firms stay?
 Higher productivity and Wages
 Cities have greater human capital?
 Cities attract better labor? Or do cities facilitate more 
accumulation of human capital?
 Cities create productivity through proximity of firms

more than once over the time period. Dependent variable is 
price change between sale date s. Independent variable is

Bargaining theory: Negotiated price lies between 
BMO and SMA, assuming that BMO&gt;SMA
P  =  B M O  - [ B M O  S M A ]
(Solving for P  which is also part of the 
formula for SMA)

iL 1 + 2iL
Outcome: price moves almost inversely 
to sales time: hence proportionately to sales and inverse to vacancy = a High elasticity</text>

quality (PQ=100k in previous example) is:
u = PQ [ i (1- t) - P/P]
What is Impact of: P (level)  versus - P/P (price

15). And households are freely able to move and buy at 
different locations (different values of Q) within the 
market then should not the annual cost of owning one unit of Q  (U=u/Q) be constant across locations? Then:
P =  [P + U]/i(1-t)

Vacancy = a spell (length of time)
Rental:
Vacancy rate = Incidence rate x Duration
Incidence rate = % of units loosing tenant 
per month.
Duration = # months necessary to lease up
Owner:
Average Sales time = Vacant Inventory/
Sales (units/month)
[or # movers/month]

Predicting Prices involves predicting 
Sales, Vacancy and Duration. 
1). Sales are complicated: ne w households, marriages and 
divorces, lateral mobility, tenure changes.. 
2). Some evidence that sales are pro-cyclic: mobility is helped 
by income security, but much is un-researched. 
3). Vacancy is much easier  = housing stock  occupied units 
(also called households)
4). Construction adds to the housing stock. 
5). Changes in  ex ante demand (growth in population, 
household split ups.) impact household formation and 
hence occupied units.  
6). Households ( ex post demand) is different from  exp 
ante demand which is the number of potential households.</text>

The importance of correctly measuring Price
1). Prices versus Quantity versus Expenditure 
P: price of the same thing over time
(OHHEO index)
Q: Physical quantity and quality of space (how to 
measure).
E = PQ: how much you spend
(NAR average price of house that sells)
2). For new houses (1.2m SFU annually)
P/P = 4%,  Q/Q = 4%, E/E = 8%  (1965-1990).
3). For all houses (6m Sales annually)
P/P = 7%,  Q/Q = .5%, E/E = 7.5%

7). What does it cost to own one unit measure of Q? This 
obviously influences how many measures you want. 
8). Sometimes it can cost you nothing to own a home. 
[example: 100k property, 100% LTV, 8% interest, 6% 
appreciation, 25% marginal tax rate:

Theories of Vacancy and Prices (or rents).
1). If vacancy is always constant , at some structural rate 
V*, prices must be adjusting quickly so that ex ante = ex 
post = stock(1-V*). Implication: ex ante and ex post
demand are difficult to distinguish. This is the Theory of 
structural Vacancy 
2). With large systematic vacancy movements, prices or rents 
must be sticky and not adjusting quickly. Implication: ex 
ante can be measured and distinguished from ex post .  This 
characterizes commercial real estate (next).
3). What determines ex ante housing demand? 
Demographics? Income?</text>

Maintenance, Improvements, and 
expansions as Supply
 It is rational to let buildings eventually deteriorate. 
With discounting, the net benefits of maintenance 
decline over time. 
 Major improvements, expansions constitute a huge 
annual market (30% as large as new 
development).
 Improvements are rational and are more likely 
to occur when housing is a good investment (i.e. 
low P and high expected P/P ).
 The Elderly improve less  = another way of 
consuming your housing equity!  (instead of a reverse mortgage)</text>

What impacts the concentration of the 
Home Building Industry (T. Somerville)?
 Builders are bigger in high volume MSA 
markets (i.e. each builds more).
 Concentration (e.g. top 10 share) does not change 
as market volume and market size vary.
 Thus high volume markets do not have more, 
same size builders, but rath er the same number of 
builders  each building more units.
 Equals  = Monopolistic competition. 
 Larger # of regulatory agencies (towns) leads to a 
greater number of smaller builders. Why?</text>

Optimizing House Configuration
 Builders and developers compare the incremental 
value of additional house features against their 
incremental cost. 
 Profit maximizing house: where the cost of an 
additional square foot, bath, fireplace falls to the marginal cost of construction. 
 But what about land, lot size, density or FAR? 
 FAR: floor area ratio (ratio of floor to land area).
 Density: units per acre. 
 Density x unit floor area = FAR
 % of lot open = 1-(FAR/stories) (stories&gt;FAR)</text>

 Assume that historic properties have 75% of 
the structure value versus new. Hence the 
value of 1 acre of 4-story brownstones is:
4 x [166.5-1.48x4] x 43560 =  27m
 Thus even with significant demolition costs 
the current historic stock might be ready for

Optimal Urban Design
What if you are building a ski resort? Or 
Designing a new town, or a Resort?
Determine how much your clientele discounts FAR. 
Determine how much your clientele is willing to pay for access  to the urban Center: ski lifts, beach, town center. 
At each location from the center figure the optimal FAR and residual land value. 
Develop accordingly. What do Ski resort FAR patterns look like?</text>

How does actual land use evolve?
Real City Development evolves gradually: from 
the center outward  always on vacant land at the edge.
At each time period, there is a shadow value for interior land that is already built upon. 
When does that shadow value exceed the entire value of the existing structures?
Fires, disasters create vacant land  shaping development
Where does redevelopment happen?</text>

At better locations, the price of housing at any FAR is 
higher. This yields a substitution of capital for land  and 
the optimal FAR rises  helping to offset rise in Prices.

Urban Housing
 Great diversity from historical evolution, changes 
in technology and tastes. 
 Multiple attributes to each house: size, baths, 
exterior material, style.location
 Consumers value each of these attributes with the 
normal law of micro-economics: diminishing 
marginal utility.  
 Huge industry has evolved to applying statistical 
models to understand and predict diverse house 
prices:

Modern Industrial Location
Why do industries locate:
- Next to Highways
- Next to Airports or seaports
- On land that is recycled, wet, or marginal
But also:
- In areas already developed.
- Near to population?
