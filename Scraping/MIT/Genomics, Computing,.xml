          <text>Precursors to cell growth
How to define the growth function.
The biomass composition has been determined 
for several cells, E. coli and B. subtilis .
This can be included in a complete metabolic 
network
When only the catabolic network is modeled, 
the biomass composition can be described as 
the 12 biosynthetic precursors and the energy 
and redox cofactors</text>

          <text>Under-Determined System
All real  metabolic systems fall into this category, so far .
Systems are moved into the other categories by measurement of fluxes 
and additional assumptions.
Infinite feasible flux distributions, however, they fall into a solution 
space defined by the convex polyhedral cone.
The actual flux distri bution is de termined by the cell's regulatory 
mechanisms.
It absence of kinetic information,  we can estimat e the metaboli cflux 
distribution by postulating objective functions(Z) that underlie the 
cells behavior.
Within this framework, one can address questions related to the 
capabilities of metabolic networks  to perform functions while 
constrained by stoichiometry, lim ited thermodynamic information 
(reversibility), and physicochemical constraints (ie. uptake rates)</text>

          <text>FBA - Linear Program
For growth, define a growth flux where a linear 
combination of monomer (M) fluxes reflects the known 
ratios (d) of the monomers in the final cell polymers.
A linear programming finds a solution to the equations 
below, while minimizing an objective function (Z).  
Typically Z= growth(or production of a key compound).

This course will focus on understanding aspects of modern 
technology displaying exponential growth curves and the impact on 
global quality of life through a weekly updated class project 
integrating knowledge and providing practical tools for political 
and business decision-making concerning new aspects of 
bioengineering, personalized medi cine, genetically modified 
organisms, and stem cells. Interplays of economic, ethical, 
ecological, and biophysical modeling will be explored through 
multi-disciplinary teams of students, and individual brief reports.
Specific (standard) skills to be developed: statistics, modeling,

Each student will participate in a class-wide project to provide 
decision-making tools for global/local technology development and 
deployment. Each will have a web page or wiki describing and 
updating their part of project going by the second class.
Grades will be based on 
25% participation(round robin),  25% personal wiki page (weekly) 
25% contribution to group project/ article, 25% peer evaluations
No prerequisites.  It is assumed that each of you brings some 
expertise to be integrated with the goals and talents of other team 
members.  Each student should make  this clear at the start of the 
project and update it as the course proceeds.</text>

"Economics has been regarded as a non-experimental science, where 
researchers  as in astronomy or meteorology  have had to rely 
exclusively on field data, ..  however, these views have undergone a 
transformation. Controlled laboratory experiments have emerged as a 
vital component .. &amp; have shown th at basic postulates in economic 
theory should be modified. .. cognitive psychologists who have 
studied human judgment and decision-making, and experimental 
economists who have tested econo mic models in the laboratory. ..
Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith ."
(see also: Judgement under Uncertainty 1974 Science 185:1124)
Cognitive bias .. includes "very basic statistical and memory errors 
that are common to all human beings and drastically skew the 
reliability of anecdotal and legal ev idence &amp; significantly affect the 
scientific method."</text>

How do we make decisions? How do we bridge?
Not "right vs wrong", nor "moral relativistic flip-flopping"
What is the maximum discrepanc ies between societal benefit 
vsactual strategies?  And how do we find them convincingly?
What are the reasons for such? Do "special interests" 
represent lags in the knowledgebase of the decision makers.  
To what extent and by what means do we avoid oscillation?</text>

The Singularity Is Near : When Humans Transcend Biology
The Law of Accelerating Returns by Ray Kurzweil
An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological 
change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense "intuitive 
linear" view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 
21st century -- it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at 
today's rate). .. ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward 
in the universe at the speed of light.

Monte Carlo.
Uniformly distributed random variates Xi= remainder(aXi-1/ m)
For example,  a= 75           m= 231 -1
Given two XjXksuch  uniform random variates,
Normally distributed random variates can be made 
(with X= 0     X= 1)
Xi=  sqrt(-2log(Xj)) cos(2 Xk)     ( NR, Press et al. p. 279-89 )</text>
