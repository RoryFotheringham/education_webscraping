          <text>What to look for
	Nonstandard uses 
(Cheerios = snack) 
	Interactions with environment 
(shaking the blender) 
	Customization 
(no desktop) 
	Intangible attributes 
(Pull-on diapers = growing) 
	Unarticulated needs

          <text>Ethnographic observation
	Requires trained observers, extended videotaping,
sophis ticated coding &amp; editing 
 Especially helpful in: 
	Tracing complex consumer activiti es and processes 
(using equipment, software, purchase process) 
	Understanding low involvement activities, where 
consumers awareness is li mited (routine shopping) 
 Detecti ng new fashions or trends</text>

          <text>3 Qualitative interpretation
 Main part of the report 
 Look at To Save or to Spend as a model 
	Organize main sections around main topics in the 
affinity diagram 
	Summarize the customers voices in your own 
words, using direct quotes as support</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>Example (tourism)
	Voice: I dont like organized tours - you are stuck in a 
bus with other tourists, and herded from place to
place 
 Possible need statements 
Allow for people to leave and rejoin the bus tour if they
want. 
(solution) 
Dont burden the schedule with too many events. 
(negative, solution) 
Enhance contact and appreciation of the local people and
environment. 
(good) 
Directly and spontaneously experience a new culture. 
(better - multi-valued, more specific benefit)</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>Step 4 - Develop a new solution or concept
 Read section R18 in Voices into Choices 
	Run a short brainstorm for each of the Level 2 categories 
in the affinity diagram (5-10) 
	Sift (vote), improve, and combine ideas into an integrated 
concept or solution</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>Step 3 - Create an affinity diagram
 Schedule a group meeting 
 Read section R17 in Voices into Choices 
 Bring flipchart and requirement sheets to meeting 
 Review need statements and finish 
 Copy needs onto Post-It notes 
	Following the guidelines in R17, organize the 20 or so 
requirements into 5-10 Level 1 categories 
 Label the Level 1 categories with titles 
 Repeat to produce 2-4 Level 2 categories</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>7</slideno>
          <text>5 What has been learned 
&amp; future research 
	Attempt to identify a possible solution to the 
motivating problem for the project, such as: 
 a new product concept 
 statement of the most significant deficiency or problem 
 a definition of desired brand or company image 
	Indicate briefly key uncertainties  about your 
concept/solution</text>

          <text>Presentation

 1 or 2 presenters 
 Suggested sequence (but you can modify): 
 State objective 
 Highlight key parts of affinity diagram

          <text>Step 1- Identifying key voices (&lt;25)
	Team member 1 reads a 
voice and puts it on the 
flipchart 
	If someone else has a similar 
voice, they stack it on top of the first one 
	When TM 1 has finished their 
pile, TM 2 begins with their 
voice 
	When everyone else is done, 
select 20-30 key voices</text>

          <text>Step 2 - Voices into needs or benefits
 Place each key voice on top of requirement sheet 
 Quickly jot down 1-3 key ideas in the voice 
	Write a need or requirement statement in the bottom of 
the sheet 
 Identify a need that motivates the or iginal voice 
 Avoid solutions 
 Be concr ete and s pecific 
 Use multi-valued language 
 Use positive, action-oriented language</text>

          <text>Summary
	The key goal of qualitative research is to identify all 
potentially relevant issues. 
	Direct questioning is of limited value because people may not be aware of the real reasons for their feelings or choices, 
and resort to obvious or conventional explanations. 
	Projective  questions and tasks have no obvious answer, so 
the customer must be creative and self-revealing 
	ZMET combines a projective method with a  depth 
interview 
 Your project will do the same.</text>
