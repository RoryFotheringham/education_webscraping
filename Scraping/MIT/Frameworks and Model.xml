it can put management on what

          <text>27 the precise definition of 
scenario is:  a tool for ordering ones perceptions about alternative future environments in which ones decisions might be played out.
 scenarios are vehicles for helping people learn.  Unlike 
traditional business forecasting or 
market research, they present alternative images of the future; they do not merely extrapolate the trends of the present.
The purpose of scenarios is to help yourself change your view of 
reality -- to match it up more 
closely with reality as it is, and reality as it is going to be.

SCHWARTZ APPROACH
Schwartz ( The Art of the Long View), 
on the other hand, proposes an eight-
step approach:
1. Identify focal issue or decision
2. Identify key factors in local 
environment
--These are the key factors -- locally --
which influence the success or failure 
of the decision or focal issue 
identified in Step 1 
3. Identify driving forces in macro 
environment 
-- Social, economic, political, 
environmental and technological 
macro issues might behind the local

OF THE LONG VIEW
Why scenarios -- an imaginative leap 
into the future
How can you see, most clearly, the 
environment in which your actions will 
take place?
How will those actions relate to 
prevailing forces, trends, attitudes and 
influences?
HOW
Invent, and then consider, in-depth
several stories of plausible futures.
THE POINT
Make strategic decisions that will be 
sound for all plausible futures.
No matter what future takes place, you are more likely to be ready for it if you have thought seriously about scenarios.

 too many people react to uncertainty with denial.  They take 
an unconsciously deterministic 
view of events.  They take it for granted that some things just cant and wont happen; for example, oil prices wont collapse, or the Cold 
War cant ever end. Not having 
tried to foresee surprising events, 
they are at a loss for ways to act when upheaval continues.  They create blind spots for themselves.

          <text>33COMPOSING A PLOT
The scenario-planner looks at 
converging forces and tries to understand how and why they might intersect -- then extends that imagination into coherent pictures of alternative futures.  Thats what 
gives texture to scenarios.
Your goal is to select plot lines 
that lead to different choices for the original decision.  What plots might make you do something different?

1. System behavior often

readily predict emergent 
behavior -- even if we 
understand the subsystems.

work -- if you focus on single 
sectors, the results may be 
counterproductive.
3. The system may be policy-
resistant! -- Perverse 
interactions.

          <text>5FOUR IDEAS FROM 
COMPLEXITY THEORY
Four ideas from complexity theory that will 
help us think in new ways about how to 
improve the metropolitan development 
system:
1. Simplification results in fundamentally wrong 
answers, and focus on individual sectors 
separately will be counterproductive.
2. Effects cannot be directly linked to causes 
because an intervention reverberates through the system in ways that  can only be partially 
traced.
3. Even small changes introduced to the system 
may produce discontinuous, unpredicted effects.
4. Adaptive changes within a system can grow 
from learning generated by the individual interactions in the networks of system 
participants.
from: Metropolitan Development as a Complex System:  A 
New Approach to Sustainability, Judith E. Innes and 
David E. Booher, Working Paper #699, University of California at Berkeley, December 1997.

          <text>3CHARACTERISTICS 
OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS
1. Change with time
2. Feedback, both positive and negative, 
with time delays
3. Non-linear in behavior and interactions, 
including threshold effects
4. Small changes in inputs or interactions 
may lead to big effects (the butterfly 
effect)
5. Causes and effects differ in space--
spatial disconnect
6. Causes and effects differ in time--
temporal disconnect
7.  Causes and effects differ in nature--
substantive disconnect
So 5, 6 and 7 imply it is hard to link causes 
and effects
8. Adaptive -- Systems and agents within 
systems can learn
9. Systems may evolve toward complexity 
to achieve better performance, e.g., the gas turbine originally had one moving 
part
10. Stochasticity

SD and the CLIOS Process
 SD is considered a tool in the CLIOS Process 
toolkit.
 SD as a way of thinking shares a lot of 
similarities with the CLIOS Process but it is not 
explicit with regard to the nested complexity. 
 CLIOS Diagrams can be a good starting point 
for creating SD models.
 Preliminary SD models can be a good starting 
point for engaging stakeholders and making 
explicit their tacit knowledge.

Shower: a metaphor and the origin of SD
 Achieving the right temperature is a control 
problem: there are delays in the system even 
if uncertainty is removed.
 Other control problems: driving, flying a plane. 
Humans and machines can learn to anticipate 
and adjust to short term feedback delays.
 The modeling part of SD originates from 
control theory and servomechanism design.
 Jay Forrester in the 1950s at MIT was the first 
to adapt those ideas to policy applications.

You have all used / developed 
models/frameworks in your earlier? 
Subjects.
For example
Falling body  predict velocity on impact.
Mathematical equations models allow us to 
predict.
What in the real world do we abstract out?

Linear vs. Non-Linear
Linear vs. non-linear models is a good 
example of the trade-off between constructing models that can produce 
answers relatively easily versus models 
that represent the world better but turn 
out to be more difficult to solve in 
generating actual answers.  
Linear vs. non-linear models illustrate the 
trade-off between reality in representation 
and ease in generating solutions .

Solution Techniques
Getting answers from the model is fundamental 
to what transportation professionals do.  
Transportation professionals can have billions and billions of options, so coming up with some efficient method for mathematically searching 
through decision space using optimization 
theory is critical. 
Sometimes, scaling down the problem to make 
it easier to solve is an appropriate strategy when we develop models to predict 
performance.  
Deciding between simple representations 
using closed-form mathematical solutions or complex simulation models to generate 
answers is very important.

          <text>13Transportation systems are complex, dynamic, 
and internally interconnected as well as interconnected with other complex dynamic 
systems (e.g., the environment, the economy).
They vary in space and time (at different scales 
for different components).  Service is provided on complex networks.  The systems are 
stochastic in nature.
Human decision-makers with complex decision 
calculi make choices that shape the transportation system.
Modeling the entire system is almost unthinkable.  Our challen ge is to choose relevant 
subsystems and model them appropriately for 
the intended purpose, mindfully reflecting the 
boundary effects of the unmodeled components.

Measuring Model Success
Research View:  The ways in which 
people in practice and those in academia measure the success of 
models may differ substantially. Think 
about concepts like unique solutions and assuring that there is a strong theoretical base. 
Practice View:  Does it help me in my 
job?  Does it make me be a better Vice-President - Marketing than I was 
before I had this model?

On the institutional sphere there are 
only actors. All institutional and 
regulatory components (such as 
laws, budgets etc.) are shown in 
the physical domain. Actors on the 
institutional sphere then affect 
those components and thereby 
impact the physical system.-- This

City Megacity
Characteristics 
Checklist
1.Megacity with close to 20 million people in Mexico City 
Metropolitan Area (MCMA)
2.A combination of topography and meteorological 
conditions, together with increased auto ownership, 
producing an air quality problem of the first magnitude
3.As with many developing countries, a tremendous range 
in wealth among its citizens
4.A sprawling land use pattern fueled by both illegal 
settlements on the fringes and suburbanization and the 
resistance of central city delegacionesto densification
5.A surface transportation subject to substantial congestion 
throughout the day in some parts of the city 
exacerbating the air quality issue in the MCMA
6.The MCMA as institutionally complex, considering its 
relation to the federal government and relationship 
between the Federal District (DF) and the State of Mexico 
(EM)
7.The MCMA as the economic engine of Mexico, but 
dependent on the economic health of its neighbor to the 
north
8.Economic growth as a driving policy, with the automotive 
industry as an important part of the national economy
9.A changing political landscape in the past five years 
(since the election of President Fox in 2000, after 71 
years of presidential rule by the same party).21

/square4What is the nature of the uncertainty of the 
system?  When are the subsystems inherently 
unpredictable, and when is the uncertainty due 
to the interaction of the subsystems?  
/square4Uncertainty is everywhere -- deal with it.

/square4Mexico City provides a clear example 
of how changes in the physical 
domain can impact the types of 
policy-institutional structures that are 
needed to manage certain issues.
/square4The urbanized area has progressed 
beyond the Federal District across 
state boundaries to the State of 
Mexico, and more recently, to the 
State of Hidalgo.
/square4In this manner, the physical domain 
changes generated a tension on the 
institutional sphere, which 
necessitated new institutions at the 
metropolitan-level.

Strategic Alternatives for 
CLIOS System Improvement 
This is the creative step in 
the CLIOS Process. We are 
interested in improving the performance of our CLIOS System.
Searching the solution space
Thinking outside the box  new 
/ fresh ideas, cutting across the 
CLIOS System
But dont overlook conventional 
strategic alternatives
Be sensitive to the behavioral complexity in our CLIOS System

          <text>6DES Stage
Creative in nature  we are 
designing our CLIOS System
But we are doing so with humility, recognizing its complexity, and the challenge 
we face
Another d-word, 
discernment for more effective decision-making is a 
better term
But keep in mind, at the end of 
the day, we do have to move forward. We dont simply study 
our CLIOS System--- we 
implement bundles of strategic alternatives to improve 
performance

(DES) Stage
We have completed the 
Representation Stage and have a 
first-order understanding of our 
the CLIOS System.
We have characterized the issues we 
face.
We have identified preliminary 
goals.
We have some insight of the CLIOS 
System behavior
In the physical domain
In the institutional sphere
In the interactions between the 
two

Performance is often difficult to 
define and will vary according to the stakeholders involved
Understanding their measures 
for performance is key
Especially where 
policymakers/stakeholders 
compete for influence
