 One possible explanation [for	 universals	 i n color	 naming] is	 .	 .	 .	 the irregular	 shape of	
the color	 space.	 .	 .	 .	 Hue interacts	 with saturation and lightness	 to produce several large 
bumps ; one large bump is at focal yellow,	 and another at focal red. . . .We assume 
that	 the names	 that	 get	 assigned to the color	 space .	 .	 .	 are likely	 to be those names

          <text>Conclusions	so	far
 
 There are cross-linguistic differences in perceptual	
discrimination,	 but the discrimination process seems to
involve some language-related processing,	 because this part
of the task can be interfered with 
 Does	 l anguage affect perception? Not to a  large degree.
/Maybe
 only in	 difficult  tasks where  language  processing  might  help  
too
 Further	 tests of effects of language on  perception

 Language / words change the cognition of their speakers: they help 
their speakers accomplish difficult cognitive tasks by creating
abstractions for the efficient processing and storage of information 
 These abstractions complement rather than replace pre-existing 
non-verbal representations: when linguistic abstractions are
temporarily inaccessible, language users are able to fall back on the
representations used by other animals, children, and speakers of
languages without those abstractions.</text>

          <text>Why the wide variability among cultures?
 
Puzzles for the perceptual hypothesis
 
1. What exactly is a basic color term? Is this term well-defined? 
2. Why are there exceptions to the subset relationship (e.g., Berinmo)? 
3. Why d
o more industrialized cultures have more color words? 
Kay 
&amp; Maffi, 1999: As technology develops, the increased importance of color as a 
distinguishing property of objects appears to be an important factor in causing languages to 
add basic color terms, i.e., to refine the lexical partition of the color domain ( Casson 1997). 
If we must appeal to culture to explain color distributions anyway, maybe we can do 
away with the notion of basic color term: Maybe color terms are just experience-
based (Deutscher, 2010; cf. Gladstone, 1860) 
People with different experiences with colors and color labeling will be different at their 
ability to use color words. E.g., painters, interior designers</text>

The single-subject/single-item method
 
Weaknesses of the single-subject/single-item method 
(e.g., Schutze, 1996; Cowart, 1997;Wasow &amp; Arnold, 2005; Ferreira, 2005; Featherston, 
2007; Myers, 2009; 
Gibson &amp; Fedorenko, 2010, 2012): 
Cognitive biases on the part of the researcher and participants
The non-quantitative method presupposes that there is some categorical difference
between grammatical and ungrammatical.What if the difference is continuous, fromcompletely unacceptable to very acceptable? Using the non-quantitative method, we cant
nd probabilistic effects or relative effect sizes, or interactions among factors
Perhaps the biggest problem: without quantitative methods, if researchers make

There is evidence that the lexical decision task is affected by the context 
in important ways: instructions etc. 
For sentences, how does the context affect the judgments? 
If the distractor materials vary, does this affect the judgments in an 
interesting way?

1.The current acceptable error rate in linguistics studies is too high
2.Informal linguistic experiments (judgments) make it difcult for researchers who either are from
other elds or do not speak the target language in the materials
3.Cognitive biases: experiments are conducted using the experimenters' judgement to determinewhat is deemed correct or pref
erred or more grammatical
4.Only formal experiment can give detailed information on the size of effects in an objectivemanner

          <text>Answer to Sprouse &amp; Almeida (2012):
 
5% errors is too many errors
 
(2) A p &lt; 0.05 false-positive threshold for null h ypothesis signicance testing 
(NHST) in behavioral experiments is not comparable to a 5% false-positive rate 
in published acceptability judgments. 
The NHST paradigm assumes that one has performed statistical signicance testing for each effect; the p &lt; 0.05 threshold is an easy way to classify the results, but it does not substitute for the quantitative information. 
Furthermore a 5% error rate in linguistic acceptability judgments suggests that 5% of all judgments 
would div erge fr
om the results of a formal experiment. But there is no sampling being done; the 
method provides no quantitative information about any individual effect. 
If the average linguistics paper has thirty-three examples, divergences are uniformly distributed, and if 
the divergence rate is 5%, then e
very paper is likely to contain ~1-2 questionable judgments. 
So perhaps the biggest problem with non-quantitative methods: if researchers make any judgment 
errors, 
other researchers have no information about which comparisons are ok, and which are 
not.</text>

Furthermore, Sprouse, Schutze &amp; Almeida (2013) nd that approximately

Inquiry set, ones that SSA did not run. (12 items / comparison; 60 participants / 
expt; 2 methods: forced choice; ratings) 
Results : 11% of judgments do not show a sig. result in at least one of the two 
methods; 5% do not sho

Pre-theoretically we think that there is a lexicon, syntax (word or der/ 
composition rules)
, and the meaning associated with each. Consider making a 
comparison of sentence a vs sentence b. If we want to argue that this effect shows an effect of syntax (word order/composition rules), we need to control for other factors. That is, we need to make sure that the meaning is controlled across the two, and the words are the mostly the same, and have the same frequency (familiarity).</text>

Reasons to do quantitative research
 
 In non-quantitative work, because there are some judgment errors, 
other researchers can never know which comparisons are ok, and which 
are not. Even if we dont require arbitrarily low error rates, the details of a quantitative experiment provide some evidence about how strongly to believe the effect. Objectivity. 
 Intuitions are not reliable for interactions among factors. 
 Difcult / impossible to maintain consistency of judgments across 
many pairs of judgments. 
 Can learn about effect sizes , which can often be used to determine if 
some factor is theoretically important.</text>

Using quantitative methods would slow down research a great deal: 
It would cripple linguistic investigation if it were required that all judgments of 
ambiguity and grammaticality be subject to statistically rig or
ous experiments on 
naive subjects. (Culicover &amp; Jackendoff, 2010, p. 234).</text>

Phillips (2008) 
In order for there to be a crisis, however, it would need to be the case that
 
intuitive judgments have led to generalizations that are widely accepted yet
 bogus... Carefully controlled judgment studies would solve these problems.
 
Phillips claim: There are few enough incorrect judgments in the 
literature such that adopting quantitative standards wouldnt solve an existing 
problem.

1.	 The tested sentences in Mahowald et al were originally designed to show the same contrast as 
the original paired-data from Linguistic Inquiry
.. How were the pairs of sentences constructed by 
students in a class? 
2.	 Under many circumstances, linguists provide more than one pairs of sentences with different contrasts (independent evidence of distinct types) to support one step of their reasoning. 
In such 
cases, one pair of unreliable language data does not necessarily impair their reasoning.T o consider this factor, it might be useful to categorize the linguistic data extracted from Linguistic Inquiry into several subcategories. 
Several pairs of language data which are contributed to the same argument 
might be marked as parallel data which are separated from other language data which is the sole evidence for a certain argument. 
3.	 Bayesian statistics? Condence intervals for the SNAP judgments? Not for now 
4.	 With the SNAP judgements, I was a little bit unsure whether each decision of the 5 would have the same tw o tendencies and the test was if 5 people chose the same tendency ov er the other 
v
e times out of ve. 
5.	 potential differences between the magnitude-estimation and the rating study 
6.	 What qualitative-research approaches are commonly employed in linguistics research? 
7.	 How does this relate to other forms of linguistics research? Is the SNAP judgment paradigm only applicable to experiments inv estigating sentence acceptability?</text>

          <text>What do you want to know more about?
 
Im curious about the algebra adopted in the corpus study to calculate surprisal of each word.
 
I would like to know more concretely how the surprisal of each word was estimated in the corpus study. I would appreciate it very 
much if you could give a couple of actual examples in the class.
 
I would like elaboration on the details of the information theory involved in this and especially in other similar experiments.
 I am curious to learn more on what Shannon information content/theory.
 Does this pattern of information-theoretical optimization hold true for other languages as well as English? Is there any data o
n how
 
language evolved through time to become more efficient at communicating information?
 I want to learn more about the robustness of the negative log-probability surprisal measure and about how non-lexical, non-syntactic,
 
context-based information interacts with this word-length, information correlation.
 
Can we talk more about the statistics behind how you perform a corpus study? How exactly does an n-gram model allow you to
 
generate probabilities for not just word predictions, but also for how contextual a sentence is?
 
I would be interested in seeing other examples of questions from the behavioral study.

 
Im interested in the difference between supportive contexts and neutral contexts; more broadly, I'd love a continued exploration of

 
different areas of syntax.
 1.what's the relationship of linguistic theories and information theory?
2.As is mentioned in the last part of the paper, this research might help account for the language change where words become
shorter. I was wondering how we understand/explain the condition where the surprisal and word length increases.The results of this paper are convincing, but Im also curious about the selection of synonyms of different lengths in neutral context 
and very unsupportive context. Following the line of this research, we might predict that words of long length would be preferred in very unsupportive context. 
Im interested in learning more about other factors that cause people to chose longer words 
I would like to discuss more about the difference between written and verbal communications because there may also be dif
ferences 
in word length between these two methods of communication. Additionally , I want to know what kinds of follow up studies would be/ 
have been conducted as a result of this study; what has it led to?</text>

(thanks to Kyle Mahowald) 
from Wikipedia 
Ithkuil words can be divided into just two parts of speech , formatives and adjuncts. 
Formatives can function both as nouns and as v erbs, 
depending on the morpho -
semantic context.[8] Both nominal and verbal formatives are inected to one of the 
possible 3 stems, 3 patterns
, 2 designations (formal or informal), 9 congurations, 4 
afliations, 4 perspectives, 6 extensions, 4 contexts, 2 essences, and 96 cases; formatives 
also can take on some of the 153 afxes, which ar
e further qualied into one of 9 
degrees.V erbal f
ormatives are additionally inected for 7 illocutions and 7 conations. 
Verbal adjuncts work in conjunction with adjacent formatives to provide additional grammatical information.[9] Verbal adjuncts ar e inected to indicate 14 valencies 
, 6 
versions, 8 f
ormats, 37 derivations, 30 modalities , 4 levels, 14 validations, 9 phases, 9 
sanctions, 32 aspects ,
8 moods, and 24 biases.</text>

The fundamental problem of communication 
is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. ...The signicant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.

presence of parentheses and participants majors, influence their priming 
effect. Do you find their predictions for the effects of these factors 
natural? Are other predictions possible? If so, what would they be? 
 Nicole M :  While business/math-type majors seemed to understand and solve the 
equations without trouble, the psychology majors not only struggled to solve the 
equations but also often didn't seem to understand order of operations. 
 Sarah N :  I find the authors predictions to be natural. Because STEM and 
business majors regularly encounter (and are required to interpret) quantitative 
information, their experience and familiarity with quantitative information are 
likely to help in generating responses during the arithmetic-priming tasks. 
 Nicole O :  It also makes sense that people's majors would affect their decision in 
a similar way that expert chess players can better remember the setup of a chess 
board because they group the pieces differently in their mental representation than others would.

          <text>Discussion note : The authors discuss how various factors, such as 
presence of parentheses and participants majors, influence their priming 
effect. Do you find their predictions for the effects of these factors 
natural? Are other predictions possible? If so, what would they be? 
 Yingtong : Intuitively I find it hard to believe participants majors can influence their priming 
effect, unless psychology major students are biased in some sense 
 Zheng : it's hard for me to believe that people's major can have such a large impact on 
their cognitive performance. 
 Sarah W : I really don't find the these factors very natural. Math--especially the order of 
operations --is highly artificial and has to be explicitly learned 
 Also: why did they exclude 60% of the participants and how does that not totally invalidate t
heir claims? 
 Skylar : T he authors suggest that parentheses may increase the priming because they make it clearer and make it so that you don't need as much strategic thinking. But it seems to me 
like you could also imagine that they'd make less priming occur, because you aren't implicitly 
processing the tree structures as much, just following the parentheses. Similarly, they 
suggest that psychology majors, having been reminded of basic math, were more deliberative 
and so were less primed. But it seems quite possible to imagine the reverse overall effect; they were more deliberative, so they devoted more time and attention, increasing the 
amount of priming.

Grillo &amp; Costa (2014): the presence of a pseudo- relative

English doesnt allow PRCs, so there is a low attachment 
bias in English. 
P
rediction for English: Removing the that was from the 
RC gives the potential for a PRC interpretation, and 
therefore shifts to high attachment:

          <text>A meta-analysis of syntactic priming in 
language production 
Mahowald, James, Futrell &amp; Gibson, 2016 
 How are we doing in psycholinguistics? A 73-paper meta-analysis 
of 
syntactic priming in production 
 Basic idea: Combine 73 studies of syntactic priming into one 
big analysis. 
 Two main goals: 
 1) What have we learned? Of the many moderators of priming that 
have been proposed, which are the biggest contributors and 
how do they compare? How big is the priming effect itself? 
 2) Have we amassed a stable and consistent body of evidence? Is 
there 
publication bias?</text>

          <text>Scheepers et al. (2011): Priming RC 
attachment from arithmetic 
Odds ratio: about (.7)/(.3) / (.5):(.5) = 2.3 
Average weighted odds ratio in Mahowald et al: 1.67 
And there is a penalty of ~ 1 for Written sentence completion in 
Mahowald 
et al. 
So this effect is much too big! Almost certainly exaggerated. 
Our attempts to replicate on M Turk have all failed. We have 
only 
succeeded in replicating simple priming, DO-PO, and its a 
small effect on M Turk.</text>

 Why? Maybe people with less education are less familiar w

          <text>Language and thought 
 Language / words change the cognition of their speakers : they help 
their speakers accomplish difficult cognitive tasks by creating 
abstractions for the efficient processing and storage of information 
 These abstractions complement rather than replace pre-existing 
non
-verbal representations: when linguistic abstractions are 
temporarily inaccessible, language users are able to fall back on the 
representations used by other animals, children, and speakers of
languages without those abstractions. 
 This does not mean that one of these cognitive abilities is more 

basic or core, however. (Contrary to what some of the papers 
say.)</text>

Gordon interpreted his results as meaning that language 
constrains thought in a particular way. Can you think of 
other reasons why the Piraha might have shown these 
results ? 
Nicole M, Nicole O: (a) small N; (b) maybe the

 Sarah W; Yingtong, Clare: Pi raha participants might not 
have been used to the methods and thus performed "poorly .

          <text>Language and thought: number 
 Language / words change the cognition of their 
sp
eakers: they help their speakers accomplish difficult
cognitive tasks by creating abstractions for the efficientprocessing and storage of information 
 These abstractions complement rather than replace pre -
existing non-verbal representations: when linguistic 
a
bstractions are temporarily inaccessible, language
users are able to fall back on the representations used
by other animals, children, and speakers of languages 
without those abstractions.</text>

          <text>How can number affect fairness? 
1. Learning number may influence what distribution options 
children consider in fairness tasks. 
-
Before counting, children understand one- to-one 
correspondence very well (Izard, Streri, &amp; Spelke, 2014). And one- to-one correspondence looks like egalitarianism. 
2. Acquisition of cardinality may enable children to build more sophisticated normative theories of fairness. 
-
Some of the most influential theories about fairness are built 
on top of concepts arising from formal mathematics (e.g., 
Bentham, 1879; Mill, 1906).</text>

The number learning trajectory is probably
universal. 
The timing of this trajectory is not. 
Suggesting learning to count 
depends on universally shared systems of knowledge
and inference. 
depends on amount of data.

Whorf, 1956: We [English speakers] have the same word 
for falling snow, snow on the ground, snow packed hard 
like ice whatever the situation may be. To an Eskimo, 
this all-inclusive word would be almost unthinkable; he 
would say that falling snow, slushy snow, and so on, are 
sensuously and operationally different, different things to 
contend with; he uses different words for them and for 
other kinds of snow.

Summary of results in the literature (Frank, Fedorenko , Lai,

 Convergence of empirical results across the domains of color, number,
navigation, theory of mind, and object individuation 
 Meaningful cognitive differences have been demonstrated between people
who have words for particular concepts and those who dont, either because
their language does not encode those concepts or because they havent yet
learned the relevant words 
 The group differences disappear when the people who know the relevantwords lose access to these words (for example, when they are required to
occupy their verbal resources with interfering material)</text>

If we had only analyzed the effect of education on W as 
measured by computer tasks, the effect is statistically 
significant (=0.-034, se=0.01, t=-3.13, p=0.002), even 
though the effect of education on the card task is non -
significant (=-0.003, se =0.002, t=-1.67, p=0.10) ! 
This demonstrates that researchers who only run tasks

spurious effects. (cf. n=38, Piazza et al. 2013: Mundurucu)

Ratings (How natural / normal does this utterance sound? )
E.g., compare:
 Mary wondered who bought what.
 Mary wondered what who bought.
 Mary wondered what who bought when.
Careful about the notion of grammatical vs. ungrammatical:  is there
a binary choice? Or is it continuous?
Reading times / reaction time
Response accuracy to questions about the content of a sentence
All of these measures are noisy , probably because there are many factors
that contribute to them, and we are generally only investigating one or two
Thats why we do statistical analyses of the behavioral results: If there are
reliable differences in the measure across materials and participants, then
the factor in question may affect the dependent measure
But of course 
there can always be other confounding factors that we didn t
consider: its difficult to design good experiment s</text>

9. Information theory and sentence production (Gibson &amp; Thomas, 1999; Futrell &amp;
Levy, 2017) 
Materials like (1) are so difficult to understand that people often accept an ungrammatical 
version with the second verb phrase (VP2) omitted (2) (Gibson &amp; 
Thomas, 1999): 
(1) The apartment that the maid who the service had sent was cleaning was well decorated.
(2)
 missing VP2: The apartment that the maid who the service had sent was well decorated. 
Replication: replicate the Gibson &amp; Thomas (1999) results using acceptability judgements.
Extension: extend using the ideas from Futrell &amp; Levy (2017). 
10. Domain specificity / generality: Individual differences measures of completing
complex sentences and IQ (Gibson, Fedorenko &amp; Mahowald, 2014) 
A long-standing question in the language literature is whether or not there is a domain-specific
pool of resources just for comprehending and producing language. Gibson, Fedorenko &amp; Mahowald (2014) presented a novel paradigm for assessing linguistic working memory basedon people's ability to grammatically complete complex sentences. They showed that this measure correlates with a measure of non-verbal IQ, suggesting that there is no domain-specific pool of resources (or minimally
, that there is some overlap in the pools of resources).</text>

          <text>Noisy-Context Surprisal Account of Structural Forgetting
 
	 Probability that a context is remembered depends on 
its prior probability. 
	 Noisy-context surprisal explains the behavior of the RNN in Frank et al. (2016): the RNN is using alossily compressed / noisy representation of context. 
	 Same model that derives dependency locality effects also derives language-specic memory effects. 
	 The model has an explicit grammar (competence),but cannot apply it correctly (performance).

	 Information locality: predicts processing difculty when

	 How does this relate to dependency locality? 
	 Hypothesis: Words in syntactic dependencies have highmutual information. 
 If this is true, then we can see dependency locality
effects as a subset of information locality effects. 
	 This is true in dependency corpora.</text>

Suppose we have an increasing noise rate the longer a
word has been in memory.
When "threw" is far from "out", then it is less likely to reducethe surprisal of "out": more likely to be affected by noise.
When its closer, its more likely to be available.
Noisy-context surprisal increases when words that predicteach other are far apart.

12. Individual differences in quantier scope 
The sentence Every student didnt pass the test is ambiguous between a meaning where none of
the students passed the test, and one in which some but not all of the students passed the test.While one might think that the context could disambiguate the meaning, it appears that some peoplehave trouble overcoming a (possibly primed) meaning bias. 
Context biased to none: Six little-known singers were each getting ready to release their second 
albums. Their record labels expected that none of the unknown singers new albums would sell one 
million copies. 
As expected, every singer's album didn't sell one million copies. 
Context biased to some but not all: Three famous singers and three little-known singers were
each getting ready to release their second albums. Their record labels expected that all of the famous singers new albums would sell one million copies, but that none of unknown singers 
new 
albums would sell one million copies. As expected, every singer's album didn't sell one million copies. 
How many singers' albums sold one million copies? 1) All 2) Some 3)None

Conclusions
 
 Performance on a non-linguistic demanding task (a task assessing 
general uid intelligence) explains variance in peoples ability to 
grammatically complete syntactically complex materials. 
 In some cases language draws on highly domain-general 
resources (contra claims by Caplan &amp; Waters, 1999, that syntactic 
working memory is language-specic).</text>

11. Discourse Structure and Constraints on English Relative Clauses (Ambridge &amp;
Goldberg, 2008) 
The acceptability of certain complex relative clauses in English depends on the verbs 
present. For example, the question "What did John say that Mary stole from the store?" seems well-formed, but the questions "What did John realize that Mary stole from thestore?" and "What did John mumble that Mary stole from the store?" are typically rated as less acceptable. 
Ambridge &amp; Goldberg (2008) explore the idea that the unacceptability of the latter two
sentences arises because of constraints on discourse structure. In the acceptable sentence,the verb "say" makes it seem that the important information in the sentence is contained inthe following clause. In contrast, in the unacceptable sentences, the verbs "realized" and"mumbled" make the following clause seem like background information. They perform ratings studies showing that the degree to which verbs imply that the following clause is background information strongly predicts the acceptability of relative clauses formed from those clauses. 
While the results of this study are strong, they have not been extended to other grammatical
phenomena in English or other languages.</text>

14. Sedivy (2003) color naming 
Sedivy (2003) shows that speakers use color adjectives only when they are typically informative, and
that listeners reason on-line about speakers' intentions in using color adjectives by assuming thatspeakers are trying to be informative. Her paper shows that people use color adjectives to modify nouns referring to objects (such as "the blue cup") when the object can conceivably come in many colors, even when the color adjective is not necessary to disambiguate objects in immediate context.For objects that do not vary freely in color (such as a yellow banana), people do not use color adjectives often. On the comprehension side, in a visual world paradigm, when subjects hear theword "yellow" they are likely to look A W
AY from a yellow banana, since they do not think a speaker 
would use the color adjective for that object. Project: color labeling over M Turk. 
15. People are more rational in L2 than in L1. 
Keysar et al (2012) observed that using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. Four 
experiments show that the framing effect disappears when choices are presented in a foreign
tongue. Whereas people were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses when choices werepresented in their native tongue, they were not inuenced by this framing manipulation in a foreignlanguage. T
wo additional experiments showed that using a foreign language reduces loss aversion,
increasing the acceptance of both hypothetical and real bets with positive expected value.

13. Knowledge and Implicature: Context and the interpretation of quantiers 
Goodman &amp; Stuhlmuller (2013) observed that how one interprets some depends on the 
context. In a context where Laura has checked all vs some of the letters to her company ,
when she says some it changes the likely meaning: 
Letters to Laura's company almost always have checks inside. 
Today Laura needs to nd
out whether 3 of the letters have checks inside. Laura tells you on the phone: I have now
looked at 2 (or all 3) of the 3 letters, and given what I saw, I can tell you that some of today's letters have checks inside. 
Estimate (in percent) how likely it is that all 3 of the letters have checks inside. 
In a context where Laura has looked at all 3, then some usually means some but not all.
But if she has only looked at 2 of the 3 letters, then this means some and possibly all.

If the participant declined the bet, he or she kept the dollar and moved on to the next round. In each round, the expected value of taking the bet was $1.25. 
Results: participants who performed the task in Spanish took the

          <text>Framing Risk
 
The asymmetry exists even when the same choice is simply 
framed differently, as a gain or as a loss.  Another example , 
in terms of lives: 
People prefer to save the lives of 200 out of 600 people for sure than to tak e a chance of sa 
ving all of them or none. 
However, if the choice is framed in terms of lives lost (400 out of 600), the 
y become risk seeking (Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979). 
This effect violates normative assumptions that the willingness to accept risk should be independent of the description of a situation.</text>

Experiment 2 demonstrates that people are less reluctant to take

Experiment 3: Participants received $15 in $1 bills, to place 15 
separate bets. In each r
ound, they could either keep a dollar or 
risk losing it in an even bet that could gain them $2.50. Unlike in Experiment 2, participants kept the cash they accrued during the experiment.They performed the task either in their native tongue, English, or in a foreign language, Spanish.</text>

Another version of the trolley problem, without pushing a man 
onto the tracks: the switch version:  In this switch dilemma, the trolley is headed towards the ve men, but y
ou can switch it to another track where it would kill 
only one man. 
People are more willing to sacrice the one man by pulling the switch 
than b y pushing him off the f
ootbridge, and one of the primary reasons 
is that pulling the switch is less emotionally aversive.</text>

Trolley dilemma,footbridge version: 
One imagines standing on a footbridge overlooking a train track.A small on-coming train is about to kill ve people and the only way to stop it is to push a heavy man off the footbridge in front of the train.This will kill him, but save the ve people. 
A utilitarian analysis dictates sacricing one to save ve; but this would 
violate the mor al pr
ohibition against killing, and imagining physically 
pushing the man is emotionally difcult and therefore people routinely avoid that. 
If increased-systematicity is correct, then people would be more 
likel
y to opt for sacricing one man to save ve when dealing with 
such moral dilemmas in a second language than in their native language.</text>

2. Increased-systematicity: The broad motivation for this hypothesis is 
the possibility that a for
eign language provides a distancing mechanism that 
moves people from the immediate intuitive system to a more deliberate mode of thinking. 
Even when people fully comprehend the meaning of taboo words, reprimands, 
expressions of lo
ve, and advertisement slogans, they react to them less 
emotionally in a foreign language, as demonstrated by subjective ratings as well as electrodermal responses. This reduction in emotional response might diminish 
the inuence of affective processes and allow people to rely more on analytic 
processes when they make decisions. 
Thus the increased-systematicity account predicts that the use of a
 
 
foreign language should reduce the impact of framing on risk preferences.</text>

Gain-frame version of the problem from Experiment 1b: 
The economy is in difculty. Without a government program, 600,000 
people will lose their jobs . 
In order to save these jobs, two types of 
programs are being proposed: 
If you choose program A, 200,000 jobs will be saved. If you choose program B, there is a 33.3% chance that 600,000 jobs 
will be saved and a 66.6% c hance that no jobs will be saved.

Half the bets had high stakes (e.g., lose W119,000 or win 
W170,000), and half had low stakes (e.g., lose W200 or win W500; W1,000 is roughly equal to $1). 
People routinely show loss aversion in situations involving large 
amounts, but ther 
e is evidence that they are not loss averse in the 
case of insignicant amounts (Harinck,Van Dijk,Van Beest, &amp; Mersmann, 2007). 
Therefore, Keysar et al. expected the language in which the bets 
wer
e presented to affect decisions mainly in the case of the larger 
bets.</text>

          <text>Noisy-channel models of comprehension
 
Design:
manipulate plausibility (using role reversals)
examine interpretation
Interpretation was assessed with comprehension questions.
Examples: 
a.Sentence: The ball kicked the girl.
Question: Did the ball kick something/someone?
b.Se
ntence: The mother gave the candle the daughter.
Question: Did the daughter receiv e something/someone?
E.g., 
in (a) a yes answer indicates that the reader relied on syntax (surface
form) to interpret the sentence; a no ans
wer indicates that the reader relied
on semantics. The reverse holds for (b).

 Noisy-channel models of comprehension
 
Summary: 
Evidence for a noise model: 
1. People are more likely to infer the plausible alternative if it 
involves inf
erring fewer errors.
 
2. People are more likely to infer the plausible alternative if it is
 
one deletion away compar ed to one inser
tion.
 
3. Increasing the noise increases the reliance on plausibility. 
Evidence for priors: 1. Plausibility Prior: Increasing the likelihood of implausible events 
decreases the reliance on semantics.

          <text>Review from last time: Mahowald et al. 2013
 
Words with a long/ short form (e.g., math, mathematics) are preferred as short in a 
supportive context. 
Question: is this because of audience design: the desire to help out our 
conversation par ticipants? 
Ans
wer: its impossible to tell based purely on corpus data. 
Evidence for audience design: 
Clark (1996): Asking for directions: Speakers use words that are appropriate to 
listeners backgr ound knowledge . 
But maybe this difference reects different lexical 
knowledge? 
Wilkes-Gibbs &amp; Clark (1992): participants coordinating over names for objects of 
tangrams, moving them ar ound. 
Directors who talk to one listener rst and then 
have to describe the same tangrams to a nave listener use more words with the nave person. (Probably not an effect of lexicon.)</text>

More changes lead to a greater reliance on syntax: 
major changes (93.4%) vs. minor changes: (56.1%) Deletions are perceived to be more likely than insertions, leading to lower likelihood of literal meaning for deletions: single insertions (66.1%) vs. single deletions (46.0%)</text>

          <text>Noisy-channel models of comprehension
 
Classic assumption in sentence processing:
input to the parser is an error-free sequence of words
(e.g., Frazier &amp; Fodor, 1978; Gibson, 1991, 1998; Jurafsky, 1996; Hale, 
2001; Levy, 2008a). 
This assumption is problematic (e.g., Levy, 2008b).
Many sources of noise:
(a)perception errors (mis-hearing/mis-reading); the environment
can be noisy
(b)production errors (mis-speaking/mis-typing)
Classic issue in signal processing (e.g., Shannon, 1948)

Ambiguity is only a problem in theory
Ambiguity is not a problem in normal language use, because context disambiguates
(Wasow &amp; Arnold, 2003;Wasow et al., 2005; Jaeger, 2006; Roland, Elman, &amp; Ferreira,2006; Ferreira, 2008; Jaeger, 2010).
Piantadosi,Tily &amp; Gibson (2012):
An information-theoretic proof that efcient communication systems
will necessarily be globally ambiguous when context is informativeabout meaning
ambiguity potentially allows for re-use of easy linguistic elements:
John wanted to run.
John went to school.
John wanted two dollars.
Sam wanted some money too.</text>

Testing the predictions: syntactic alternations:
More changes leads to lower likelihood of inferring the 
alternative (cf. MacWhinney &amp; Bates, 1989; Ferreira, 2003)
 
Minor change alternations: 
PO-goal DO-goal (1 deletion): 
The mother gave the candle to the daughter. The mother gave the candle the daughter. 
DO-goal  PO-goal (1 insertion): 
The mother gave the daughter the candle. The mother gave the daughter to the candle. 
Major change alternations: 
Passive Active (2 deletions): 
The ball was kicked by the girl. The ball kic k ed the girl. 
Active  Passive (2 insertions): 
The girl kicked the ball. The girl was kicked by the ball.</text>

More controversial than some might think...
The natural approach has always been: Is it well designed
for use, under stood typically as use f
or communication? I
think thats the wrong question. The use of language forcommunication might turn out to be a kind ofepiphenomenon. ... If you want to make sure that we never
misunderstand one another, for that purpose language is
not well designed, because you have such properties as
ambiguity. If we want to have the property that the thingsthat we usually would like to say come out short and simple,
well, it probably doesnt have that property. (Chomsky,
2002, p. 107)

          <text>Agreement errors: the result of noisy-channel
 
in comprehension? (Bergen &amp; Gibson, 2012)
 
Our claim:
Agreement errors result from rational misidentification of the preamble.
The asymmetry between singular and plural head-nouns is
explained by 2 factors:
Deletions are much more likely than insertions (Gibson et al, 2013). Thus
agreement errors will occur more often when the head noun is singular.
Prior distribution of NP sequences: the singular-singular is much the most commonsequence. Thus there will be few errors confusing sing-sing as plural-sing.
Plural-head/Singular-local	 The keys to the cabinet
Given the plural head noun, it is unlikely that the comprehender will infer that the plural-marking 
was produced by mistake, so unlikely to be pulled to the sing-sing. 
Singular-head/Plural-local	 The key to the cabinets ...
Given the singular head noun, it is possible that the compr ehender will think that the pr

A classic nding in the sentence production literature (Bock &amp; Miller, 1991)

Agreement error asymmetry:

One syntactic island for extraction that was discovered by Ross (1967) was the 
NP-island constraint, whereby it doesnt sound good to have a wh-question out of an NP . For example, while its ok to extract out of an embedded clause as in (1), its not so good when the embedding is part of a noun phrase: 
(1) What vegetable did the reporter believe that the president disliked? 
(2) ?* What vegetable did the reporter believe the fact that the president disliked? 
It is thought that relative clauses such as in (3) have a similar structure as wh -
questions: (3) The vegetable that the president dislikes is broccoli. 
Provide evidence from your judgments of relative clauses that suggests a similar 
island eff ect in r
elative clauses as in (1) vs (2), and therefore a similar structure in 
relative clauses as in wh-questions.</text>

Core assumptions of the resource-limitation theory (Kluender &amp; Kutas 1993)
 
COMPONENT 1:There is a processing cost associated with the operations
 necessary to build long-distance WH-dependencies.
 COMPONENT 2:There is a processing cost associated with the operations
 necessary to build the syntactic structures that we call island structures.
 LINKING HYPOTHESIS: Processing costs are reected in acceptability 
judgments such that higher costs lead to lower acceptability.
 
SIMULTANEITY:These two (sets of) processes must be deployed simultaneously 
in sentences that giv e rise to island eff
ects.
 
LIMITED CAPACITY:There is a limited pool of processing resources available 
that must be shared by all simultaneous processes.
 OVERLOAD:Additional unacceptability arises if the simultaneous processes
 necessary to complete the parse require more resources than are available in

12. Individual differences in quantier scope 
The sentence Every student didnt pass the test is ambiguous between a meaning where none of
the students passed the test, and one in which some but not all of the students passed the test.While one might think that the context could disambiguate the meaning, it appears that some peoplehave trouble overcoming a (possibly primed) meaning bias. 
Context biased to none: 
Six little-known singers were each getting ready to release their second 
albums. Their record labels expected that none of the unknown singers 
new albums would sell one 
million copies. As expected, every singer's album didn't sell one million copies. 
Context biased to some but not all: Three famous singers and three little-known singers were
each getting ready to release their second albums. Their record labels expected that all of the 
famous singers 
new albums would sell one million copies, but that none of unknown singers new 
albums would sell one million copies. As expected, every singer's album didn't sell one million copies. 
How many singers' albums sold one million copies? 1) All 2) Some 3)None

14. Sedivy (2003) color naming 
Sedivy (2003) shows that speakers use color adjectives only when they are typically informative, and
that listeners reason on-line about speakers' intentions in using color adjectives by assuming thatspeakers are trying to be informative. Her paper shows that people use color adjectives to modify nouns referring to objects (such as "the blue cup") when the object can conceivably come in many colors, even when the color adjective is not necessary to disambiguate objects in immediate context.For objects that do not vary freely in color (such as a yellow banana), people do not use color adjectives often. On the comprehension side, in a visual world paradigm, when subjects hear theword "yellow" they are likely to look A
WAY from a yellow banana, since they do not think a speaker 
would use the color adjective for that object. Project: color labeling over M Turk. 
15. People are more rational in L2 than in L1. 
Keysar et al (2012) observed that using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. Four 
experiments show that the framing ef fect disappears when choices are presented in a foreign
tongue. Whereas people were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses when choices were
presented in their native tongue, they were not inuenced by this framing manipulation in a foreignlanguage. 
Two additional experiments showed that using a foreign language reduces loss aversion,
increasing the acceptance of both hypothetical and real bets with positive expected value.

(1) Mary saw the report that was about Bill. 
(2)  (negation) Mary didnt see the report that was about Bill. 
If the meaning of a negative form of S doesnt negate the meaning of E 
then E is not the main assertion: its presupposed or backgrounded 
The meaning of the RC in (2) is still the report that was about Bill (not the 
repor
t that wasnt about Bill) 
Therefore, a relative clause (RC) is backgrounded information. Then maybe extraction fr
om backgrounded information is disallowed:

Chomsky, 1986; Chomsky, 1995): 
No rule may move a phrase from position Y to position X (or conversely) in: 
. . . X . . . [ A . . . [ B . . .Y . . .] . . . ] . . . X . . .

13. Knowledge and Implicature: Context and the interpretation of quantiers 
Goodman &amp; Stuhlmuller (2013) observed that how one interprets some depends on the 
context. In a context where Laura has checked all vs some of the letters to her company
,
when she says some it changes the likely meaning: 
Letters to Laura's company almost always have checks inside. Today Laura needs to nd
out whether 3 of the letters have checks inside. Laura tells you on the phone: I have nowlooked at 2 (or all 3) of the 3 letters, and given what I saw , I can tell you that some of today's 
letters have checks inside. 
Estimate (in percent) how likely it is that all 3 of the letters have checks inside. 
In a context where Laura has looked at all 3, then some usually means some but not all.
But if she has only looked at 2 of the 3 letters, then this means some and possibly all. 
Replicate this, and extend it in some interesting way

11. Discourse Structure and Constraints on English Relative Clauses (Ambridge &amp;
Goldberg, 2008) 
The acceptability of certain complex relative clauses in English depends on the verbs 
present. For example, the question "What did John say that Mary stole from the store?" seems well-formed, but the questions "What did John realize that Mary stole from thestore?" and "What did John mumble that Mary stole from the store?" are typically rated as less acceptable. 
Ambridge &amp; Goldberg (2008) explore the idea that the unacceptability of the latter two
sentences arises because of constraints on discourse structure. In the acceptable sentence,the verb "say" makes it seem that the important information in the sentence is contained inthe following clause. In contrast, in the unacceptable sentences, the verbs "realized" and"mumbled" make the following clause seem like background information. They perform ratings studies showing that the degree to which verbs imply that the following clause is background information strongly predicts the acceptability of relative clauses formed from those clauses. 
While the results of this study are strong, they have not been extended to other grammatical
phenomena in English or other languages.</text>

Result: No correlation whatsoever. 
We believe that the results of the experiments presented in this article provide strong 
suppor t f
or grammatical theories of island effects because we can nd no evidence of a 
relationship between processing resource capacity and island effects. 
BUT: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
 
Null correlation: how to interpret?
Would w

ratings and participant height? Probably not.

Our claim: 
Agreement errors result from rational misidentification of the preamble. 
The asymmetry between singular and plural head-nouns is
explained by 2 factors:
Deletions are much more likely than insertions (Gibson et al, 2013). Thus
agreement errors will occur more often when the head noun is singular.
Prior distribution of NP sequences: the singular-singular is much the most commonsequence. Thus there will be few errors confusing sing-sing as plural-sing.
Plural-head/Singular-local The keys to the cabinet
Given the plural head noun, it is unlikely that the comprehender will infer that the plural-marking 
was produced by mistake, so unlikely to be pulled to the sing-sing. Singular-head/Plural-local The key to the cabinets ...

Old observation: aphasics comprehension relies more on world knowledge 
than non-brain-damaged controls. (e.g., Caramazza &amp; Zurif, 1976) 
Hypothesis: Aphasics perception is noisier than that of healthy individuals.
In maximizing P(s i | s p), aphasics will rely more on their prior distribution P(s i) 
over plausibly intended sentences. 
(Gibson, Sandberg, Fedorenko, Bergen &amp; Kiran, 2015, J of Aphasiolo gy)

similar phrases that could have easily generated them. People will follow this incorrect interpretation, and be confused later when it turns out to be wrong.

3.Information theory: word length (Mahowald et al. 2013)
Mahowald et al. 2013 compared meaning-matched word pairs like chimp/chimpanzee and
found that a more supportive sentence context is more predictive of the shorter form. This result holds in both a corpus analysis using Google n-grams and a behavioral experiment onT
urk in which people were asked to choose either the long or short form of a word. This is 
consistent with the ndings of Piantadosi et al. (2011), who found that, consistent with predictions from information theory, surprisal in context was a better predictor of word length than frequency. 
4.Information theory: optional elements in the syntax (Jaeger, 2010)
Jaeger (2010) did corpus analyses, showing that people tend to produce the optional
complementizer "that" in environments with high surprisal (e.g., following a verb like "saw,which often takes an NP complement but rarely takes an S complement), and they tend to omit "that" in environments with low surprisal (e.g., following a verb like "know, which oftentakes an S complement but rarely takes an NP
 complement ). 
Project: replicate this effect in acceptability ratings over materials where the verb subcategorization frequencies are varied from an S being highly expected, to an S beingmuch less expected.</text>

errors (Bergen &amp; Gibson, 2012) 
These experiments argue for a rational inference account 
(cf. traditional views, i.e., syntactic planning or memory retrieval). 
Advantages of the rational inference account:
1.A principled explanation of the sing-plural / plural-sing asymmetry.2.Repetition errors pattern with typical agreement errors.
3.A unitary explanation for three additional aspects of the data:
Additional head-number cues decrease the error rate.
Increasing the presentation time decreases the error rate.
Increasing the base rate of singular-singular NP-P-NPs decreases the
err

 Noisy-channel models of comprehension 
Summary: 
Evidence for a noise model: 
1.People are more likely to infer the plausible alternative if it 
inv
olves inferring fewer errors. 
2.People are more likely to infer the plausible alternative if it is
one deletion awa
y compared to one insertion.
3.Increasing the noise increases the reliance on plausibility. 
Evidence for priors: 1.Plausibility Prior: Increasing the likelihood of implausible events
decreases the r
eliance on semantics.

The no-recursion claim is Dans hypothesis, and he may have 
unconscious cognitive biases in support of this hypothesis (cf. 
Gibson &amp; Fedorenko, 2010, 2012)
 Many key examples are ambiguous with respect to their 
syntactic analysis
 Lack of examples may result from low frequency  
structures (rather than ungrammaticality)</text>

Pirah  has a number of very surprising features: 
the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept 
of counting and of any terms for quantification, 
the absence of color terms, the absence of syntactic embedding in the 
language, 
the simplest pronoun inventory known, 
the absence of relative tenses, the simplest kinship system yet documented, 
the absence of creation myths and fiction, 
the absence of any individual or collective memory of 
more than two generations past, 
the absence of drawing or other art , 
one of the simplest material cultures documented, 
the Pirah  are monolingual after more than 200 years 
of regular contact.</text>

1.The term Uni versal Grammar (UG):
(a)Chomsky (in more recent discussions of Everetts work)
and 
Nevins et al. assume that UG is whatever is biologically
necessary to learn human language.
(b)Everett uses the term to refer to a specific claim about the
nat
ure of human language from HCF: that it allows recursion
(self-embedding) in the syntax
It makes no sense to falsify UG in the sense of (a): this is
just 
a descriptive term

Everett (2005) argued that the grammar of
Pirah
, an isolate language spoken by a
small hunter-gatherer community in the
Amazonian rain forest, is not recursive . (cf.
Hale, 1976)
Pirah is proposed to have a regular
grammar , 
generating a finite language (with
no recursive rules)</text>

General Caveat:
Everetts descriptive hypothesis is that Pirah lacks
re
cursion
In general, it is impossible to prove a negative claim: if
recursi

evidence of them

2.The definition of recursion :
(a)self-embedding of a syntactic category, thus allowing for an infinite
number of sentences (Everett, 2005).
(b)Merge: effectively compositionality of any two syntactic elements
(Nevins, Pesetsky &amp; Rodrigues, 2009):
'In a model with category-neutral Merge, however, a language that lacks
recu
rsion would be considerably more exotic. No sentence in such a language
could contain more than two words. Pirah is manifestly not such a language. 
(p. 366) 
Using definition (b), there is no debate (as Nevins et al. observe)
Everett is assuming definition (a).
An alternative response to Everett could have been: recursion is available to all 
languages, but not all languages use it. This is Jackendof
fs response. He 
accepts that self-embedding may not be part of many grammars.</text>

structures
2.Syntactic explanatory: Immediacy of Experience
Prin
ciple : Pirah culture constrains communication
to non -abstract subjects which fall within the

The analysis of these clauses as embedded or matrix clauses is underdetermined by the 
evidence: There is no convincing argument yet to analyze these clauses as embedded.

Quantity- 2: Do n t make your contribution more informative than is
required for the purposes of the present exchange.
.The hearer notes that the speaker chose a modified form rather thanan unm

When do people compute contrast sets associated with referring  
expressions? Test cases:

(1)Maxim of Quantity:
Make your contribution as informative as is required
Do not make your contribution more informative than is required
In a context where all of the students passed the test.  
Some of the students passed the test.
In a context with only one cup: 
Pass me the cup. 
?? Pass me the tall  blue cup thats made out of plastic.
(2)Maxim of Quality:
Do not say that which you believe to be false
Do not say that for which you lack evidence
(3)Maxim of Relation:
Say only what is relevant for the current purposes of the conversation.
(4)Maxim of Manner:
Be brief but avoid ambiguity or obscurity of expression.</text>

the simp l
e, default form to refer to an entity.  The inclusion of the 
modifier is most easily made informative by attributing to it adistinguishing function. 
(1)Neo-Gricean View (Conservative)
Early 
contrastive -infere nces are only sensitive to whether or not the
speaker elaborates on a default form. (cf. Levinson, 2000)
 The baseline is the default form: the way that people would describe 
the situation with no contrasting information.</text>

As long as the speaker adheres to the cooperative

intentionally.
Deliberate violation of a maxim can give rise to an

          <text>Tests of the theories 
 Testing the form-based account: The contrast effect should 
disappear if a non-scalar adjective is used. E.g., a color 
adjective, or a material adjective. 
 Colors: pick up th e blue cup, with a blue and red cup in the 
display. (as well as a competitor blue object, in order to control
for the fact that people are incremental in their eye-gazes.) 
 Results from colors: 
The contrast effect disappears! 
 Is this support for the form-based account?
Yes, but there is an alternative Gricean account.</text>

(2) Form-B ased Account (Semantic account: literal meaning) 
Contrastive inference is closely tied to conventional meaning of 
restrictively modified NPs or to the lexical class of the modifier.
Scalar adjectives contain a variable assigned by a contextually
 
relevant comparison class (S eigel, 1 980; Bierwisch, 1 987)

(1)Maxim of Quantity:
Make your contribution as informative as is required
Do not make your contribution more informative than is required
In a conte xt wher e all of the student s passe d the test. 
?? Some of the students passed the test. 
In a context with only one cup: 
Pass me the cup. 
?? Pass me the tall  blue cup thats made out of plastic.
(2) 	Maxim of Quality: e.g., when your friend Paul has betrayed you in some way: Paul
is a 
fine friend 
Do not say that which you believe to be false
Do not say that for which you lack evidence
(3)Maxim of Relation:
Say only what is relevant for the current purposes of the conversation.
(4)Maxim of Manner:
Be brief but avoid ambiguity or obscurity of expression.</text>

          <text>Grices Maxims 
As long as the speaker adheres to the cooperative
princi
ple, he/she can disobey the maxims
intentionally.
Deliberate violation of a maxim can give rise to an
implicatu
re. 
Implicature: exploiting the cooperative principle to convey 
more information than is actually contained in 
an utterance. 
Hyperbole, sarcasm, understatement are all violations of Quality m

Conclusion: Plausibility and lexical frequency are
used as soon as can be measured in resolving 
ambiguity in on-line sentence processing. 
This is evidence against the syntax -fir st
modularity hypot he sis:
