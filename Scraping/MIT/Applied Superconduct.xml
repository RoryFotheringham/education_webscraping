The energy stored in the slab is 
For each slab and the total 
inductance per unit length is twice 
this. This is the 
Dispersionless Transmission Lines 
Because Lo and Co do not depend on frequency 
for a superconductor, th e phase velocity is 
independent of frequency. So that a pulse will 
propagate down a superconducting transmission 
line without dispersi ng. Also, the amount of 
attenuation is extremely sm all, since this is due 
to Ro. 
For a normal metal, Lodepends on frequency so 
that there is dispersion, in addition to a much 
greater loss.

Quantum Computing 
Qubits are two level systems 
a) Spin states can be true two level systems, or 
b) Any two quantum energy levels can also be used 
0 We will call the lowe r energy state and the 
higher energy state 1 
In general, the wave function can be in a superposition 
of these two states 
= a 0 + b 1

1.	The conduction electrons are modeled as a gas of 
particles with no coulom b repulsion (screening)
2.	Independent Electron Approximation 
	The response to applied fields is calculated for 
each electron separately. 
	The total response is th e sum of the individual 
responses. 
3.	Electrons undergo collisions which randomize 
their velocities.
4.	Electrons are in thermal equilibrium with the 
lattice.

Ginzburg-Landau Expansion 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
6.763 2005 Lecture 18 Ginzburg-Landau Theory focuses on the Free  Energy Difference between two phases 
It assumes that one phase is related to another by a small parameter which changes 
continuously near the transition from one phase to another. 
Lets recall the free energy difference be tween the superconducting and normal phases 
Assume the free energy of the phase A evolves from the normal state at no field as a 
power series in the density  of superconducting electrons:

The Normal State
If the electrons in both the superconducting and the normal state are described by 
quantum mechanics, what is the wavefunction for the normal state and how does it 
differ from the superconducting state? 
Quantum Mechanics describes both states as a wavefunction that depends on the 
coordinates of all the electrons. 
The  MQM wavefunction for the superconductor is the spatial average of this phase 
coherent wavefunction and is preserved with an applied field. The coherence persists 
over the macroscopic scale of the superconductor. 
In the normal state, the applied field causes dissipation; this energy loss causes the 
phase of the wavefunction is randomized, on  a length scale which is usually much 
smaller than the scale of the material. 
The electrons is the normal state have a background speed, the fermi velocity vF. The 
electrons undergo collis ions on a time scale tr. The average distance between 
collisions is the mean free path,

For the simply connected region, fluxoid quantization holds for every contour C, no

For the mutiply connected region, the contour  can only be shrink to the contour outlining the normal region.  Hence, the integrals need not vanish, so  n can be any integer.

For an isolated system in equilibrium S = 0
The first law for thermodynamics for a system in equilib rium can be written as

Recent Advances in Superconductivity 
call for papers for 2006 MRS meeting 
High-temperature superconductors have b een featured at MR S meetings since 
their discovery in 1986. Twenty years later, the progr ess both on the fundamental 
understanding of these materials and the path towards their industr ial applications has 
been impressive. First-generation wires are now routinely produced in kilometer 
lengths and used in a variety of large- scale prototypes of  practical devices , while the 
scale-up of second-generation wires (RE 123-based coated conductors) for industrial 
manufacturing is progressing at a fast p ace. These achievements have been made 
possible by cutting-edge developments in materials science and technology. Coated 
conductors are composites of na noscale layers of various materials and functionalities; 
and the understanding of issues concerning te xtured templates, complex oxide epitaxy, 
interfacial reactions, metal-oxide interfaces, crystal chemistry, defect characterization, 
and diffusion barriers is essential for the op timization of their properties. A topic of 
present large interest is the improvement of th e in-field critical current by introduction of 
appropriate vortex pinning cent ers. It is now clear that large improvements can be 
obtained through the nano-engineering of several types of defects . As the technology 
approaches maturity, new problems such as ac losses and thermal stabilization will 
become increasingly important. Superconducting MgB2 also attracts large interest 
due to its high-transition temperature (highest among binary compounds), chemical 
simplicity, low cost of the raw materials, and absence of weak-link limitations that 
allows the use of mature powder-in-tube technology to fabricate long wires. The 
inclusion of MgB2 presentations in the sy mposium will bring together both communities 
and will encourage the discussion of pr oblems that are common to all superconducting 
wires. &lt; http://www.mrs.org/meetings/s pring2006/program/s06_cfp_hh.html&gt;

Our goal is to show that the 
DC SQUID circuit in (a) is 
equivalent to the circuit for 
a single junction with an 
effective I and an effective c 
resistance.  The inductance 
of the SQUID loop in (a) is 
considered negligible. 
In fact, we will also show 
later that there is an 
equivalent statement even 
for the underdamped cass.

Why Method II 
Question:
The constitutive relations and Londons Equations have 
gotten much more difficult. So why do Method II?
Answer: 
The Energy and Thermodynamics are easier, especially 
when there is no applied current.
So we will find the ener gy stored in both methods. 
Poyntings theorem is a result of Maxwells equation, so both methods give

Because the supercurrent equation does not hold 
in the insulating region, the full macroscopic wave 
equation must be used to find Y in the insulating 
region, with the boundary conditions given by the 
wavefunction at the electrodes.

A dc voltage of 10 V causes an oscillation frequency of about 5 GHz, a 
Josephson microwave oscillator.  But with a typical I of 1 mA, this 
oscillator delivers a very small power of the order of 10 nW. Therefore need 
many synchronous oscillators.

Principle of the DC Voltage Standard
v(t) + -
An ac voltage of  1 GHz applied across the junction will gi ve a dc current, at 
V0= 0 and at dc voltages of integral multiples of 2 V. 
The principle of the dc Volt: Put 5000 Josephson junctions in series, and apply 
a fixed frequency, which can be done very accurately, and measure the interval 
of the resulting dc voltages that occur at precise voltage intervals.
