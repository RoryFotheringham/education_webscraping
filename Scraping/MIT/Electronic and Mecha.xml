          <text>Mobility in Free-Electron Theory
Between collisions with the latti ce atoms, each electron experiences 
a force from the electric field given by F = -eE 
and therefore an acceleration given by a = F/m = -eE/m 
Theory assumes that the energy picked up from the electric field 
by the electron between collisions is delivered to the lattice 
in each collision, so acceleration must start again.

If the average time between collisions is , the average velocity is

* These are roughly the limiting values assumed by R n as the field becomes 
very large (of order 104 G), and the temperature very low, in carefully 
prepared specimens. The data are quoted in the form n 0:n. Where n 0 is the 
density for which the Drude form (1.21) agrees with the measured 
Ru:n0 = -1/RHec. Evidently the alkali metals obey the Drude result 
reasonably well, the noble metals (Cu. Ag, Au) less well, and the remaining entries, not at all.

	For hydrogenic donors or acceptors, we can think of the electron or hole, 
respectively, as an orbiting electron around a net fixed charge 
	We can estimate the energy to free th e carrier into the conduction band or 
valence band by using a modified expression for the energy of an electron in 
the H atom

Since the probability of the carrier transition is ~e-E/kT, trapping a carrier with a deep state is 
very probable 
A trapped carrier can then help attract anothe r carrier, increasing recombination through the

	Instead of tracking electrons in valence ba nd, more convenient to track vacancies of

	Also removes problem with negative electron ma ss: since hole ener gy increases as holes 
sink, the mass of  the hole is positive as long as it has a positive charge 
	Both carrier s at the band edge can be thought of as classical free carriers like the Drude

          <text>Origin of Polarization
	We are interested in the true dipoles creating polarization in materials (not 
surface effect) 
	As with the free electrons, what is the response of these various dipole 
mechanisms to various E-field frequencies? 
	When do we have to worry about controlling 
	molecular polarization (molecule may have non-uniform electron density) 
	ionic polarization (E-field may distort i on positions and temporarily create dipoles) 
	electronic polarization (bound electrons ar ound ion cores could distort and lead to 
polarization) 
	Except for the electronic polarization, we  might expect the other mechanisms 
to operate at lower frequencies, since the units are much more massive 
	What are the applications that use wave s in materials for frequencies below the 
visible?
