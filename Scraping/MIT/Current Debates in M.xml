          <text>ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY 
 
There is a causal relationship 
between pornography and male 
violence against women  
Pornography is violence against 
women 
Women enjoying pornography are 
conditioned to see gender 
inequalities as sexy  
Pornography should be eradicated 
or censored 
 
 ANTI-CENSORSHIP 
 
There is no direct link between 
pornography and male violence 
against women  
Representations of rape or 
murder cannot be considered 
as real rape or real murder  
The problem of violence in 
pornography is exaggerated 
We should acknowledge the 
agency of female performers, 
mens responsibility for their 
actions and the complex 
pleasure that pornography can 
provide

rarely pointed out while the gender of female abusers is often 
emphasized and their femininity put into question

problematized or stigmatized

          <text>Socialization  
Facebook generates a new mode of narrative 
performance that differs from Goffmans  
conception of social performances in many ways: 
 
Users can see their own performance mirror 
back at them and edit it 
Performances are subjected to an open-ended 
process of resignification   
Some people may only observe performances without reciprocating

          <text>Identity 
Early studies on MMORPGs  conceive avatars mostly as 
representations of the player in the game environment. 
 
Gee conceives customized avatar as a projective 
identity: the type of person that the player wants his 
avatar to become. (in Waggoner, 2009: 15)  
 
Trpanier believes that the avatar is performative: it 
constructs the identity of the player that it is supposed 
to represent. (2012: 150)  
 
Taylor believes that avatars alter our phenomenal body.

bureaucratisation of social ties  
Interpreting signs provided by the online 
context   
presenting themselves and performing their 
social role online

          <text>Friendship 
Criterion #3: Revelation of intimate details 
  
Friendship is a private emotionally 
expressive bound that is precious in the 
context of globalization (Giddens, 1991). 
 
Friendship is a relation constructed around 
intimate disclosure and a safe haven against 
competitiveness in our urban and industrialized societies (Jamieson,1998).

          <text>Friendship 
Criterion #3: Revelation of intimate details 
 
In the context of social networks, friendship 
should be redefined outside of its bound to 
privacy  
Friendship has not always been bound to privacy throughout history 
For Aristotle, friendship is public and political, 
because it cements civic order and society

          <text>Socialization  
Social Performance: individuals who present 
themselves to others tend to incorporate and 
exemplify the officially accredited values of the 
society. (Goffman, 1959: 35) 
 
Different social contexts require that we perform 
different roles (Front regions = decorum / Back 
regions = step out of character) (Goffman , 1959)

Facebook as a technique of the self

Hupomnemata : a notebook used by Ancient 
Greeks not to reveal the hidden or the 
unsaid, but on the contrary to capture the 
already said, to collect what one has managed 
to hear or read, and for a purpose that is nothing less than the shaping of the self (Foucault, Ethics: 210-211).

          <text>Friendship 
Criterion #4: Physical Proximity 
 
Physical presence and non-verbal communication 
are replaced by chat, emotes, avatar gestures that 
signal online presence and communicate feelings 
Online interactions are as real as physical 
interactions since they generate tangible emotions   
In MMORPGs , physical proximity is not a condition 
to establish a friendship, but the possible 
consequence of online friendship

They also tend to ignore that: 
 
Different Facebook users are negotiating 
disclosure of information differently  
In social networks, participation requires 
constant self-presentation  
Contemporary American culture blurred the 
boundaries between private and public life before the advent of social networks (with reality 
shows, talk shows, TV doctors)

Widespread conception: offline world

Criterion #3: Revelation of intimate details 
  
The opposition between intimacy and public 
life is a false dichotomy 
The existence of social networks proves the 
possibility of public intimacy

Identity 
ifferences between a hupomnemata and a 
acebook page: 
People are not the only author of their 
Facebook page  
People can easily compare their Facebook 
page with those of others  
Facebook is a rigid platform structured by 
capitalist interests and social norms

          <text>Identity 
Traditional definition : set of characteristics 
which allows the sameness, coherence and 
continuity of a person over time (static) 
 
Poststructuralist definition: social constructionthat constantly evolves over the course of new 
life experiences and under the influence of 
social norms that people interiorize and negotiate (fluid)

          <text>Privacy and Surveillance  
Privacy is defined in the legal domain as: 
 
the right to protect our domestic sphere from the 
state and the media intrusion, as well as the right to 
control access to our personal information (Lambert, 
2013: 29)  
 
The perception of what is private and public depends of 
the cultural context : 
 
Something considered public in relation to one realm 
may be private in relation to another depending on 
the norms of appropriateness ( Nissenbaum in 
Lambert, 2013:  36)

          <text>Narcissism  
They tend to ignore that: 
 
Many users are annoyed by trivial or overly 
emotional posts  
Norms of self-disclosure are more permissive on 
Facebook.  
What is culturally appropriated in terms of public 
self-disclosure keeps changing  
Users are constantly negotiating this evolving 
social contract by controlling the flow of 
information

          <text>Socialization  
They finally tend to ignore that: 
 
Not all users willingly accept the gaze of 
invisible Facebook users  
Failure to capture the attention of a Facebook 
audience can be felt as a lack of social 
recognition 
In our capitalist societies, the boundaries between subjects and objects are already blurred (self-branding)

 Embodiment  
nline embodiment is however different than
ace- to-face embodiment:  
While the presence of a physical body is 
experienced as constant, presence on 
Facebook must be continually reaffirmed  
(Lambert, 2013)  
Avatars presence is more unstable than 
offline presence because of glitches and ghost state (Taylor, 2002: 41)

The members of a thinking community search, inscribe,

materialized in an immense multidimensional electronic 
image, perpetually metamorphosing, [] Not only does the 
cosmopedia make available to the collective intellect all the 
pertinent knowledge available to it at a given moment, but it 
also serves as a site of collective discussion, negotiation, and 
development. [] hierarchies between users and designers, 
authors and readers, are inverted. A person who decides to 
learn about a topic [] will be capable of supplying new 
information about a given sector [] in which he or she 
happens to specialize.

          <text>Lvys  Cosmopedia  
 
In contrast to the expanding complexity that we attempt 
to organize through transcendence or distribute within 
increasingly inextricable networks, the cosmopedia 
provides a new kind of simplicity. [] It is through the 
simplicity of our immersion that we escape its complexity, 
its labyrinthine networks. Once within, the member of 
the collective intellect swims around (navigates, consults, 
questions, inscribes, etc.), then leaves. [] Each one helps 
build and order a space of shared signification by diving 
in, swimming around, and simply living in it.

Collective intelligence can be harmful to some 
people  (stalking , erroneous information, etc.)  
 
Collective intelligence does not necessarily lead 
to the end of expertise (formation of brain 
trusts, secret clubs, and hierarchies)  
 
Knowledge  communities do not have to be 
horizontal and leaderless (brain trusts protect 
privacy and ensure a higher degree of accuracy )

          <text>1)William: There is more than one ideology in a society. The dominance of some 
ideologies is determined by who controls the process of incorporation, that is to say 
the selection of ideas that are  valued and the interpretation of dissident  ideas as 
deviances. 
 
2)Gramsci: The ruling class cannot achieve dominance and hegemony only through 
coercion (police, laws, army). Rulers also have to win the consent of subordinate 
classes through ideologies and achieve a complex alliance of class fracti
ons.  
 
       Hegemony is not given and permanent: it can be lost and h as to be constantly
secured with the preservation of an unstable equilibrium. The ruling class has
to make concessions to win consent and  legitimacy.  
 
       Dissident ideas are easily contained when opposing groups are not organized and
strong enough  to act as a counter-hegemonic forces and intervene in the
process of  incorporation. 
 
3) Althusser: U
nlike coercive states, the ideological state apparatuses rule by 
reproducing the ideology of the ruling class, which is not simple and unified, but a 
complex set of contradictory ideas that reflect class struggles.

          <text>According to Marx, the type of collaboration that humans favor to 
appropriate nature and produce material goods shapes a 
society/cultures ideologies, discourses, knowledge and institutions. 
 
 In return, these ideologies, discourses, knowledge, and institutions 
sustain this society/cultures mode of production.  
 
 In a capitalist system, this collaboration and mode of production 
revolve around the exploitation of the working class by the ruling 
class within specific historical conditions.

          <text>The ruling class does not exert control over society directly, but 
through the civil societys market ideology, as well as through the 
states ideologies of justice, democracy, and freedom, which all 
operate through three mechanisms: 
 
 fragmenting 
 uniting 
 masking 
 
These ideologies legitimate the hegemony of the ruling class and

          <text>In the context of monopoly capitalism, mass media become the main producers and 
distributers of culture, as well as the most influential ideological apparatus.  
 
 The state and the ruling class do not control the media directly, but rather through dominant 
ideologies . This allows media to gain legitimacy. 
 
 The broadcasting principles of objectivity and neutrality encourage encoders to present 
different ideas, opinions,  practices, and lifestyles.  
 
 However, encoders internalize dominant ideologies and unconsciously select, rank, and 
interpret these different ideas as either as permitted and meaningful or as deviant and 
meaningless. 
 
 Encoders also present these different ideas, opinions, practices and lifestyles as part of a 
coherent society that makes room for minorities and in which different opinions can be 
debated. This produces the illusion of a consensus that has been  reached rationally.  
 
 Decoders are free to negotiate the meanings of mass media messages and interpret them in 
counter-hegemonic ways, but they are strongly encouraged, by visual and verbal 
techniques, to interpret mass media messages within the limits of dominant ideologies .  
 
 Moreover, the possibility of negotiating meanings legitimizes mass media by producing the 
illusion of a consensus that has been reached rationally.

1.the tautological one : computer literacy is the ability to use 
computers 
2.the idealistic one : shorthand for cultural ideals ranging from 
economic development, to personal fulfillment and moral strength 
3.the widely adopted one : ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and 
create messages in a variety of forms (skills-based approach)

          <text>For local issues, media are ignoring polls that show 
opposition to issues on which major investors in political 
parties agree. Media coverage is often hostile to protesters 
(use of words such as all -purpose agitators, 
troublemakers), while downplaying the police provocation 
and violence (use of chemical weapons and rubber bullets).

          <text>TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT 
  
Empiricist (business):  
 
Big data can speak for themselves without the need of theories, models or 
hypothesis (fallacious) 
Big data analytics are free of human bias. They can be interpreted by 
anyone and their meanings transcend contexts (fallacious ) 
 
Data-driven science (academia)   
 
Use of existing theories and concepts to analyze the datasets  
Use of big data to identify good questions and formulate hypothesis 
Use of datasets for answering questions that these datasets were not designed to answer (problem)

        <slide>
          <slideno>18</slideno>
          <text>Potential solutions (Bollier, 2010):  
 
erasing data after a given period of time 
giving to people the right to take possession of their data  
limiting data collection to what is needed  
favouring self-discipline by introducing new social norms  
gaming the system by voluntarily altering our behavior 
(Nissenbaum )  
being proactive

          <text>Potential solutions: 
 
shifting from privacy by consent to privacy by 
accountability   
defining new regulations (government or market?) 
redefining the notion of justice to preserve human agency 
opening the access to datasets and algorithms (transparency) 
mandating impartial experts to certify the algorithms and the interpretations  
blurring datasets (differential privacy) 
specifying how people can disprove a prediction about them

          <text>Advantages of big data compared to traditional scientific 
methods: 
 
reduces the risk of error and bias associated with 
sampling (but can also face problems) 
provides the opportunity to create more dynamic and 
sophisticated model s (but does not offer certainties) 
helps finding correlations that no theory can identify 
(but can lead to serious fallacies) 
allows to consider data once perceived as noise

          <text>Paradigm shift   Big data requires researchers to:  
 
deal with the abundance and embrace messiness  
conduct research with no precise question in mind  
gain insights from data (induction) instead of testing 
theories by analyzing data (deduction)  
use hundreds of algorithms instead of selecting one 
stop obsessing with causality and be satisfied with 
correlations
