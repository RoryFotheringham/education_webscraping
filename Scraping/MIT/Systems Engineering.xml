Generate multiple solutions to same problem spec.
Depict the solutions (sketches)
Form the matrix
Choose criteria (and clarify them)
Choose datum (pick one of the best solutions)
Insert comparisons (+, S, -), form sums thereof
Look at strongest concepts, try to reverse 
negatives (combine with complementary concepts)
Look at weaker concepts, try to improve them

          <text>Arrows Impossibility Theorem
Given the choice between x, yand z, a group 
preference should satisfy conditions:
If everyone in the group prefers xover y, the group preference 
should be for xover y
If the group preference is for xover yand for yover z, then the 
group preference should be for xover z
If the group must choose between xand y, their preference 
should not depend upon whether zexists or not
There shouldnt be a dictator in  the group, i.e., the preferences 
of each indiv idual in the group should count
Arrows Impossibility Theorem: no method of 
preference aggregation meets these conditions

QFD helps with the front 
end
Then a large number of 
concepts are needed
Pugh controlled 
convergence helps with the 
convergent and divergent 
process
Enhances creativity, 
communication, and builds 
consensus
Dont over emphasize

          <text>Preliminary Feedback on Exam #1
Most people seem to be doing very well
Some people seemed to run into a time 
crunch (my theory is that #1 + open book 
caused the time problem)
I will do my best to account for the time 
issue in final grading, but I do suggest 
preparing differently for the next exam
There were a few points I obviously should 
have emphasized more clearly</text>

How is kaizen related to flow? (HP video)
If a design has more DPs than FRs it is a 
______ design and the extra DP 
contributes needlessly to ________.
A decoupled design must have its DPs set 
in a _______________.

better yet, maintain a clear view.</text>

Summary
can break down functional barriers and 
encourage teamwork 
The house relives no one of the responsibility 
of making the tough decisions
Many of the most effective companies use QFD
Surveys suggest that QFD provides long term 
competitive advantages

          <text>What is the Pugh Matrix for?
The Pugh matrix is for
Structuring and representing an 
evaluation procedure 
Serves as common visual
Provides a discipline
Helps break down self-sealing 
behavior
Encourages real teamwork
Convergence
Eliminates weaker ideas
Retains a set of strong concepts
Divergence
Helps to identify opportunities 
for combinationThe Pugh matrix is NOT for
Automatic decision making
the scores or numbers  are for 
guidance only and must not be 
summed algebraically.
it avoids the rigidity and false 
confidence of rating/weighting 
matrices
Completely controlling the 
process
 stimulates creative 
unconstrained thinking due to its 
lack of rigorous structure

          <text>What is the QFD for?
QFD is for
Coordinating skills within an 
organization 
Serves as a lingua franca
Helps break down the functional 
silos
Encourages real teamwork
Designing goods that customers 
want to purchase
Creates external focus
Provides immersion in the 
specifications
Target setting for mature 
produc tsQFD is NOT for
Automatic decision making
the house absolves no one of 
the responsibility of making 
tough decisions 
Implementing a quick fix
None of this is simple
An elegant idea ultimately 
decays into process
What is also not simple is 
creating an organization capable 
of absorbing elegant ideas
More difficult to use for highly 
novel / unprecedented functions

The process of devising a system, 
component, or process to meet desired 
needs.  It is a decision-making process 
(often iterative) in which the basic 
sciences, mathematics, and engineering 
sciences are applied to convert resources 
optimally to meet a stated objective

Expectations
ESD.33 is a 12 unit subject (3-0-9)
The units correspond to the time that an 
adequately prepared student with good study 
habits is expected to spend in a normal week  
However, the summer term is compressed from 
a regular academic year term as there are 10 
weeks as compared to 14 during a regular term.  
Thus, the weekly time commitment is 16.8 hrs .  
The out of class time will roughly be split 
between reading assignments and homework.</text>

Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary 
approach and means to enable the 
realization of successful systems. It 
focuses on defining customer needs and 
required functionality early in the 
development cycle, documenting 
requirements, then proceeding with design 
synthesis and system validation while

Concept, form, function, decomposition 
Systems Engineering (ESD.33) is about the 
PROCESSES that enable successful 
implementation of the architecture 
QFD, Pugh Concept Selection, Robust Design,  
System Project Management (ESD.36) is about

You stated during the lecture that the order of 
the Control Factors on slide 20 made a 
difference and that this would result in 
different tests being conducted. I agree with 
that. ... What is the approach for deciding 
which permutation of the balanced orthogonal 
array to test or does it matter? would the 
Factor Effect Plots generated as per slide 24 
show the same information, i.e., identify those 
factors that generate the most improvement 
independent of which orthogonal array you 
ran for a given set of factors?</text>

In my experience, the main problem is the 
tendency to regard the spec (tolerance 
based) as the benchmark for all design 
decisions. We even have trouble 
convincing the company to allow us to 
perform robustness testsGo fix the spec 
and stop asking for expensive and time 
consuming robustness tests we are told.  
robustness is a design property that we 
should care about rather than just meeting 
the spec. Is this an appropriate way to view 
the issue?</text>

          <text>A Comparison of Taguchi's Product 
Array and the Combined Array in 
Robust Parameter Design
We have run an experiment where we have done 
both designs simultaneously ( product and 
combined ). In our experiment, we found that the 
product array performed better for the 
identification of effects on the variance. An 
explanation for this might be that the combined 
array relies too much on the factor sparsity
assumption.

Single arrays achieve improved run size economy (or 
provide advantages in resolving selected effects)
Selection guided by effect ordering principle
those with a larger number of clear control-by-noise 
interactions, clear control main effects, clear noise main 
effects, and clear control-by-control interactions are 
judged to be good arrays.
Some of the single arrays  are uniformly better than 
corresponding cross arrays in terms of the number of 
clear main effects and two factor interactions

          <text>Increasing Degree of Ideality
Functionality
Costs+ ProblemsDegree of Ideality =
Costs = $, size, weight, part count, etc.
In the course of evolution, degree of ideality
of technological systems increases.
Systems with higher degree of ideality have 
much better chances to survive the long-run 
market selection process, i.e., to dominate the  
market.
Analysis of the histor y of techn ology led Altsh ullerto the disc overy and form ulatio n of the primar y law of evolutio n of technol ogical systems theLaw of Increasing D egree of 
Ideality . 
Degre e of Idea lity is defined as a ratio of Index of F unction alityto Index of Cost , where cost can be e xpressed in d ollars, or un its of size or weight, etc. It is, 
essentia lly, the  Benefit-to-Cos tratio. A truly  ideal s ystem in most cases is a virtual rea lity,it exists onl y in our imagi natio n. This means that in the proc ess of evolutio n either the 
system perfor ming certai n functions bec omes less complic ated/costly , or it becomes ca pable of perform ing its function s better o rperforms more fun ctions. A combi nation of 
these evol ution ary processes also often occu rs.

Infancy Maturity Rapid growth
July 2004 MIT 7Typical steps o f evolution of te chnol ogical systems can be ill ustrated b y an S-shape d curv e that reflects chang es of the s ystem 's benefit-to cost ratio w ith time since  the inceptio n 
of the s ystem. In the infanc y phase the s ystems devel opme nt is relativel y slow. The next phase is ch aracterized b y fast develo pment, usual ly attribut ed to commerc ialization of 
the s ystem an d perfecting of the manufactur ing process es. Then the systems evoluti on is eventual ly slowing down and stalls or even  starts degradi ng.  These seg ments of the 
system life cur ve are t ypical for its old age. In some cases th esystem u ndergoes "renaissance ", which can be spark ed by availability of new materials, of new manufacturing 
technol ogy, and/or b y development of ne w applicatio ns. W hen t he pres ent system is a pproachi ng the e nd phas e of its devel opme nt, usual ly a new system having a higher 
performanc e potential is a lready waiting in th e wings.  
On the other hand, some s ystems are deteri orating. An e xample is turntab les for LP record s, which are s upplanted b y CD systems, although some b asic 
models of the turntabl es are s till in pro ductio n.
The length and  slope of each segment on th e life curve of the s ystem d epends, of cours e, not onl y on technic al but al so on econ omic and on hum an 
psychological inertia factors.  W hile the common sense (i n the hinds ight!) suggests th at a new system s hould start its fast dev elopment when dev elopment of the present s ystem 
starts to slo w down, freque ntly it is dela yed by spec ial interest groups, which have lar ge in vestments, job securit y, etc., ass ociated with the old s ystem.</text>

I wanted to comment on the CFM56 vs Whittle engine.  
The CFM56 engine is an example of the system 
engineering aspects of organizations and their 
architecture/structure and how they relate to the 
partitioning of the engine itself.  The engine being built 
by CFMI, which is a consortium of GE, SNECMA and 
Hispano-Suiza.  No single player builds the entire engine 
 Whittle had his fairly small shop with a collection of 
machinists and his lab - all probably within his domain 
and span of control.  
One of the other greatly complicating factors of the 
CFM56 vs. Whittle engine are all of the secondary power 
extractions that are powered from today's engines, which 
have an enormous impact on the engine's performance
SyEmakes this possible today; whereas Whittle was 
focused on a revolutionary powerplant for propulsion.</text>

          <text>Questions to Probe Chapter 2
According to INCOSE:
When did SE emerge as a separate 
branch of engineering?
What are some of the key functions of SE?
Who should carry out the SE function?
What fraction of the program budget 
should be spent on SE?
Do SE methods apply to smaller 
systems?

Axiomatic design can lead to a rational design     
-Suh, Axiomatic Design Theory for Systems
In order to ensure that engineering design is 
conducted as a rational process

          <text>What is Rationality?
Theoretical rationality applies to beliefs  e.g. 
beliefs that are self evident or derived from self 
evident beliefs by a reliable procedure
Another account of rational action is ... to act 
rationally is to act on universalizable principles, 
so that what is a reason for one person must be 
a reason for everyone 
Practical rationality applies to actionsacting 
rationally simply means acting in a way that is 
maximally efficient in achieving ones goals

Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering
The essence of a software entity is a 
construct of interlocking concepts
I believe the hard part of building software 
to be the specification, design, and testing 
of this conceptual construct
If this is true, building software will always 
be hard</text>

          <text>My Conclusions
Uncoupled or decoupled alternatives are not 
always available
Coupled designs can be executed successfully
Simulation is helps us execute coupled designs
Suhs Conclusions
If a design is coupled, FRs can only be satisfied 
when there is a unique solution
If a fully coupled design is acceptable, it is 
equivalent to having only one independent FR
FRsare defined as the minimum set of 
independent requirements</text>

Arrows theorem implies that 
irrationality is practically assured
a customer-centered view of design is not 
possible
The majority of methods in common use in 
engineering design provide results that are 
egregiously in error

A general theory for system design is presented
The theory is applicable to  large systems, 
software systems, organizations
The flow diagram  can be used for many 
different tasks: design, construction, operation, 
modification,  maintenance  diagnosis , and 
for archival documentation.
Design axioms were found to improve all designs 
without exceptions or counter-examples When 
counter-examples or exceptions are proposed, the 
author always found flaws in the arguments.</text>

We present here  axioms and  theorems that underlie 
the mathematics of design
substantially different from  conventional  eng design
imposes severe conditions on upon design methodologies
all other measures are wrong
apply to  all fields of engineering  all products, 
processes, and services, and also for the management of 
engineering design, and the integration of engineering 
design with  the entire product life cycle 
without the axiomatic framework  there will be an 
attendant loss .. typically a factor of two or more in the

          <text>Utility and Choice
Some common misperceptions about 
utility are:
The test of utilities is to see if they result 
in reasonable choices .  It is common for 
engineers to test utility functions by 
examination of the resonableness of 
choices.  The reality is that utilities need to 
be tested against preferences, not 
choices.</text>

Consequences of Coupling
.. when several functional requirements must be 
satisfied, designers must develop designs that 
have a diagonal or triangular matrix
For a product to be manufacturable, the design 
matrix of a product, [A]  times the design 
matrix for the manufacturing process, [B]  
must yield either a diagonal or triangular matrix.  
Consequently, when  either [A] or [B] 
represents a coupled design , the product cannot 
be manufactured . Theorem 9 (Design for

Conclusions
The information content of decoupled 
designs can sometimes be significantly 
different from the sum of information of 
the FRs
These differences can sometimes 
critically affect engineering decision

In some cases, the Information Axiom

          <text>George Box on Sequential 
Experimentation
Because results are usually known quickly, the natural 
way to experiment is to use information from each group of 
runs to plan the next 
Statistical training unduly emphasizes mathematics at 
the expense of science.   This has resulted in undue 
emphasis on one-shot statistical procedures  examples

          <text>Conclusions
Factorial design of experiments may not be 
best for all engineering scenarios
Adaptive one-factor-at-a-time may provide 
more improvement
When you must use very few experiments AND
EITHER Interactions are &gt;25% of factori al effects
OR
Pure experimental error is 40% or less of factorial 
effects
One-at-a-time designs exploit some 
interactions (on average) even though it cant 
resolve them
There may be human factors to consider too</text>

          <text>Statistics and Probability
Probability theory is axiomatic.  Fully defined 
probability problems have unique and precise 
solutions  
The field of statistics is different.  Statistics is 
concerned with the relation of such models to 
actual physical systems.  The methods 
employed by the statistician are arbitrary 
ways of being reasonable in the application of 
probability theory to physical situations.

1. The Printer spreads a layer of powder from the feed box 
to cover the surface of the build piston.
2. The Printer then prints binder solution onto the loose 
powder.
3. When the cross-section is complete, the build piston is 
lowered slightly, and a new layer of powder is spread 
over its surface. 
4. The process is repeated until the build is complete. 
5. The build piston is raised and the loose powder is 
vacuumed away, revealing the completed part.</text>

          <text>The factorial design is ideally suited for 
experiments whose purpose is to map a 
function in a pre-assigned range.
however, the factorial design has certain 
deficiencies         It devotes observations to 
exploring regions that may be of no interest.
These deficiencies of the factorial design 
suggest that an efficient design for the present 
purpose ought to be sequential; that is, ought 
to adjust the experimental program at each 
stage in light of the results of prior stages.

of the science of experimentation in this century 
is as the final demise of the one factor at a

there are still organizations which have never 
heard of factorial experimentation and use up 
many man hours wandering a crooked path.

~1950 a study at the London School of Hygiene 
states that smoking is an important cause of 
lung cancer because the chest X-rays of 
smokers exhibit signs of cancer at a higher 
frequency than those of non-smokers
Sir R. A. Fisher wrote 
an error has been made of an old kind, in arguing 
from correlation to causation 
For my part, I think it is more likely that a common 
cause supplies the explanation
Argued against issuance of a public health warning

          <text>Conclusions
Factorial design of experiments may not be 
best for all engineering scenarios
Adaptive one-factor-at-a-time may provide 
more improvement
When you must use very few experiments AND
EITHER Interactions are &gt;25% of factori al effects
OR
Pure experimental error is 40% or less of factorial 
effects
One-at-a-time designs exploit some 
interactions (on average) even though it cant 
resolve them
There may be human factors to consider too</text>

          <text>The factorial design is ideally suited for 
experiments whose purpose is to map a 
function in a pre-assigned range.
however, the factorial design has certain 
deficiencies         It devotes observations to 
exploring regions that may be of no interest.
These deficiencies of the factorial design 
suggest that an efficient design for the present 
purpose ought to be sequential; that is, ought 
to adjust the experimental program at each 
stage in light of the results of prior stages.

          <text>One way of thinking of the great advances 
of the science of experimentation in this century 
is as the final demise of the one factor at a 
time method , although it should be said that 
there are still organizations which have never 
heard of factorial experimentation and use up 
many man hours wandering a crooked path.

is the mechanisms that humans,

denominator is that decisions need to

QFD is for
Coordinating skills within an

Serves as a lingua franca
Helps break down the functional 
silos
Encourages real teamwork
Designing goods that customers 
want to purchase
Creates external focus
Provides immersion in the 
specifications
Target setting for mature

Automatic decision making
the house absolves no one of 
the responsibility of making 
tough decisions 
Implementing a quick fix
None of this is simple
An elegant idea ultimately 
decays into process
What is also not simple is 
creating an organization capable 
of absorbing elegant ideas
More difficult to use for highly 
novel / unprecedented functions

Consumer reports suggests that a

model six months ago and just

          <text>One Reason Decision Making
The Take The Best heuristic equals or 
outperforms any linear decision strategy when 
information is noncompensatory, that is, when 
the potential contribution of each new cue falls 
off rapidly so that combinations of later cues 
cannot outweigh earlier ones (Martignon &amp; 
Hoffrage,1999).
Such environments seem fairly commonplace, at 
least in an approximately noncompensatory
form.</text>

          <text>Follow-up on Session #4
Stephen Friedenthal --Intuitively it seems rational that 
the best decision making process is coherently logical.
However, if I take it as an axiom that I can never have 
perfect information this leads to the implication that a 
perfectly rational and logical decision making process 
can lead to a faulty conclusion
But, by the same logic this implies that if your logic is

Stephen Friedenthal --Intuitively it seems rational that 
the best decision making process is coherently logical.
However, if I take it as an axiom that I can never have 
perfect information this leads to the implication that a 
perfectly rational and logical decision making process 
can lead to a faulty conclusion
But, by the same logic this implies that if your logic is 
flawed you may or may not get the wrong answer 
So, does this imply that it can be advantageous not to be 
a rational decision maker  or, is there a flaw in this 
train of thought?No, sometimes they are just heuristic
Right!!
Yes, there is growing, empirical evidence 
that it is advantageous to be irrational in a 
strictly formal sense and instead to be 
ecologically rational</text>

Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary 
approach and means to enable the 
realization of successful systems. It 
focuses on defining customer needs and

          <text>What is Rationality?
Theoretical rationality applies to beliefs  e.g. 
beliefs that are self evident or derived from self 
evident beliefs by a reliable procedure
Another account of rational action is ... to act 
rationally is to act on universalizable principles, 
so that what is a reason for one person must be 
a reason for everyone 
Practical rationality applies to actionsacting 
rationally simply means acting in a way that is 
maximally efficient in achieving ones goals

Shashi Kant --My belief is that XP is a 
very interesting concept and should be 
covered - at least superficially. It would 
help to have an idea of such a process 
even in a highly structured development 
processes like  in the defense or 
aerospace industries. So my vote would 
be to at least touch on the subject,  I think 
even non-software people would find it

Summary
Mathematical modeling is an essential part of 
modern systems engineering
Models have many pitfalls
Most of the pitfalls get worse as systems grow 
in complexity and performance
Strategies
Know the limits of your models
Make estimates of your uncertainty
Know the effect uncertainty on your decisions 
In critical areas, develop validated models
Combine models with experimentation</text>

There is a fundamental difference between 
models used in science and engineering 
Science uses models to gain an

Engineering uses models  in an attempt 
to achieve what ought to be  The 
validated models of science are used in 
engineering  to establish bounds and to 
improve products

n is the number of variables in the problem
O(f(n)) means that as n , the execution time 
tis at most cf(n) for some constant c. 
Since only the growth rate matters, we can 
ignore the multiplicative constants and the lower 
order terms, e.g.,
 3nlog(n)+6n+2.7 is O(nlog(n))
 n3+ 10000000000n is O(n3)

Atish Banergee 
We first studied S-curves in technology strategyThe 
question remained why the S-curve has the peculiar 
shape. Well I found the answer in system dynamics. It is a 
general phenomenon and not restricted to technology.
It can be thought of as two curves:
1. The lower part of the curve is growth with 
acceleration....
2. The upper part of the s-curve is called a goal-seeking 
curve and can be thought of as growth with deceleration</text>
