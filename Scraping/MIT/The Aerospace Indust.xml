	Can you identify any Lean Thinking IOS in the 
following areas of MIT? 
	Aero-Astro department curriculum 
	MIT curriculum outside of AA 
	Student life and living 
	Administrative support systems for students
 If Yes: What are they? What is preventing them 
from growing into Mainlands of Success?
	If No: What are some opportunities for starting 
some IOS? How could they be started?</text>

The US Government should give higher 
priority to R&amp;D investment in Zero Point 
Energy than scramjet propulsion .
Pros
Applications are much 
larger for ZPE
More stakehol ders
Auto, space,
New energy source to wean 
us from fossil fuelsCons
Looking at applied science for 
scramjets vs science fiction for 
ZPE
Wide variety of applications
Military, commercial
SSTO
Challenge is engineering 
complexity. Does not need 
new physics like ZPE

objectives and missions
Not human rat ed
If industry goes up, NASA 
priorities go down
If industry goes down, 
NASA looses launch
Loose internal compet ency
What does NASA becomeP ros
Less time to launch with more 
providers
More options
Spread liability
Better wages, better engineers
Leaner, no bureaucracy
More stable industry

          <text>Value Proposition for Human Space Exploration - II
 Student replies - Prof Hastings assessment
Better processes for overall systems integration -
definitely will do this, but it is not unique. Large 
defense systems, etc.
Capability to colonize other planets to avoid 
following dinosaurs to extinction - would have to 
sell to Congress. Statistics may not support this 
when re-election is near.
Better safety standards for aerospace and other 
fields - will there be spillover to other fields
Scientific gains: geology, fuel - geology is 
unknown. Fuel has some merit in Helium 3. No 
radioactive waste. But no working fusion reactor.</text>

 Student replies - Prof Hastings assessment
Social aspect having humans involved. Achieve what sci-fi 
has indicated
National pride - Pride is important. Countries invest in 
national pride projects. China is a current example. But 
does this lead you to human space flight. Going to Mars 
could win the argument. How much are you willing to 
pay? Would human space flight be more compelling than 
something else?
Commercial benefits - ?? -Trap. It has not yet succeeded 
with human space flight. What commercial things have 
come so far from humans in space? The Tang effect.
Educational stimulation - Yes, but why not invest directly 
in schools.</text>

          <text>Value Proposition for Human Space Exploration - I
 Student replies - Prof Hastings assessment
Value of science delivered will be superior to 
robotics - maybe.
Future of engineering and science - invest in NSF
Spinoffs -medical, velcro effect - relies on 
serendipity. Maybe.
Bolster space access launch market - not enough 
launches to be a driver.
Human experience from those who were there -
does it inspire John Q Public? Astronauts are 
motivational. But it is worth the investment?
Maintaining human space flight - tautology</text>

National pride in the context of Cold War
Technological presentation seen as surrogate for 
national power
Order $50B spent
This country spend a couple trillion dollars over 
40 years on nuclear weapons
Key value was deterrence against a monolithic enemy
Pres. Bush asked for $87B for Iraq

          <text>Value Proposition for Human Space Exploration - III
 Student replies - Prof Hastings assessment
Technology development and research will 
contribute value - serendipity argument. Why 
human space flight? Why not energy initiative?
Not so much the end goal, but value delivered along the 
way
Useful by a large subset of the population
Possible moon/mars colonization/bases -
tautological .
If you dont care about the end goal, why not just 
fund research? Human spaceflight will generate 
new ideas that werent even considered before hand. 
-Yes, but does it satisfy a value expectations.</text>

          <text>Dialog with Prof. Hastings - II
What would drive people and Congress to be 
willing to invest the level of funding needed for 
human space flight.
Need something to form a consensus.
If over 20 years, the AvWeek funds would 
accumulate to $500B.
But can it be sustained over that period of time
Nuclear weapons was the only program sustained over 
this long period of time
Even Apollo was not sustained.
Need an underlying driver</text>

Pros: Great program
Change to a new set of 
standards, but cant have a 
gap in capabil ity.
Cheaper to do it now rather 
than later
Can move specialized 
functionalities from individual 
units to central units
Information will have many 
users (govt agencies).
Uniform protocols will gi ve 
integrated seamless system
New technologies with 
improved capabilityCons
Upfront costs
Realignment of training, etc.
Upper mgmt turnover
Limits flexibility for future
Could stifle innovation
Will funding stability de-
incentive team
What will happen in the

Bought insurance for both sat and launcher
For Iridium, had deductible for 2-3 failures
Cant insure business plan
For one time launch would not go with 
untried launch system
But for multiple launch, would buy a 
portion of launches once it was proven.</text>

Reliability and putting eggs in one basket.
Would take out some bad aspects like multiple 
protocols
Balance long term strategy vs short term pain.
Space architects need to make some tough choices.
Need to fundamentally rethink how systems work 
today.
TC is a way to get us to focus on SoS approach.
How can one make a network that doesnt go 
down with failure of one component?
Network architecture can be more robust.</text>

 .Cons
Could increase 
workload (student and

Lean Enterprise Value addresses the right questions 
and should catalyze thoughts from leaders both in 
government and in industry as to how lean can create 
sustainable value, attracting valued human and financial 
resources and thus re-ignite Aerospaces ability to 
inspire.  Aerospace is a pioneering sector the 
challenge is to direct its vast resourcefulness in ways 
that translate into value metrics relevant to this 
generation (for both scientists and investors) and thus 
securing its health into the next century.</text>

 Kaizen versus re-engineering 
 Pro: In general, for large-scale lean implementation initiatives, 
the incremental, bottom-up kaiz en approach will be the most 
effective 
 Con: In general, for large-scale lean implementation initiatives, 
the revolutionary, top-down re-engineering approach will be the 
most effective

Top-Down Re-engineering Bottom-up Kaizen 
 Many meanings: 
 Range from a pretext for
restructuring and downsizing to
a systematic review of
operations with comprehensiveprocess mapping 
 Key quote: 
 if its not broke, break it  Many meanings: 
 Range from suggestion systems(kaizen-teian) to an underlying 
philosophy and a way of life 
 Key quote: 
 many small improvements build   
long-term transformation capability 
 Roots: 
 Roots in private and publicsectors, including re-inventing
government 
 First driven by economic crisis in 1980s, now seen as a
process for system change  Roots: 
 Post WWII Japan, beginning withquality circles (QC), statistical
process control (SPC), and just-in-
time (JIT) delivery practices 
 Increasingly seen from a systemsperspective -- Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma,
Lean Enterprise 
 Archetypical Example:

Notes from Student Responses
Re-Engineering Kaizen 
 Top-down sets a strong foundation so  Elimination of typical top-down 
you can make faster change communications problems
 A clearer focus, unlike bottom-up time  Quicker because directly involves the 
on minor details worker
 Top-down will get change done  Increased self-esteem
 Address all at once, so faster	 Spiral development with feedback 
Rebuttal Rebuttal
 Harder to integrate lower level  that is  You said it was stronger foundation, but 
why you need top management	not true  keep destroying the 
foundation
 Doing the job right or  doing the right job  One system with constant improvement
 Not just the easy changes first  A better focus
 Dont get overall benefits 	 Employees are the ones driving this Just islands of success  What if you go fast and mess up?
 May not be enough time  Top management is needed for
integration
 If isnt not broken, keep on improving

- Journals in this seminar are not the free-writing you may have  practiced in high 
school nor are they particularly self-re flective although that may come into it. 
 
- Instead we are practicing journal skills as a way to expand your abilities to think 
critically.  As youve heard the faculty say, much of professional life is making 
decisions based on good critical thinking. 
 
- Your syllabus packet has a list of prompt s that you might use if you get writers 
block when you are responding to an ar ticle or chapter.  There are other 
questions to ask, of course, but these are some basic ones.   
 
- Critical thinking prompts fall into basic categories:   
 
o What are the facts I know? 
o Can I explain this? Do I understand it? 
o Can I use it? Apply it?  
o Do I understand the key parts of this idea? This situation? 
o Can I take different ideas and put them  together in something coherent or 
in a new way? 
o Can I evaluate something or someon e or myself based on standards or 
criteria? 
 
- Were going to do some active lear ning to start to use these ideas. 
- For example, 
o Who knows the story Jack and the Beanst alk? In most versions of this 
fairy tale,  
 Jack and his mom are very poor.  
 Jacks mom tells him to sell th e cow because they are out of 
money. 
 Instead, Jack trades the cow for some beans. 
 When his mom is frustrated and throws the beans out of the 
window, the beans grow into a stalk. 
 Jack climbs the stalk into the giants home where the giant is 
sleeping. 
 Jack steals the giants gold and also takes a hen. 
 The hen squawks and wakes the giant who chases Jack down the 
beanstalk. The giant falls and is killed. 
 Jack and his mom live happily because they have money now. 
 
Please note that weve enumerated the facts we know and analyzed the fairy tale into its key parts.   But lets go further.  If Jack disobeye d his mom, made a bad business decision, 
was guilty of breaking and entering, of gree d, of theft of money and property, and</text>

          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>of contributing to death of a giant who r eally wasnt bothering him, then why is 
the giant always the bad guy?   In other words, what kind of story would it be if we thought about this 
differently?   We would use our skills of comprehensi on.  Wed be synthesizing those key parts 
of the story differently, and wed be ev aluating them against different criteria
not the fairy tale criteria but  more contemporary standards. 
 This is a lighthearted ac tive learning exercise, bu t you can apply those same 
critical thinking skills to current  events in the aerospace industry.</text>
