Leadership Reflections from Prior Classes
I did not approach LGO as an opportunity to learn 
leadership.  In fact I explicitly decided that I was not going 
to work on leadership while in the program.  I was in the 
camp of leadership cant be learned, I assumed I had 
enough experience, and I didnt see a lot of relevance to 
my learning objectives.  This was a terrible perspective for 
me to take The frameworks that I now have at my 
disposal, the action skills I have developed, the reflection 
that this time has afforded and the guidance through this 
process that the leadership curriculum has provided has 
made me a better human.  I will draw from this experience 
for the rest of my life.</text>

&gt; Do not simply apply your existing frameworks &amp; 
overlay them on the situation
&gt; Move beyond stereotypes
&gt; Learn from small experiments
&gt; Use images, metaphors, or stories to try to 
capture &amp; communicate critical elements of your 
map&gt; Understand the perspective of others within the 
organization &amp; withhold judgment while listening 
to them
&gt; Encourage others to voice their opinions
&gt; Be clear about your stand and how you 
reached it
&gt; Think about how others might react to your 
idea &amp; how you might best explain it to them
&gt; Think about your connections
&gt; Develop a vision about something that excites 
you or that you think is important
&gt; Frame the vision with an ideological goal
&gt; Use stories, metaphors and analogies to paint 
a vivid picture of what the vision will accomplish
&gt; Practice creating a vision in many arenas
&gt; Enable co -workers by pointing out that they 
have the skills &amp; capabilities needed to realize 
the vision
&gt; Embody the key values &amp; ideas contained in 
the vision walk the talk&gt; Maintain focus on improving the ways that 
people work together in your team/organization

think through how it will get done who will do

Leadership Reflections from Prior Classes
In the past, I believed that some people were natural 
leaders and others were not.  LGO taught me that 
leadership is not that different from any other skill; 
you have to practice to get better.  This sounds so 
simplistic, but the idea of actively trying to improve 
my leadership skills instead of just hoping that they 
improved on their own over time was actually a new 
idea to me.</text>

Im very conscious of the fact that you 
cant do it alone.  Its teamwork.  When 
you do it alone you run the risk that when 
you are no longer there nobody else will 
do it.

1.The introduction of new ideas/concepts occurs within the 
context of the organizations existing culture.
2.Cultural transformation may be needed to institutionalize 
new ideas, but the existing culture is the reality.
3.Successful leaders leverage the existing culture to 
change the culture.

          <text>What I Wish I had Done (Alumni 02 -04)
If I have one recommendation, it would be to somehow force people to 
get more involved... while the class work is indeed important, I felt they 
missed out on some greater learnings, including a lot of networking 
practice. (2002)
I wish that we would have had a chance to really, I mean really, give each 
other some tough feedback we need to discuss the un -mentionables 
with each other -things that are not polite or easy to discuss, but which 
could pose serious threats to our careers and leadership abilities.  These 
include work habits, language, style, technical skills, etc.  We need to 
discover and understand our weaknesses in the relatively safe 
environment of LGO so that we can have time to work on them. (2003)
LGO is a essentially a risk -free environment for learning more about one's 
leadership style, and I didn't take advantage of the opportunities available 
(including seeking active feedback from my peers). (2004)</text>

          <text>Transitions To New Teams
Consider how your new teams will be different in 
composition, purpose, context!
You will be the lone LGO on an MBA team in OP, 
Communications, Team Project, First Year Challenge, etc.
Are MBAs similar to or different from LGOs?
They may expect you to be the expert summer at MIT, 
engineer, etc.
They may think you are pampered with tuition breaks, cushy 
offices, etc.
In what ways do you want to be special or one of them?  
What do you want from them?  To give them?</text>

Flipchart to share ( no powerpoint !):
What do I want to carry forward to new teams (e.g., in 
the Fall)?  What will I practice, improve, master, become 
an artist at?
What do I want to leave behind?  What will I (or my 
teammates) get rid of, notrepeat?
Teams will report back for 3 min. each ( MAX! )</text>

          <text>Feedback from LRC Observers
The groups that were the most successful in completing the LRC tasks 
on-time, were the groups that had one or more stand -out (autocratic) 
leaders.  Interestingly, sometimes a stand -out leader was not the 
appointed leader for the iteration. Often, these stand -out leaders were 
able to assimilate the observations, warnings, and suggestions from the 
individuals in the team, then make a firm decision on a single course of 
action, and focus the teams energy on completing the task through that 
one course of action. Once the team got moving, these leaders also 
provided distraction management to keep the team focused, made 
consecutive decisions as more information about the problem was 
discovered, and consistently communicated guidance to the rest of the 
team so that each individual knew his or her role in the solution.
Conversely, teams who did not complete the tasks on -time seemed to not 
have one or more of these stand -out leaders. Often, they would expend 
75% of their allotted time in formulating a solution to the LRC task, leaving 
very little time to make actual progress in applying the solution.</text>

          <text>What I Wish I had Done (Alumni 91 -01)
In the last 11 years I've really come to appreciate that having a better 
understanding of myself is key to being a leader. (1993)
I think I was too caught up in doing coursework related activities 
(projects, homework, thesis, etc.) to take on informal leadership roles 
that would have improved the LGO community.  Some of my 
classmates did a better job with this and I think they got a lot out of it.
(1996)
I wish I'd have spent more time building networks both within LGO and 
the broader MIT community. (1998)
Understood my own personal style and strengths more fully . (1999)
I think one thing that I've learned as a leader since LGO is that leaders 
need to listen.  LGO is so full of A -type personalities, that listening is 
sometimes in short supply.  So I guess the one answer is that I wish I 
would have listened more ...(2000)</text>
