In principle we should vary the real and imaginary (e.g., hermitian and anti
hermitian) parts of (x), but we can equivalently vary  and  independently 
by dening

If wevary   maybe = (i  m) 
with respect to  , one gets the Dirac equation. Nonetheless, Peskin &amp; 
Schroeder reject   maybe because it is not Lorentz-invariant. 
This reason for rejecting   maybe seems weak to me, since it did generate the 
correct, Lorentz-inva riant Dirac equation. 
    &#13;        &#13;          10 
&#13;    maybe
A more serious problem with   maybe is that it gives inconsistent equations. Varying   maybe with respect to , one integrates the action by parts and nds   maybe = (i  m) = 
(115)(i  
  m)=0 . 
To comparewith theusual Dirac equation, wehaveto takethecomple x conjugate 
(or adjoint) of this equation. To do this we need to compute ().For our 
conventions 
   01 0 i    0 =   i =   .10 i 0 (116)

Then we can show that the action S is real: 
S = /integraldisplay

 0 (i   m)  /bracketrightbig .

    &#13;        &#13;          16 
Notethat in thelast lineweused Eq. (118), 0 () 0 = . 
Similarly wecan show that theequations of motion arenow consistent, sincethe 
equation obtained by varying  is 
  /parenleftBig

Theadjoint of this equation is

This is exactly the Dirac equation, multiplied by the (invertible) matrix 0 .

so one sees that for massless particles the upper components, L,destroynegative 
helicity particles (as destroys particles), and creates positive helicity antiparticles. 
For R it is the reverse. 
For m=0, one can have a theory with just negative helicity particles have 
and positive helicity antiparticles, or vice versa. One could have particles 
of both helicities, but there is no need for both to build a Lorentz-invariant 
eld theory.

TheDirac Lagrangian was given as Eq. (120),   Dirac =  (i   m) . 
Following the canonical procedure,

One sees that 
/parenleftbig 
0/parenrightbig = 0 /parenleftbig 
i/parenrightbig = i . (117) 
These signs are actually dictated by the original Dirac anticommutation relations 
{ , } =2g . These imply that (0)2 =1,and (i)2 = 1, so they must 
be hermitian and antihermitian respectively. The anticommu tation relations also 
imply that  and  anticommutewhe n /negationslash= . Thus wecan writefor all  that: 
0 () 0 =  . (118) 
So, taking theadjoint of Eq. (115), 
0= /bracketleftBig 
(i   m) /bracketrightBig

 =(i00  m). 
(119) 
This is   theDirac equation. 
Note that this is a counterexample to the widely believed falsehood that equations 
derived from a Lagrangian are necessarily consistent.

We already learned how to write the Dirac equation in 2  2 blocks: 
   
 m i    L  =0 .    (111)i  mR 
For thespecial caseof m =0, the two pieces decouple, giving the Weyl 
equations: 
i L =0 , i  R =0 . (124) 
L(x) and R(x) are called Weyl elds. Since 2  2 = , onecan dene 
R = 2R = i R =0 . (125) 
   
&#13;        &#13; 
       
 18 
The Weyl elds can be extracted from the Dirac eld by dening 
5  i0 1 2 3 
=  i 
4! /epsilon1     , (126) 
where /epsilon1 is the fully antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor, with the sign convention 
(following P&amp;S) 
/epsilon10123 = 1 . (127) 
Notethat this corresponds to /epsilon10123 =1. 5 is Lorentz-invariant, which one can see 
by using thefact that /epsilon1 is Lorentz-invariant, or by noting that 
/bracketleftbig 
S ,5/bracketrightbig 
=0 . (128) 
where S are the generators of Lorentz transformations dened in Eq. (45).

0 u s(/vectorq =0)=u s(/vectorq =0). 
Since q =(m, 0, 0, 0), this can be rewritten as 
q u s(/vectorq =0)=mu s(/vectorq =0) . 
Wecan show that it holds in all frames by applying 1 
2(B/vectorp )to both sides, using

  We learned that spin-1 
2 particles cannot be bosons, but can be fermions.   From Eq. (100), |L|2 =|R|2 =1, we learned that antiparticles are manda
tory. In theequal-timecommutator, theantiparticlecontribution canceled the 
particlecontribution, but only if theantiparticlecreation/annihilation operators 
areincluded in theeld with thesamemagnitudeas theparticleoperators.   Wefound that thephases of L and R had to be equal to each other, but 
were undetermi ned. This freedom to rotate both phases together should have 
been expected: it corresponds to changing the phase of all antiparticle states. 
We never dened those phases in the rst place, so it should make no dierence 
if they are changed. (All antiparticle states must have their phases changed in 
the same way, however, or else the representation of the Poincaregroup would 
haveto bechanged.)

by bs(/vectorp). That is, we could use an operator that, instead of creating an 
antiparticle with positive energy, would destroy a particle with negative energy. 
This interchange of bs and bs  would reverse the sign of bs(/vectorp) ,bs(/vectorq) that 
appeared in Eq. (93), allowing the bosonic commutator to vanish for spacelike 
separations. Such negative energy particles, however, apparently do not exist.

In this discussion, theDirac equation is a byproduct. Now that wehaveconstructe d 
the Dirac eld as a quantum operator, we can notice that it satises the Dirac 
equation. 
Recall from Eqs. (76) and (77) that 
u s 
L(/vectorq =0)= u s 
R(/vectorq =0) =  ms , (103) 
and that 
0 =  
  01 
10  
  . (104) 
Thus 0 exchanges L and R, and for /vectorq =0 the u/primes areequal. Thus 
0 u s(/vectorq =0) = u s(/vectorq =0) .

In our conventions 
5 = /parenleftbigg 
10 
0 1 /parenrightbigg 
, (129) 
which clearly separates the upper and lower halves of the Dirac eld:

For all choices of -matrices, 5 is dened by Eq. (126); it is Lorentz-invariant, 
and can be used to project L and R components of  (which are dened by the 
( 1 
2 ,0) + (0, 1

Recall that 
     p  s p  (i2 s)     u s(/vectorp)=  p   ,v s(/vectorp)=   p   . s (i2 s)

p   = p 0  p 3z = E(1  z)=2EP , 
where P = 1
2 (1  z ) is theprojector onto z = 1 states, or equivalently 
the projector onto negative helicity states. Similarly, p  =2EP +,where P+ 
projects onto z =1, or positive helicity states. Since 2 anticommutes with 
3, onehas P+2 = 2P,and P2 = 2P+. Putting all this together, 
    P s  2 P+ s     u s(/vectorp)= 2E  P+ s  ,v s(/vectorp)= i 2E  2 P s  .

It is sometimes useful to use our representation of the  matrices, and the denitions 
 =(1,i) and  =(1,i) to writetheDirac equation as: 
   
 m i    L     =0. (111)i  m R 
In this form we see that the spatial derivative mixes the upper and lower (L and 
R) components, as we commented earlier that we expected, on the grounds 
that (0, 1
2 ) and ( 21 , 1
2 ) can only produce ( 1
2 ,0) or (21 ,1). 
   
&#13;        &#13;

  &#13;   
TheDirac equation is 
(i  m)(x)=0 . (110) 
This is a 4-component equation, and the Lagrangian must be a real scalar. 
The natural guess is therefore to contract these indices with (x),where 
(x)   
         1(x) 
2(x) 
3(x) 
4(x)

(x)=

Note that Fermi statistics caused the antiparticle energy to be positive (good!), 
and the vacuum energy to be negative (surprising?). The negative vacuum energy, 
although ill-dened, is still welcome: allows at least the hope that one might 
get thepositive(bosonic) contributions to cancel against thenegative(fermionic) 
contributions, giving an answer that is nite and hopefully small. Note that if we 
had 4 free scalar elds with the same mass, the cancelation would be exact: this 
is what happens in EXACTLY supersymmetric models, but it is spoiled as soon as 
the supersymmetry is broken.

In the 1-particle quantum mechanics formulation, positrons show up as negative 
energy states. Dirac proposed that in the vacuum, the negative energy sea 
was lled. Physical positrons, in this view, are holes in the Dirac sea. In QFT, 
on the other hand, particles and antiparticles are on equal footing. Nonetheless, 
the Dirac sea allows an intuitive way to understa nd the negative vacuum energy.

LECTURE NOTES 6
PATH INTE GRALS , GRE ENS FUNC TIONS,
AND GENERA TING FUNCTIONALS
In these notes we will extend the path integral methods discussed in Lecture 
Notes 5 to descri be Green s funct ions, which we dene to be ground state expecta
tion values of the time-ordered product of Heisenberg operators.F or the case of a 
nonrelativistic particle moving in one dimensi on, discussed in Lecture Notes 5, the 
Greens functions can be writte n as 
G(tN , ..., t1) /angbracketleft0 |T{x(tN )x(tN1) ... x(t1)}| 0/angbracketright 
(6.1) 
= /angbracketleft0 |x(tN )x(tN1) ... x(t1)| 0/angbracketright , 
where |0/angbracketright denotes the ground state, and the second line assumes that we have labeled 
the time arguments so that they are time-ordered, in the sense that 
tN  tN1  ...  t1 . (6.2) 
In the quantum eld theory, the Green s functions will be dened analogou sly by 
G(xN , ..., x1) /angbracketleft0 |T{(xN ) ... (x1)}| 0/angbracketright , 
(6.3) 
= /angbracketleft0 |(xN ) ... (x1)| 0/angbracketright , 
where |0/angbracketright denotes the vacuum state, and again the secon d line assumes that the time 
argumen ts are time-ordered.In the nonrel ativistic quantum mechanics exampl e of 
Eq.(6.1), the Green s funct ions are not quantities that are particularly interesting, 
so they are usually never mentioned in a course in quantum mechanics.We will 
soon see, however, that the quantum eld theory Green s funct ions of Eq.(6.3) are 
very interesting.In particular, the entire formalis m for calculating scattering cross 
sections and decay rates will be based upon relating these quantities to the Green s 
funct ions.In addition to showing how to express these Green s funct ions as path 
integrals, in these notes we will also see that one can dene a generatin g functional 
Z[J] in such a way that the Green s funct ions can be expressed simply in terms of 
the functional derivatives of the generating funct ional.</text>

Since Eq.(6.25) implies that the funct ional dieren tiation /J(t/prime)brings down a 
factor of hi x(t/prime) in the integrand, it is easy to see that successi ve funct ional dier
entiations would bring down successi ve factors of hi x(t).Th us,

Path Integrals, Greens Functions, and Generating Functionals 
GREEN S FUN CTIONS: 
To begin, we recall that in Lecture Notes 5 we learned to express the evolution 
operator of quantum mechanics as a path integral: 
 x(tf )=xf 
Ufi = Dx(t) ei S[x(t)] ,h (6.4) 
x(0)=xi 
where  tf 
S[x(t)] = dtL(x,x) (L= Lagran gian) 
0 (6.5)tf  1 = dt mx2 V(x) .20 
We also know that the Heisen berg eld operators appearing in Eq.(6. 1) can be 
writte n as 
x(t)= e iHt x(0) e iHt , (6.6) 
where x(0) xis the Schrodinger represen tation position operator.Eq. (6.1) can S 
then be rewritte n as 
G(tN , ..., t1)= 0  e iHtN xS e iH(tN tN1 )xS ... e iH(t2 t1)xS e iHt1  0 . (6.7) 
To express this quantity as a path integral, we can insert at each operator xS 
a complete set of states in the position represen tation , using 
  
Identity Operator = dx|x/angbracketright/angbracketleftx| , (6.8) 
 
which can be multiplied by xS to give 
   
x= dxx|x/angbracketright/angbracketleftx|= dx |x/angbracketrightx/angbracketleftx| . (6.9)S S 
  
Then 
  
G(tN , ..., t1)= dx1 ... dxN 
 
0 e iHtN  xN xN xN  e iH(tN tN1 ) xN1 xN1 ... 
 x2 x2  e iH(t2 t1 ) x1 x1

Path Integrals, Greens Functions, and Generating Functionals 
GENERATING FUNCTI ONALS: 
Eq.(6.20) can be conveniently rewritten by the use of a generating funct ional, 
dened by 
 T 
T Z[J(t)]= lim Dx(t)e dt[L(x,x)+J(t)x(t)] . 
T  (1i/epsilon1) T Ti 
h(6.21)
It will then be possible to express the Green s funct ions as derivatives of the gener
ating functional. 
The derivative of a functional is called a functional derivative, as you migh t 
guess, but the denition is slightly indirect.Crudel y speaking the functional Z[J(t)] 
is a function of an innite number of arguments, J(t)for each valueof t,sothe 
derivative should look something like a partial derivative.Partial derivatives are 
dened in terms of the variation of the function when one argument is varied with 
the other arguments xed, but that will not work for Z[J(t)].If we vary J(t)for 
one value of t only, Z[J(t)] will not change at all, since the one point would have 
measure zero in the integration of Eq.(6.21). So, the funct ional derivative is dened 
by rst thinking about how a function of many variables changes when all of its 
variables are changed by a small amount.If a function of N variables is denoted 
by F(z1,...,zN ), then its rst order Taylor expansion can be writte n 
N 
F(z1 +z1,...,zN +zN )= F(z1,...,zN )+ F zj +   (z 2) . (6.22)zjj=1 
Eq.(6.22) could be used as the deni tion of F/zj , which would be equivalent 
to the usual deni tion.The functional derivative Z/J(t) is dened in analogy to 
Eq.(6. 22): 
Z[J(t)+J(t)]  Z[J(t)]+ dt/prime 
JZ 
(t/prime)J(t/prime)+   (J2) . (6.23) 
To calcu late the functional derivative of Eq.(6. 21), we write

Path Integrals, Greens Functions, and Generating Functionals 
The matrixelements inthisexpression canall be writtenaspathintegrals, 
except for the ground state matrix elements on the two ends.Ev en these matrix 
elements can be treated by path integral methods, however, by noting that the 
ground state is dened in terms of the Hamilton ian, and path integrals can be 
used to construct matrix elements of exponentials of the Hamiltonian.An arbitrary 
state, such as the state of denite position |x0/angbracketright for some constant x0, can always be 
expanded in energy eigenstates: 
|x0/angbracketright= |n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn |x0 /angbracketright . (6.11) 
n 
We can isolate the ground state contribution to this equation by multiplying by 
sides by eH ,where  is some real number: 
e H |x0/angbracketright= e E n |n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn |x0 /angbracketright , (6.12) 
n 
where on the right the operator H has been replaced by its eigenvalue En,where 
H |n/angbracketright = En |n/angbracketright.As  becomes large, the ground state contribution to the right-
hand side will be less suppressed than any other state.We can compensate for 
this suppressi on by multiplying by eE0 ,where E0 is the energy of the ground state 
|0/angbracketright|0/angbracketright.Thus, 
lim e E0 e H |x0/angbracketright= |0/angbracketright/angbracketleft0 |x0 /angbracketright . (6.13) 
 
For our path integral it will be more convenient to describe the real exponential in 
the above equation as a small correction to a much larger imagin ary exponential. 
We introduce a variable T , with units of time, taking the limit as T approaches 
innity times (1 i/epsilon1), where /epsilon1 is a small positive constant.At the end we will take 
the limit /epsilon1  0, but only after the innite limit is carried out, so that /epsilon1 = . 
If we assume that /angbracketleft0 |x0 /angbracketright/negationslash to be a point = 0, meaning that we have not chosen x0 
where the ground state wave function vanishes, then we can divide both sides of 
Eq.(6. 13) by this quantity, obtaining 
|0/angbracketright= lim e iHT |x0/angbracketright eiE0 T 
. (6.14) 
T  (1i/epsilon1) /angbracketleft0 |x0 /angbracketright 
For the bra vector, we can use the analogou s relation 
iE0 T 
/angbracketleft0|= lim e/angbracketleftx0|e iHT . (6.15) 
T  (1i/epsilon1) /angbracketleftx0 |0 /angbracketright 
Note that Eq.(6. 15) was not obtained by simply takin g the adjoint of Eq.(6. 14), 
because the adjoint equation would involve T  instead of T , which would not be 
useful for our curren t purposes.</text>

x(T )=x0 . 
T  (1i/epsilon1) 
Dx(t) eS[x(t)] 
x(T )=x0 (6.20)
In deni ng the Green s funct ions, we made the explicit choice in Eq.(6.3) 
that we would use time-o rdered products.Since the operators x(ti)do not in 
general commute, we presuma bly would have found a dierent answer if we had 
used a dierent ordering.Nonetheless, in our nal result (6.20), the ordering is 
not apparent.The product x(tN ) ... x(t1) is just a product of c-numbers in the 
integrand, so the product would have the same value if the factors were writte n in 
any order.Th us, we see that the path integral naturally picks out the time-ord ered 
product.It will turn out, however, that the time-ordered product is exactly what we 
will need to calculate cross sections, so there is a perfect t between the technique 
and the needed output. 
Operator products which are not time-ordered are still well-dened, however, 
so there ought to be some path integral method that would allow one to calculate 
them if one wanted to.If you read over the previou s derivation and think about 
what would be dierent if the operators were not time-ordered, you would nd 
that nothing would change until the step that turns Eq. (6.16) into Eq. (6.17). 
For time-ordered operators , all the time arguments appearing in the exponents of 
Eq.(6. 16) are positive semidenite, since tn+1  tn.Thus, each matrix elemen t is 
an evolution operator that evolves forward in time.If the operators were not time-
ordered, then some of the time argumen ts would be negative, corresp onding to an 
evolution operator backwards in time.S uch evolution operators can be expressed as 
path integrals, too, but the sum is over paths that go backwards in time.When the 
right-hand side of Eq.(6. 17) is combined into a single path integral, as in Eq.(6. 18), 
the paths x(t) would have to zigzag in time, sometimes going forward and sometimes 
going backwards, to repro duce the matrix elemen ts in Eq.(6.16).</text>

Path Integrals, Greens Functions, and Generating Functionals 
If we use Eqs. (6.14) and (6.15) to replace both ground state matrix elemen ts 
in Eq.(6. 10), we obtain 
2iE0 T  eG(tN , ..., t1)= lim dx1 ... dxN T  (1i/epsilon1) /angbracketleftx0 |0 /angbracketright/angbracketleft0 |x0 /angbracketright  
 iH(T tN )  iH(tN tN1 ) x0  e  xN xN xN  e  xN1 xN1 ... 
 x2 x2  e iH(t2 t1 ) x1 x1 x1  e iH(T +t1 ) x0 . 
(6.16) 
Thus, we see that the path integral is so smart that it can even calculate the ground 
state wave function for us.Th e last matrix elemen t in Eq.(6.16) can also be written 
as    iH(t1(T )) x1  e  x0 , 
which can be descri bed as the evolution operator from time T to time t1. 
If each matrix elemen t in Eq.(6.16) is expressed as a path integral by using 
Eq.(6.4),we nd 
2iE0 T  eG(tN , ..., t1)= lim dx1 ... dxN T  (1i/epsilon1) /angbracketleftx0 |0 /angbracketright/angbracketleft0 |x0 /angbracketright  
 x(tN )=xN  x(tN1)=xN1 
S[x(t)]Dx(t) ehi S[x(t)] xN Dx(t) ehi xN1 ... 
x(T )=x0 x(tN )=xN 
 x(t1 )=x1 x(T )=x0 
S[x(t)] x2 Dx(t) ehi S[x(t)] x1 Dx(t) ehi . 
x(t2 )=x2 x(t1)=x1 
(6.17) 
We see that for any twhich is not equal to one of the set {t1, ... ,tN },the quantity 
x(t) appears as one of the variables of integration in one of the path integrals.F or 
each ti in the set {t1, ... ,tN }, x(ti) is required by the limits of integration to be 
xi, which is then integrated from  to .Th us, x(t) is actually a variab le of 
integration for all values of t, provided that we recognize that x(ti)  xi.All the 
path integrals can then be combined into one path integral from time T to T,so 
Eq.(6. 17) simplies enormou sly: 
G(tN , ..., t1)=

funct ion. 
So far we have done only the free particle, so the next step is to include a 
potential energy function in the Hamilton ian: 
2 
H = p+ V (x) . (5.12)2m 
One proceeds by dividing the time interval and insert ing intermedi ate states as 
before.The crucial dierence comes in the evaluation of the matrix elemen t 
y  e iHt/h x, (5.13) 
which now involves a Hamiltonian with a potential.The easiest way to proceed is 
to use the identity 
e A e B = e A+B+ 21 [A,B]+... . (5.14) 
This relation is known as the BakerCamp bellHau sdor identity.The terms omit
ted on the right-hand-si de are all constructed from higher order iterated commuta
tors of A and B, and it is somewha t dicul t to prove the theorem in general.We, 
however, will need the theorem only to the order shown, and to this order (or any 
nite order) it is straightforward to demonstrate the relation by expanding both 
sides in a power series and then compari ng.Th us

(5.15) 
The O(t2) correct ion gives no contribution in the N  (t 0) limit, so 
to the accuracy required we can take the evolution operator to be the operator on 
the left-hand side of Eq.(5. 15). The potential energy factor then operates on the 
position-space eigenstate to the right, and can be taken outside the matrix element. 
The remaining matrix elemen t is the one already evaluated, so

QUANTUM MECHANIC S AND PATH INTE GRALS 
The goal of this section is to derive the path integral formulation of quantum 
mechanics. 
Consi der rst a free particle, moving in one dimension: 
2 
H = p. (5.1)2m 
The evolution of a state is described by applying the operator U(tf )  eiHtf /h. 
Let   
Ufi  xf  e iHtf /h xi . (5.2) 
To develop a path integral expressi on for this matrix element, begin by dividing the 
interval 0  t tf into N + 1 equal steps, so (N +1)t= tf : 
 1 2 3 N     | | | | | |
 | | | |    
0 t tf 
Now express the evolution operator eiHtf /has the product of an evolution operator 
for each interval t:  N+1 
e iHtf /h= e iHt/h. (5.3) 
Then insert a compl ete set of intermedi ate states between each factor, using 
  
1= dx| x/angbracketright/angbracketleft x| . (5.4) 
 
Callin g the variables of integration x1,x2,...,xN , 
    
Ufi = dx1 ...dxN xf  e iHt/h xN 
 (5.5) 
 xN  e iHt/h xN1 ... x1  e iHt/h xi . 
The matrix elemen ts in the above expression can be evaluated exactly by using a 
momen tum space represen tation:

y e iHt/h x = dp /angbracketleft y| p/angbracketright exp  ipt /angbracketleft p| x/angbracketright2mh

the area under g(x) must be less than the total area of the boxes.But the total 
area of the boxes is given by a geometric series, 
1 1 A= /epsilon1+ /epsilon1+ /epsilon1+ ... 2/epsilon1. (4.3)2 4 
Since /epsilon1 can be chosen as small as one likes, the area under the limit funct ion g(x) 
must be zero. 
This result does not contradict the statemen t that the area under g(x)is 1 
for any &gt;0.Rather, this is a case where the limit of an integral is not the same 
as the integral of the limit of the integran d.The integral has the value 1 for every 
&gt; 0, so the limit of the integral as   0 is 1.However, if one takes the limit of 
the integrand rst, and then integrates, the answ er is zero. 
Dirac Delta Functio n as a Distributio n: 
A Dirac delta function is dened to have the property that 
  
dx(x) (x a)  (a) . (4.4) 
 
Butwehavejust seen that thereis nofunction (x) which has this property, as long 
as integration is dened by the area under a curve.However, there is no problem 
deni ng a distribution that behaves this way.Using the notation we dened earlier 
for distributions, we dene 
(4.5) T(xa)[]  (a) . 
Here T(xa) is the name that we will use for the distribution that acts like integra
tion over the delta function (x a), and (x) is the test function.This is certainly 
a linear functional that is dened on all Schwartz funct ions, and therefo re is a tem
pered distrib ution. We interpret Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5) as mean ing the same thing, 
where the second form empha sizes the denition as a distribution, and the rst form 
empha sizes that distributions can be viewed as a generalized kind of funct ion, with 
a notation that makes them look like functions.Th at is, we dene 
  
dx(x) (x a)  T(xa)[]  (a) . (4.6) 
 
To put it dieren tly, we must remem ber that an integral over a delta function, such 
as Eq.(4. 4), is not dened as a standard integral instead it is symbolic integral, 
which is dened as a distribution which maps the function that multiplies the delta 
function to its value at the point where the argument of the delta function vanishes.</text>

INFORMAL NOTES
DIRA C DELTA FUNCTION AS A DISTRIBUTION
Why the Dirac Delta Functio n is not a Functio n: 
The Dirac delta function (x) is often descri bed by considering a function that 
has a narrow peak at x= 0, with unit total area under the peak.In the limit as the 
peak becomes innitely narrow, keeping xed the area under the peak, the funct ion 
is sometimes said to approach a Dirac delta function.One examp le of such a limit 
is 
g(x)  lim g(x) , (4.1)
0 
where 
g(x)  1 e  1
2 x 2/2 . (4.2)2 
The area under g(x) is 1, for any value of &gt;0, and g(x) approaches 0 as  0 
for any xother than x=0. 
However, it was pointed out long ago that the delta function cannot be rigor
ously dened this way.The function g(x) is equal to zero for any x =0, and is /negationslash
innite at x= 0; it can be shown that any such function integrates to zero.T o see 
this, dene the integral as the area under the curve, and consider the construction: 
In this picture the vertical axis is entirely encased in rectangles, each of which has 
height 1.Th e width of the rectan gles vary, with the lowest rectan gle having width 
/epsilon1,for some /epsilon1&gt;0, and each successiv e rectan gle has half the width of the rectan gle 
below.Note that the outline of the boxes is everywh ere above the curve g(x), so</text>

If we write these distributions as symbolic integrals, then the above equation 
becomes     
dxI(x)(x)=2 dx(xa)(x) , (4.15) 
  
where we remem bered from Eq.(4.9) that Tf[] is equal to the distribution corre
sponding to I(x).Since Eq.(4.15) holds for an arbitrary test function (x), we can 
equate the distributions without showing their argumen ts: 
  
I(x)= dpe ip(xa) =2(xa) . (4.16) 
 
The Derivativ e of a Delta Function: 
If a Dirac delta function is a distribution, then the derivative of a Dirac delta 
funct ion is, not surpri singly, the derivative of a distribution.W e have not yet 
dened the derivative of a distribution, but it is dened in the obvious way.We 
rst consider a distribution corresp onding to a function, and ask what would be the 
distribution corresp onding to the derivative of the funct ion. 
Starting with a well-behaved (i.e., piecewi se continuous and bounded by some 
power of t) function f(t), we dened the corresp onding distribution by   
Tf[]  dtf(t)(t) . (4.17) 
 
Then if we write the distribution corresponding to df/dt,weget   df Tdf/dt[]= dt (t) (4.18) dt 
Since f(t) is bounded for large |t|by a power of t,and (t) falls o faster than any 
power, we can integrate by parts without encountering a surface term:   d  d  
Tdf/dt[]=  dtf(t) = Tf . (4.19)dt dt 
This result can then be taken as the general denition of the derivative of a distri
bution: 
d T/prime[] T . (4.20)dt 
Applying this result to a delta function in the notation of Eq.(4. 6), it looks exactly 
like integration by parts: 
   d(ta) df 
dtf(t) =  . (4.21)dt dt t=a</text>

What about dpeip(xa) ? 
If we interpret this integral in the sense of Riemann or Lebesgue, it simply does 
not exist  it diverges.As a distribution, however, we can interpret 
  
I(x)  dpe ip(xa) (4.7) 
 
as the Fourier transform of 
f(p)= eipa . (4.8) 
Since I(x) is the Fourier transform of the distribution Tf [], it must itself be a 
well-dened distribution.Using the notation of distributions, the distribution cor
responding to I is then given by 
TI []= Tf [] . (4.9) 
To evaluate the distribution TI [], we rst write the distribution corresponding 
to function f(p) in the usual way: 
    
Tf []= dpf(p) (p)= dpeipa(p) . (4.10) 
  
The Fourier transform of this distribution is then dened by applying the same 
distribution to the Fourier transform of the test function, so 
  
ipa  Tf []  Tf []= dpe (p) . (4.11) 
 
But the inverse Fourier transform is given by 
(x)= 1  
dpeipx (p) , (4.12)2  
so by comp aring the two formulas above, one sees that 
Tf []=2 (a) . (4.13) 
But this is exactly the denition of the delta funct ion distribution, as given in 
Eq.(4.6),so 
Tf []=2 T(xa)[] . (4.14)</text>

In quantum eld theory (no gravity), vacuum energy is meaningless and can 
bedropped. 
In semiclassical gravity, in which the expectation value of the energy-
momentum tensor is taken as the source of a classical gravitational eld, the 
vacuum energy matters, but it can be subtracted. The subtraction, however, 
does not appear to be theoretically well-motivated. 
In string theory, any subtraction would destroy the consistency of the theory. 
The vacuum energy density is exactly zero in supersymmetric vacua, but of 
order the Planck scale (  G2 with h = c =1) for typical vacua, which is 
about 120 orders of magnitude too large. There are believed to be maybe 10500 
dierent vacua (the landscape of string theory), and anthropic arguments 
are sometimes used to explain why we nd ourselves in one of the unusual 
vacua with a very small but nonzero vacuum energy.

Note that Fermi statistics caused the antiparticle energy to be positive (good!), 
and the vacuum energy to be negative (surprising?). The negative vacuum energy, 
although ill-dened, is still welcome: allows at least the hope that one might 
get thepositive(bosonic) contributions to cancel against thenegative(fermionic) 
contributions, giving an answer that is nite and hopefully small. Note that if we 
had 4 free scalar elds with the same mass, the cancelation would be exact: this 
is what happens in EXACTLY supersymmetric models, but it is spoiled as soon as 
the supersymmetry is broken.

In the 1-particle quantum mechanics formulation, positrons show up as negative 
energy states. Dirac proposed that in the vacuum, the negative energy sea 
was lled. Physical positrons, in this view, are holes in the Dirac sea. In QFT, 
on the other hand, particles and antiparticles are on equal footing. Nonetheless, 
the Dirac sea allows an intuitive way to understand the negative vacuum energy.

To prove this equality, it is sucient to verify that Vn(x) satis es the relation s (12), 
since these were the relations that dened Vn(x).It is straigh tforward to determine 
the properties required for Bn(x)sothat Vn(x) obeys each of the relation s (12):

which matches the remainder term in A&amp;Ss equation (Eq.(19)). 
We have reached the end, but to complete the proof we must justify the in
equality (40).Th is inequality was necessary to assure the positivit y of w(x), which 
in turn was necessary for the mean value theorem. 
The only proof that I could construct for this inequality depends on showing 
that the general shape of the Bern oulli polynomials Bn(x) in the interval (0,1), for 
n 3, is always one of four possibilities, depending on nmod 4.Sample graphs 
illustratin g these shapes are shown on the following page.Specically, 
1 1 n mod 4 = 0: Bn(x) is symmetric about x=
.The maxim um is at x=
,

and x= 1.Between x=
1 
2and x= 1 the function rises monotonically to
a maximum and then falls monotonically.
1 1 n mod 4 = 2: Bn(x) is symmetric about x=

 n mod 4 =3: Bn
and x= 1.Between x=
1 
2and x= 1 the function falls monotonically to
a minimum and then rises monotonically. 
Note that we have alread y shown (by Eqs.(11), (24), and (25)) that Bn(x)vanishes 
at 0and 1for n odd.The remaining properties listed above can be shown by 
induct ion: one veries that B3(x) is being correctly descri bed, and then one uses 
Eqs.(26b ) and (26c) to show that the properties for each value of nmod 4 imply 
the properties for (n+1) mod 4. 
(Note that graphically it appears that the zeros of B6(x)and B10(x)coincide, 
but this is not exactly true.The zeros of B6(x), B10(x), and B14(x) lie at 0.2475407, 
0.2498447, and 0.2499903, respectively.) 
From the descrip tion above for Bn(x)when n is even, one can see that the 
maxim um absolute value of the function in the range 0 &lt;x&lt;1 must occur either 
at the endpoints or at x=
1 
2.We can determine which of these two it is by using
the generating function (21) to derive an identity that relates them. 
Consider the generatin g equation (21) for x= 0, but with treplaced by t/2:

5. Connectio n to the Bernoulli numbers: 
The Euler-Ma claurin summa tion formula is stated in Abramowitz and Stegun,* 
hereafter called A&amp;S, as follows: 
Let F(x)haveits rst 2n derivatives continuous on an interval (a, b). 
Divide the interval into m equal parts and let h =(b  a)/m.Then for 
some ,1 &gt;&gt; 0, depending on F(2n)(x)on (a, b), we have 
m   1 b 1 F(a + kh)= F(t)dt + {F(b)+ F(a)}h 2 k=0 a 
n1 h2k1 
+ B2k{F(2k1)(b)  F(2k1)(a)} (19)(2k)!k=1 
m1h2n  
+ B2n F(2n)(a + kh + h) .(2n)!k=0 
Disregarding for now the remainder term (the 3rd term on the right), Eq.(19) 
agrees with Eq.(17) provided that 
B2k V2k(1)= . (20)(2k)! 22k 
Accord ing to A&amp;S, p.804, the Bernoulli numbers Bn are dened in terms of the 
Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x), which are dened by the generating funct ion 
 text  tn 
= Bn(x) (for t&lt; 2).(21) et  1 n! n=0 
The Bernoul li numbers are given by 
Bn = Bn(0) . (22) 
From these relations one can easily (i.e., easily with the help of a comput er algebra 
program) calculate the lowest Bernoulli polynomials:

The goal of this appendix is to manipulate the remain der into the form given by 
A&amp;S, as shown in Eq.(19) of this documen t. I am including this appendix for 
completeness, but it is not physically important and you need not read it if you are 
not curious. 
First, notice that our denition of n is dieren t from A&amp;Ss, since the sum 
on the right-hand side of our Eq.(17) exten ds up to n, while the sum in A&amp;Ss 
equation (Eq.(19)) extends only up to n1.Thus, if our rema inder term is to agree 
with A&amp;Ss, it shoul d be expressed in terms of f2n+2,not f2n as in Eq.(32). To 
accompl ish this change, we will integrate by parts twice.The surface term vanishes 
for the rst integration by parts, since V2n+1 has an odd subscri pt and therefore 
vanishes at the endpoints accord ing to Eq.(11). For the secon d integration by parts 
there is a surfa ce term which must be kept.In detail, the two integrations by parts 
yield 
1  h 2n   2  m1 a+h  
R = dxV 2n+1 (x  a)  1 f2n+1(x + kh) (33a) 22 ha k=0 
1 h 2n+1 m1    
= V2n+2(1) f2n+1a +(k +1)h  f2n+1(a + kh)22 k=0 
1  h 2n+1  a+h  2  m1 
f2n+2(x + kh) .  dxV 2n+2 (x  a)  1 (33b) 22 ha k=0 
Now notice that the rst term on the right-hand side of Eq.(33b ) can be rewritten 
using 
 a+h 
f2n+1 
a +(k +1)h  
 f2n+1(a + kh)= dxf2n+2(x + kh) , (34) 
a 
which allows one to combine the two terms: 
1 h 2n+1  a+h 
R = V2n+2(1) dxw(x) G(x) , (35)22 a 
where 
V2n+2 h 2 (x  a)  1 w(x)=1  (36)V2n+2(1) 
and 
m1 
G(x)= f2n+2(x + kh) . (37)

set /lscript=2k and rewrite Eq.(8) as

 dxV 2n(x) f2n(x) .

3. Application to an arbitrary interv al: 
To apply Eq.(14) to an arbitrary interval a&lt;x&lt;a+ h, one needs only to 
change variables.Let f(x)= f(x), where 
h x=(x+1) + a. (15)2 
Rewritin g Eq.(14) in terms of f(x), while dividing the whole equation by 2 for later 
convenience, one has 
1
f(a)+ f(a+ h)  
=1 a+h 
dxf(x)

where fn(x) denotes the nth derivative of fwith respect to its argumen t x.Now 
that the original f and x have been elimin ated, we can drop the tilde superscripts 
that appear in Eq.(16). 
4. Application to an arbitrary sum of intervals: 
The problem can now be compl eted by extending Eq.(16) to an interval a&lt; 
x&lt;b, divided into m steps of size h=(b a)/m.Adding an expression of the form</text>

2. Elim ination of the odd /lscript contributio ns: 
Eq.(6) is valid for any choice of integration constants in Eq.(5), so we can 
seek a choice that simplies the result.Note that V1(x) is odd under xx.We 
can therefore choose the integration constan ts so that 
Vn(x) if n is even Vn(x)= (7)Vn(x)if n isodd . 
This even/odd requiremen t uniquely xes the integration constant in Eq.(5) when 
n is odd, because the sum of an odd funct ion and a constant would no longer be 
odd.We are still free, however, to choose the integration constants when n is even. 
Using the even/odd property, Eq.(6) can be simplied to 
 2n 1    
f(1) + f(1)= dxf(x)+ (1)/lscriptV/lscript(1) f/lscript1(1) (1)/lscript f/lscript1(1) 
1 /lscript=2 (8)  1 
 dxV 2n(x) f2n(x) . 
1 
Note that the terms in V/lscript(1) for even /lscript involve the dierence of f/lscript1 at the two 
endp oints, while the terms for odd /lscript involve the sum.Eq. (8) describes a single 
interval, however, and our goal is to obtain a formula valid for any number of 
intervals.We will do this by rst generalizing Eq.(8) to apply to an arbitrary 
interval axa+h, and then applying it to each interval in a successi on of evenly 
spaced intervals.When this successi on is summed, the even /lscript terms involvin g the 
dierences of the endpoints will cancel at each interior point, but the odd /lscript terms 
will add.The odd /lscript terms can therefore make a consi derabl y more compl icated 
contribution to the answer, but we can force them to vanish by using the rema ining 
freedom in the choice of integrat ion const ants.When nis even in Eq.(5), we choose 
the integration constant so that 
 1 
dxVn(x) 0 . (9) 
1 
Eq.(9) is always true for odd functions, so it is true for all n&gt; 0.It then follows 
for all n&gt;1that 
 1 
Vn(1) Vn(1)= dxVn1(x)=0 . (10) 
1 
If n is odd then Eq.(7) implies that Vn(1) = Vn(1), and so
Vn(1) = Vn(1)=0 forallodd n&gt;1 , (11)</text>

1. Expans ion by succes sive integrations by parts: 
We want an approximation that is useful for smooth functions f(x), and a 
smooth function is one for which the higher derivatives tend to be small.Th erefore, 
if we can extract more terms in a way that leaves a remainder term that depends 
only on high derivatives of the function, then we have made progress.Th is can 
be accomplished by successively integratin g by parts, each time dierentiatin g f(x) 
and integratin g the function that multiplies it.We can dene a set of functions 
V0(x)  1 ,V 1(x)  x,	 (4) 
and 
Vn(x)  dxVn1(x) .	 (5) 
Eq.(5) is not quite well-dened, however, because each indeni te integral is dened 
only up to an arbitrary constant of integration .Regardless of how these constants 
of integration are chosen, however, one can rewrite Eq.(1) by using Eq.(3) and 
then successively integratin g by parts: 
 1 1 
f(1)+f(1)= dxf(x)+ dxV 1(x) f/prime(x)

Eq.(26a) was alread y written within Eqs.(23). To verify Eq.(26b ), dieren 
tiate the generatin g equation (21) with respect to x: 
 t2ext  dBn(x) tn 
= . (27) et  1 dxn! n=0 
One can obtain another expansion of the same quantity by multiplying the gener
ating equation by t: 
 t2ext  tn+1 
= Bn(x) et  1 n! n=0 (28)  tn 
= Bn1 .(n 1)!n=1 
Comp aring like powers of t in expansions (27) and (28), one nds 
dBn = nBn1(x) , (29)dx 
which is equivalent to Eq.(26b ).Finally, to verify Eq.(26c), one can integrate the 
generating equation over x from 0to1: 
 1   1text  tn 
0 dxet  1 =1= 
n=0 n! 0 dxBn(x) . (30) 
Again by comparing powers of t, one veries Eq.(26c). Thus Vn(x)obeys allof 
the relations (12), and hence Vn(x)= Vn(x). 
Having established Eq.(24), it follows immedi ately that 
22k 
V2k(1) = V2k(1) = B2k(0) , (31)(2k)!
which is just what is needed to verify Eq.(20), and hence the agreemen t of our 
series expansion with that of A&amp;S. 
App endix : Simplicatio n of the remainder term: 
The remainder term is the nal term on the right-hand side of Eq.(17), given 
by 
1  h 2n1  a+h  2  m 1 
R=  dxV 2n (x a)  1 f2n(x+ kh) . (32)22 ha k=0</text>

By manipulating the right-hand side, it can be re-ex pressed in terms of Bernoulli 
funct ions by using the genera ting equation: 
 tn  1 t e(t/2) +1 Bn(0) 2 
n! =2 e(t/2)  1  e(t/2) +1
n=0
1 te(t/2) + t = (47)2 et  1 
 1   tn  tn 
=2 Bn 1
2 n!+ Bn(0) n! . 
n=0 n=0 
Comp aring like powers of t on both sides of the equation, one nds 
Bn(0) 1  1   
= Bn 2 + Bn(0) , (48)2n 2 
which implies that 
  1  
Bn 21 = Bn(0) 1  2n1 . (49) 
It follows that |Bn(0)| &gt; Bn 1 , and therefore Eq.(40) holds. Our proof excluded 2 
the special case B2(x), which diers from the cases of larger n in that its derivative 
does not vanish at 0 and 1.It can easily be veried, however, that the maximum 
absolute value of B2(x)for 0 &lt;x&lt; 1 must occur at x = 21 or at the endpoints, so 
Eq.(49) can again be used to show that Eq.(40) applies in this case as well.</text>

Using Eqs.(24), (25) and (31) to rewrite this expression in terms of B2n+2,one 
nds 
R= h2n+1 B2n+2  a+h 
dxw(x) G(x) , (38)(2n+2)! a 
where  xa 
w(x)=1  B2n+2 h . (39)B2n+2 
To complete the argument, one needs to use the fact that 
|B2n| &gt;|B2n(x)| (for n=1,2,...,and 0 &lt;x&lt;1) , (40) 
which we will prove below.Th is implies that the second term in Eq.(39) has 
magn itude less than 1, and hence 
w(x) &gt;0 . (41) 
Furthermore, from Eq.(26c) the secon d term in Eq.(39) vanishes when integrated 
over x from a to a+ h,so  a+h 
dxw(x)= h. (42) 
a 
Eqs.(41) and (42) imply that we can interpret w(x) as a weight factor in the 
comput ation of a weighted average, with 
  1  a+h 
G(x)  dxw(x) G(x) . (43)h a 
If we assume that every term on the right-hand side of Eq.(37) is continuous, then 
G(x) is continuous, and we can apply the mean value theorem* to conclude that, 
somewhere in the range of integration (a&lt;x&lt;a+ h), G(x)mustbe equal to its 
mean value G(x) .Thus thereexists somenumber  in the range 0 &lt;&lt; 1such 
that 
  1 a+h 
G(a+ h)= G(x)= dxw(x) G(x) . (44)h a 
Using the above relation to replace the integral in Eq.(38), one has nally 
R= h2n+2 B2n+2 G(a+ h)(2n+2)! 
(45)m1

tion formula, which was stated without derivation .Here I will give a self-contained 
derivation of the Euler-Maclau rin formula.For pedagogical reason s I will rst derive 
the formula without any reference to Bernoulli numbers, and afterward I will show 
that the answer can be expressed in terms of these numbers.A n explicit expressi on 
will be obtained for the rema inder that survives after a nite number of terms in 
the series are summed, and in an optional appendix I will show how to simplify this 
rema inder to obtain the form given by Abramowitz and Stegun. 
The Euler-Ma claurin formula relates the sum of a function evaluated at evenly 
spaced points to the corresponding integral approximation , providing a systematic 
method of calculating corrections in terms of the derivatives of the funct ion evalu
ated at the endpoints.Co nsider rst a function dened on the interval 1  x 1, 
for which we can imagine approximating the sum of f(1) + f(1) by the integral 
of the function over the interval: 
 1 
f(1) + f(1)= dxf(x)+ R1 , (1) 
1 
where R1 represen ts a correction term that we want to underst and.One can nd 
an exact expression for R1 by applying an integration by parts to the integral: 
 1  1 
dxf(x)= f(1) + f(1)  dxxf/prime(x) , (2) 
1 1 
so  1 
R1 = dxxf/prime(x) , (3)

as desired. 
The Vns are now uniquely dened.In our construction we used the antisymme
try property of Eq.(5) to x the constant of integration for odd n, and the vanishing 
of the integral in Eq.(9) to x the integration constant for even n.Eq. (9), however, 
holds also for odd n, and is sucient to x the integration constant for the odd n 
cases.The functions Vn(x) can therefore be dened succinctly by 
V0(x)  1 , (12a) 
 
Vn(x)  dxVn1(x) , and (12b)

dxVn(x)  0 (for n&gt;0) . (12c)

Note that when one adds up the left-hand sides of the expressi ons of the form (16), 
all the terms have coecient 1 except for the rst and last term, each of which have 
coecient 1
2 .In Eq.(17), the sum is written with all terms having coecient 1, and 
the correction for the rst and last term has been moved to the right-hand side. 
For all practical purposes, including the application to the Casimir eect in 
Prob lem Set 4, Eq.(17) is all that is necessary .For the Casimir application a=0, 
b= ,and h= 1, so Eq.(17) becomes

On the problem set the sum on the left started at 1 instead of 0, so the coecient 
of f(0)onthe rightwas 1
2 instead of 1
2 .(Note that the coecient of the f(0) term 
was printed incorrectly in Huangs book and in 8.323 problem sets from some years 
before 2003.) 
Before leaving the subject, however, one might want to establish the connect ion 
between Eq.(17) and the usual expression of the Euler-Ma claurin formula in terms 
of Bern oulli numbers, and one migh t wish to nd a cleaner way to express the nal 
term of Eq.(17), often called the rema inder term. One normally does not evaluate 
this term, but one wants to use it to argue that the remainder is small.</text>

Gaussi an is a Gaussi an.) 
Functio ns as Distributio ns: 
Distributions are somet imes called general ized funct ions, which suggest s that 
a function is also a distribution.Thi s is not quite true, but a wide range of 
functions can also be thought of as distrib utions.Giv en any function f(t)which 
is piecewi se continuous and bounded by some power of t for large t,one can 
dene a corresponding distribution Tf by 
  
Tf []  dtf(t)(t) . 
 
Since (t) falls o faster than any power, this integral will converge.Note that 
because the class of (t)s is very restricted, the class of possible f(t)sisvery 
large . 
Fourier Transform: 
For any funct ion f(t) which is integrable, meaning that 
  
dt|f(t)|
 
converges, dene   
f()  dteitf(t) . 
 
Fourier Transform of a Distributio n: 
To motiv ate the denition, suppose f(t) is integrabl e, and consider 
  
Tf[]= f()() d 
 
   
= dt e it f(t) () d 
  
  
= dtf(t)(t) 
 
= Tf [] . 
Note that these integral s are absolutely convergent, so there is no problem 
about interchanging the order of integration .So, for any distrib ution T, dene 
its Fourier transform by 
T[]  T[] .</text>

Note that any function f(t) which is piecewi se continuous and bounded by some 
power of t for large t can dene a distribution, and can therefore be Fourier 
transformed as a distribution. 
Relatio n to  convergence factor: 
Supp ose f(t) is not integrable, and so does not have a Fourier transform.Sup
pose, however, that there exists a continuous sequence of regulated functions 
f/epsilon1(t) which are integrable for /epsilon1&gt;0, which satisfy 
|f/epsilon1(t)| &lt;|f(t)| , 
and which for each t satisfy 
lim f/epsilon1(t)= f(t) . 
/epsilon10 
Examp le: f/epsilon1(t)= f(t)e/epsilon1|t|.Note that the regulator that we used for the 
two-point function at spacelik e separation s has this property.To show: if we 
Fourier transform f/epsilon1(t) and take the limit /epsilon1  0 at the end, it is the same as 
the distribution-theory denition of the Fourier transform. 
Proof: 
The distribution-theory deni tion of the Fourier transform is 
Tf []  Tf [] 
  
= dtf(t)(t) . 
 
The /epsilon1 prescri ption is to use 
Tf []  lim Tf [] . 
/epsilon10 
We need to show these are equivalent.Use 
  
Tf []= lim df/epsilon1()()
/epsilon10  
    
= lim d dteit f/epsilon1(t)()
/epsilon10   
  
lim dtf/epsilon1(t)(t) .

If we can take the limit inside the integral, we are done! 
Last step is proven with Lebesgue s Domi nated Convergence Theorem: If h/epsilon1(t) 
is a sequence of functions for which 
lim h/epsilon1(t)= h(t) for all t, 
/epsilon10 
and if there exists a function g(t)for which 
dtg(t) 
converges, and for which 
g(t) |h/epsilon1(t)| for all t and all /epsilon1, 
then  
lim dth/epsilon1(t)= dth(t) .
/epsilon10 
Note, by the way, that the existence of the integrable bounding funct ion g(x) 
is absolutely necessary.A simple examp le of a function h/epsilon1(t)for which one 
CANNO T bring the limit through the integral sign would be a function that 
looks something like: 
Analytic ally, this function can be written as 
1if 1 &lt;t&lt; 1 +1h/epsilon1(t)= 
0otherwise . 
Note that the square well moves innitely far to the right as /epsilon10, so h/epsilon1(t) 0 
for any t.But the integral of the curve is 1 for any /epsilon1, and hence it is 1 in the 
limit.The Lebesgue Dominated Convergence theorem excludes functions like 
this, because any bounding funct ion g(t)must be 1 for all t,so g(t) cannot 
be integrab le. 
The theorem does apply, however, to 
  
lim dtf/epsilon1(t)(t) .

Take 
h/epsilon1(t)= f/epsilon1(t)(t) ,
h(t)= f(t)(t) ,
and
g(t)= |f(t)(t)| .
Bottom Line: 
The /epsilon1 prescri ption used by physicists is equivalent to the unambiguous deni 
tion of the Fourier transform in tempered-distribution theory.Th at is, if the 
function to be Fourier-tran sforme d f(t) is not integrabl e, one can proceed as 
long as one can nd an integrab le regulator f/epsilon1(t) such that 
|f/epsilon1(t)| &lt; |f(t)| , 
and for each t,
lim f/epsilon1(t)= f(t) .
/epsilon10 
One can then Fourier transform f/epsilon1(t) instead.In the general case one cannot 
take the limit /epsilon1  0 immedi ately, but one must leave /epsilon1 in the expression for 
the distribution.Onl y after the distribution is evaluated for a particular test 
funct ion can the limit /epsilon1  0 be taken.Remember, for examp le, that we wrote 
the Fourier transform of the Feynman propagator as 
i . p2  m2 + i/epsilon1 
With the /epsilon1 in place one can carry out integrals involving the propagator, and 
then one can take the limit /epsilon1  0 at the end.If one tried to set the /epsilon1 term 
to zero imme diately, then the poles in the propagator would lead to ill-dened 
integration s.</text>

INFORMAL NOTES
DISTRIBUTIO NS AND THE FOURIE R TRANS FORM
Basic idea: 
In QFT it is commo n to encounter integrals that are not well-dened.P eskin 
and Schroeder, for examp le, give the following formula (p.27, after Eq. (2.51)) 
for the two point funct ion /angbracketleft0 |(x)(y)| 0/angbracketright for spacelike separation s (x  y)2 = 
r2: 
i   peipr 
D(r)= 2(2)2r  dp  
p2 + m2 . 
If this integral is dened in the usual way as 
  peipr
lim dp  ,
  p2 + m2 
then it does not exist.The integral can be dened by putting in a convergence 
factor e/epsilon1|p|:  peipr e/epsilon1|p|
lim dp  . 
/epsilon10  p2 + m2 
But how does one know whether a dierent convergence factor would get the 
same result? One way to resolve these issues is to treat the ambiguous quantity 
as a distribution, rather than a function.All tempered distributions (to be 
dened below) have Fourier transforms, which are also tempered distributions. 
Furthermo re, we can show that the /epsilon1-prescription used above is equivalent to 
the tempered-di stribution denition of the Fourier transform. 
Distributio n: 
A distribution is a linear mapping from a space of test funct ions to real or 
complex numbers.( An operator-valued distribution maps test functions into 
operators.) 
Test Functions: 
The space of test funct ions {(t)} determines what type of distribution one is 
discussi ng.The test functions for tempered distributions belong to Schwartz 
space, the space of functions which are innitely dieren tiable, and the func
tion and each of its derivatives fall o faster than any power for large t.The 
Gaussian is a good example of a Schwartz funct ion.Any function in Schwartz</text>

Motivation: 
1) Can use canonical formulation exactly, instead of as a starting point for 
a natural generalization. Note that ij might naturally generalize to 
3(/vectorx/prime /vectorx), but the two expressions do not even have the same units. ij 
is dimensionless, while 3(/vectorx/prime /vectorx)has units of 1/L3. 
2) For interacting theories, the lattice formulation is the easiest way to understand 
renormalization. When strong coupling is essential, as in QCD (Quantum 
Chromodynamics) and the strong interactions, the lattice is even the best way 
to calculate. 
    &#13;        &#13;           4 
Start with discrete lattice, spacing = a, and nite volume. Later take limits

From looking at the rest frame, we use 
D (R)= 2D(R)2 , 
and following thesamelogic that weused to show that ua s(/vectorp) must bea 
multipleof theidentity, hereweshow that (v2)a s must bea multipleof the 
identity. Thenormalization is arbitrary, so wecan write 
v s 
L,a(/vectorp =0) = i  m2 
asL,v s 
R,a(/vectorp =0) = i  m2 
as R , (86) 
where L and R are used here to indicate our freedom to choose the 
normalization of these terms arbitrarily, as far as the Lorentz transformations 
of the eld are concerned. We will soon nd, however, that these constants 
areconstrained.

A key result of quantum eld theory is the Spin- Statistic s Theorem,which 
says that particles of integer spin must be bosons, while particles of half-integer 
spin must be fermions. (Note that there is no such theorem in nonrelativistic 
quantum theory.) 
A full proof is beyond this course. See, for example, PCT, Spin &amp; Statistics, 
and All That, by R.F. Streater and Arthur S. Wightman, 1964. Despite the 
informal title and modest length, this book is not easy reading for most of us. 
We will, however, demonstrate a limited version of this theorem. We will 
consider the possibility that the Dirac particles are either bosons or fermions, 
and show that only the second choice gives a consistent theory. 
   
&#13;        &#13; 
       
 14 
     
&#13;     
Consider rst theboson possibility. Bosons arelikethescalar particles that wehave 
studied, with creation/annihilation operator commutators 
a s(/vectorp) ,a r(/vectorq) =(2)3 rs (3)(/vectorp  /vectorq) . 
(91h) 
bs(/vectorp) ,br(/vectorq) =(2)3 rs (3)(/vectorp  /vectorq) , 
with other commutato rs ([a, a], [b, b], and their adjoints) vanishing. The h 
in the equation number stands for hypothesis. It will turn out NOT to be 
consistent. Wewill now computetheequal-timecommutator 
(/vectorx,0) ,(/vectory,0) 
which is clearly a spacelike separation. There are two reasons why this should 
vanish.

  The elds should represent measurable quantities, so a nonzero commutator 
implies an uncertainty principle  a precise measurement of one causes the 
other to become completely uncertain. But if this happens at spacelike 
separations, then information can be transmitted faster than light.   Later we will use these elds to describe terms in an interaction Hamiltonian, 
and perturbation theory will allow us to express evolution (and hence scattering 
cross sections) in terms of time-ordered products. However, the time-ordering 
between 2 spacetime points is ambiguous if they are spacelike separated, so 
a unique answer is found only if the operators commute. So, the Lorentz
invariance of interaction s calculated in QFT would be violated if elds did not 
commuteat spacelikeseparations. 
The requirement that commutators vanish at spacelike 
separationsiscalled

In both cases the normalization is an arbitrary convention, and we can choose them

boson calculation wefound that theantiparticlecontribution was proportional 
to /bracketleftbig 
bs(/vectorp) ,bs(/vectorq) /bracketrightbig 
, which produced a minus sign because the creation and 
annihilation operators were not in their usual order. This time, however, we 
nd an anticommutator instead, so there is no change in sign. Our nal

This time let us assume that the particles are fermions, which means that only one 
particle can have a specied momentum and spin, and that the multi-particle 
basis state 
|/vectorp1 s1,... ,/vectorpN sN /angbracketright 
is antisymmetric in its particle labels. For example, 
|/vectorp1 s1,/vectorp2 s2/angbracketright= |/vectorp2 s2,/vectorp1 s1/angbracketright . (96) 
For fermions the creation and annihilation operators satisfy anticommutation 
relations 
a s(/vectorp) ,a r(/vectorq) =(2)3 rs (3)(/vectorp /vectorq) . 
(97) 
bs(/vectorp) ,br(/vectorq) =(2)3 rs (3)(/vectorp /vectorq) , 
    &#13;        &#13;  20        
Note that the antisymmetry of states, as in Eq. (96), implies that 
a s1(/vectorp1) a s2(/vectorp2)= a s2(/vectorp2) a s1(/vectorp1) , (98) 
since the creation operators create multiparticle states with the particle 
labels in the same order as the operators. Thus there is no possibility that 
fermion creation/annihilation operators could obey commutation rather than 
anticommutation relations. 
Since the elds are linear in creation and annihilation operators, if the creation 
and annihilation operators satisfy anticommutation relations, then so must the 
elds. 
If the elds anticommute at spacelike separations, that is okay. It means that 
any measurable quantity  any quantity that can appear in the Hamiltonian 
 must be bilinear in the fermi elds, and then they will commute. We might 
have expected this anyway for a fermi eld, since under a 360 rotation it turns 
into minus itself! If such a eld were measurable, what would it look like?

Expanding to rst order:   e iHt = e iHt   =   (iH)= (iH)   . (168) 
We know from Wigners theorem that any symmetry operator (any mapping of 
rays in a Hilbert space onto rays in the same Hilbert space which preserves overlap 
probabilities) can always be represented as one of the following:   a linear and unitary operator: 
U ( |1/angbracketright +  |2/angbracketright)= U |1/angbracketright + U |2/angbracketright 
/angbracketleftU2 |U1 /angbracketright = /angbracketleft2 |1 /angbracketright . (169)   an antilinear and antiunitary operator: 
A ( |1/angbracketright +  |2/angbracketright)=   A |1/angbracketright +   A |2/angbracketright 
/angbracketleftA2 |A1 /angbracketright = /angbracketleft2 |1 /angbracketright  . (170)

 aboutzero,wemustchoose tobeantiunita ry. 
/angbracketrightBig If   is unitary,   (iH)=( iH)   implies that   must anticommute 
with H.But then   would map each positive energy state into a 
corresponding negative energy state, violating the positivity of the energy. 
If we dont want a theory in which the eigenvalues of H aresymme tric 
 P&amp;S say: Theway out is to retain theunita rity condition   =   , but have   act on c-numbers as well as operators. 
BUT: Antiunita ry operators do NOT have adjoints, and   operates on the 
Hilbert space, not on c-numbers or operators. An adjoint is dened by 
   2 |1 = 2 
  1 . 
If   were antiunitary, the left-hand side would be linear in |1/angbracketright and the 
right-hand side would be antilinear, so they could not possibly be equal. 
Eq. (170) correctly denes the properties of antiunitary operators: 
A ( |1/angbracketright +  |2/angbracketright)=   A |1/angbracketright +   A |2/angbracketright 
(170) /angbracketleftA2 |A1 /angbracketright = /angbracketleft2 |1 /angbracketright .

The (3)(0) piece looks odd, but note that it would disappear if we dened normal 
products which subtracted the divergent vacuum contributions at the start. 
That is, Eq. (218) corresponds to an equation for densities 
j0 =  = :  : +2(3)(0) , so :  : =  
aa  2(3)(0) . 
Then, Eq. (222) can be rewritten as   1 :  
aa :   =   1 
aa 
   2(3)(0) 
=  
aa +2(3)(0) 
=  :  : . (223) 
46 
Thus, if   is applied to the bare charge density operator, , it changes the 
sign of thevacuum contribution as well as thecontribution of thephysical 
particles, and thus Eq. (222) contains a divergent term. However, if the 
divergent vacuum contribution is removed by normal ordering, as in Eq. (223), 
conjugation by   does not reintroduce any innite quantities. 
Thefact that   will not reintroduce innities is easy to understa nd from a dierent 
point of view. If one looks back at Eq. (208), one sees that   interchanges 
particles and antiparticles, but it does not interchange creation and annihilation 
operators. Thus, if any expression is written in explicitly normal ordered form, 
with all annihilation operators written to the right of all creation operators, 
then conjugation with   will leave it in explicitly normal ordered form.

analogous to Eq. (135) for the energy. Here I am using

From Eq. (219) onecan seethat Q counts each particle as one unit and each 
antiparticle as minus one unit, so the electromagnetic charge is given by Qe, 
where e is the charge of an electron (e&lt; 0). Notethat Qvac,as given by 
Eq. (220), can be interpreted as the charge of the particles that are needed to 
ll the Dirac sea, as described on slide 22 of the 5/9/06 lecture. Note that the 
particles lling theDirac sea havethesamesign chargeas thenormal particles.

  anticommutes with P/vectorand K/vector, and commutes with J/vector.So   |/vectorp=0,s=+/angbracketright = a |/vectorp=0,s=+/angbracketright , (150) 
where a is an undetermi ned phase. In the rest frame we can use the standard 
nonrelativistic quantum theory description of rotations, so 
|/vectorp=0,s=/angbracketright =(Jx  iJy ) |/vectorp=0,s=+/angbracketright , 
so   |/vectorp=0,s=/angbracketright = a |/vectorp=0,s=/angbracketright , 
with thesamephase a. For an arbitrary momentum, |/vectorq,s/angbracketright = U(B/vectorq ) |/vectorp=0,s/angbracketright, 
so using the canonical representation of boosts   |/vectorq,s/angbracketright =   U(B/vectorq ) 1   |/vectorp=0,s/angbracketright = a U(B/vectorq ) |/vectorp=0,s/angbracketright

(It is more complicated in the helicity representation!)

For antiparticles the story repeats, but the phase is not necessarily the same:   |/vectorq,s/angbracketrightb = b |/vectorq,s/angbracketrightb , (152) 
where the subscript b denotes an antiparticle state. Assuming further that 
multiparticle states transform as independent particles (i.e., all momenta are 
reversed, all spins remain the same, and each particle (antiparticle) contributes 
afactor a (b)), then 1 as(/vectorp)   = a as(/vectorp) , 1 a

The time reversal transformation on 4-vectors is given by 
(171) 
The matrix denes a linear transformation, however, so it is not really the 
operator that we want to describe.

The properties of   , now used exclusively to refer to the operator in the Hilbert

where we note that antiunita ry operators are invertible, but we should not 
assumethat   1 =   . 
Under rotations 
U1(R) (/vectorx,t) U(R)= (R1/vectorx,t) ,

But sincethee xponent contains an i,   must anticommutewith /vectorJ.The

For boosts, 
U1(B) (x) U(B)= (B1 x) , 
where 
U /parenleftbig 
B(n,) /parenrightbig

To combine this with Eq. (172), we need to know what happens to B1xwhen 
t is reversed. Dening T to bethematrix that reverses thetimecomp onent 
of 4-vectors, one can show the 4-vector identity 
B(n,) Tx= TB(n,) x, 
which can beused with theaboveequations to show that   reverses the 
direction of boosts, and hence   commutes with /vectorK (with the reversal 
attributed to the i in ei n /vectorK ).

Since   anticommutes with both Jz and P/vector, it must reverse both the spin and the 
momentum of the states on which it acts. So   |/vectorp=0,s=+/angbracketright = t |/vectorp=0,s=/angbracketright (174) 
For somephaset,where |t| =1.Then   |/vectorp=0,s=/angbracketright =   (Jx  iJy ) |/vectorp=0,s=+/angbracketright

Integration over /vectorx gives a factor (2)3 (3)(/vectorp  /vectorq), which can then be used to 
integrate over /vectorq. Then one uses the relations 
u  r (/vectorp) us(/vectorp)=2E/vectorp rs v  
r (/vectorp) vs(/vectorp)=2E/vectorp rs 
u  r (/vectorp) vs(/vectorp)= 0 v

Butwhatif wewant to show this? 
The complication is that we need a realization of the Poincaregroup in which trans
lations as well as boosts and rotations are represented linearly. Translations on 
coordinate 4-vectors are not linear. To nd the commutators of P,weused 
the representation of the operators on the Hilbert space of a scalar eld.

that e2iJz =1 (i.e., classically the transformation is the identity), and we

so I will give only the results, in a format that matches the description of parity

Having donetheo ther cases, chargeconjugation   is very straightfo rward.  	maps particle states into antiparticle states and vice versa, and it commutes

  |/vectorp=0,s=/angbracketright

Since   2 commutes with all the generato rs, this result holds for boosted states as 
well.   2 = 1 on spin-1 
2 states. 
On a general state, |/vectorq,s/angbracketright = U(B/vectorq ) |/vectorp=0,s/angbracketright, in the canonical representation,   |/vectorq,s=+/angbracketright =   U(B/vectorq ) |/vectorp=0,s=+/angbracketright

When we constructed  andinsistedthat   and  becausal, at Eq. (99), wefound 
that theantiparticlecontribution was constrained: R = L,with |L| = 
|R| =1. But there was an arbitrary phase, which we xed by choosing 
L = R =1. But if wenow calculate /braceleftBig 1a(/vectorx,0)   ,  (/vectory,0) /bracerightBig

Since a(x) and  a(x) each have 4 components, there are 16 possible Dirac eld 
bilinears. They can be arranged into 5 quantities with well-dened Lorentz 
transformation properties: 
  i   i  , ,  [ , ] , 5, 5. (160) 
Each quantity shown is hermitian. The number of independent components is 
1, 4, 6, 4, and 1, respectively, totaling 16 as expected.

      IvectorP 
By Wigners theorem, we know that we should expect to construct a unitary 
representation of the Poincare group in the Hilbert space. (Anti-unitary is 
excluded here, since the group is continuous.) 
We can therefore describe states with Ivectorp /negationslash=0 by boosting the Ivectorp =0 states. So we 
can dene 
|Ivectorp,s/angbracketrightU(B/vectorp ) |Ivectorp =0,s/angbracketright , (52) 
where B/vectorp is a boost that transforms the rest vector to the specied momentum 
Ivectorp. B/vectorp is not uniquely dened by this criterion. 
For Eq. (52) to beunitary, wemust beusing thecovariant normalization: 
/angbracketleftIvectorp /prime ,s /prime |Ivectorp,s/angbracketright=2E/vectorp (2)3 s/primes (3)(Ivectorp /prime Ivectorp) . 
   
&#13;        &#13; 
              
 10 
&#13;    &#13;   
Therearetwo standard ways to chooseB/vectorp , and therefore to dene a basis for the 
Hilbert space of 1-particle states: &#13;  boost in direction of Ivectorp: 
IvectoriKB(c) = B p,(|p|)= e p /vector, (53)/vectorp 
where (|Ivectorp|) is therapidity associated with Ivectorp, tanh  = |Ivectorp|/E. &#13;  boost in positive z-direction, then rotate in the z-pplane(along 
theshorter of thetwo options): 
B(h) = R(p) Bz (|Ivectorp|) . (54)/vectorp 
This process preserves the helicity, thecomponent of thespin in the 
direction of the momentum. Thus, s = helicity.

Let p =(,0,0,)
Little group: generated by J3 , M1,and M2,where
J3 = J12 
M1  K1  J2 = J10 + J13 (60) 
M2  K2 + J1 = J20 + J23 . 
Algebra of little group: 
[M1,M2]=0 
J3,M1= iM2 (61)

If two kets |1/angbracketright and |2/angbracketright are identical except for the ordering of the particles, 
they represent the same physical state. For scalar particles, |1/angbracketright = |2/angbracketright. 
We will learn (soon!) that for spin-1 particles, |1/angbracketright = |2/angbracketright, depending on 2 whether the permutation is even (+) or odd (-).

Reps with M2 /negationslashM could then be rotated by any amount, so the rep is Ivector=0 .Ivector
innite dimensional. This would involve an innite number of states with the 
same momentum, and does not correspond to anything known physically. 
M2Finite-dimensional (1D) representations with MIvector2 =0.When Ivector=0, J3 
becomes a Casimir operator, since J3 ,Mi is proportional to Mj .So in this 
case 
M1 = M2 =0 
J3 = constant  Z/2 . 
(since e4iJ3 =1 in SL(2, C)) So, for m=0 thelittlegroup does not mix 
dierent svalues. The helicity hof a massless particle is Lorentz-invariant, so 
thephoton can haveh= 1, but does not need an h=0 state. The h= 1 
states are related by parity, but not by Lorentz transformations. If neutrinos 
were massless, they could have only h= 1
2 (left-handed only).

Weassumethat a(x) is linear in creation and annihilation operators. 
Electrons are charged. The eld should have a denite charge, to construct 
charge-conserving interactions. So let a(x) contain annihilation operators 
for electrons. Then it must contain creation operators for antiparticles, i.e. 
positrons. (This is like the charged scalar eld.) Then a(x) will create 
electrons and annihilate positrons. 
Theeld must satisfy: 
e iPx a(y) e iPx = a(x+ y) ,

A one-particle state must remain a one-particle state under a Poincaretransfo rma
tion, so the space of one-particle states forms a representation of the Poincare 
group. 
P2  PP is a Casimir operator of the Poincaregroup, so a singleparticlehas a 
uniquevalueof P2 , P2 = m2,where m is called the mass of theparticle. 
Particles seem to also have a denite spin. Is this a Casimir operator? 
Answer: Yes. The operator is 
1 W2  WW , where W = Iepsilon1 JP . (50)2
W is called the Pauli-Lubanski pseudovector. In the rest frame of P onehas /vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 /bracketleftbig /bracketrightbig 
W2 = m2 /vextendsingle/vextendsingleJIvector/vextendsingle/vextendsingle . Oneknows that W2 ,J =0,since W transforms as a 
vector under Lorentz transformations. It is also translation-invariant, since 
J ,P= ig  P  g  P, 
and thesum with Iepsilon1 will vanish when two indices are contracted with P.

Consider rst P2 &gt;0, i.e., massive particles.
Diagonalize P and consider a particle in its rest frame, P =(m,0,0,0).
The subgroup of the Lorentz group that leaves P invariant is called the little
group. 
In this case, thelittle group is therotation group. 
But weknow about therotation group! 
Theparticlemust havespin j, an integer or half-integer, with 2j +1 spin states 
described by s  Jz,with s = j,j +1,... ,j. (The eigenvalue of Jz is 
often called m, but m = mass.)

where the i are the (traceless) Pauli spin matrices. Exponentiation of the i
with imaginary coecients produces all unitary determinant one 2 2 matrices,
or SU(2). Since e2iJz =  1, there are 2 matrices in SU(2) for every rotation
group element, so the rotation group is SU(2)/ Z2. The Lorentz group includes
the exponentiation of the i matrices with arbitrary complex coecients, so
unitarity is lost. Exponentiation generates SL(2, C), thegroup of complex 2 2
matrices with determinant 1. One still has e2iJz =  1 and theresulting 2:1

Status: derivation was more or less rigorous, except for ignoring problems connected 
with renormalization : evaluation of integrals in this expression will lead to 
divergences. These questions will be dealt with next term. If the theory is 
regulated, for example by dening it on a lattice of nite size, the formula 
above would be exactly true for the regulated theory. One nds, however, 
that the limit as the lattice spacing goes to zero cannot be taken unless the 
parameters m, , etc., are allowed to vary as the limit is taken, and in addition 
the eld operators must be rescaled.

Status: this derivation was more or less rigorous, making mild assumptions about 
in-and out-states. These assumptions, and the formula above, will need to be 
modied slightly when massless particles are present, since the resulting long-
range forces modify particle trajectories even in the asymptotic past. These 
modications arise only in higher order perturbation theory, and are part of the 
renormalization issue. 51</text>

The integration over x gives an energy-momentum conserving -function, and 
the uncontracted inner product produces another, so these diagrams are again a 
contribution to the 1 of S =1 + iT . 
Thecontributions to T comefrom fully connect ed diagrams, where all external

calculated, however, by the Feynman rules that Peskin &amp; Schroeder describe in 
Section 4.6. If some or all of the nal state particles are identical, then the same

This leads to a new type of contraction:
We show this kind of contraction in a Feynman diagram as an external line. 
Looking at the contracted terms from the Wick expansion, the fully contracted 
term produces a multiple of the identity matrix element,

Recall our discussion of particle creation by an external source, 
( + m 2)(x)= j(x) , 
where j was assumed to be nonzero only during a nite interval t1 &lt;t&lt;t 2. 
	In that case, the Fock space of the free theory for t&lt;t 1 dened the in-states, 
theFock spaceof thefreetheory for t&gt;t 2 dened the out-states, and we 
could calculate exactly the relationship between the two. 
	We started in the in-vacuum and stayed there. The amplitude
/angbracketleftvectorp1 vectorp2 ...vectorpN ,out |0,in/angbracketright
was then interpreted as the amplitude for producing a set of nal particles with 
momenta vectorp1 ...vectorpN . 
36 
For interacting QFTs, it is more complicated. The interactions do not turn o, and 
aect even the 1-particle states. It is still possible to dene in-and out-states 
|vectorp1 ...vectorpN ,in/angbracketright and |vectorp1 ...vectorpN ,out/angbracketright with the following properties: 
 They are exact eigenstates of the full Hamilton ian. 
 At asymptotically early times, wavepackets constructed from |vectorp1 ...vectorpN ,in/angbracketright 
evolve as free wavepackets. (The pieces of this ket that describe the scattering 
vanish in stationary phase approximation at early times.) These states are used 
to describetheinitial stateof thescatte ring. 
 At asymptotically late times, wavepackets constructed from |vectorp1 ...vectorpN ,out/angbracketright 
evolve as free wavepackets. These states are used to describe the nal state.

is an exact expression for the interacting elds, with the full operator P and

possibleto manipulatetheco rrelation functions /angbracketleft |T(1 ...n)|/angbracketright by inserting 
complete sets of in-and out-states at various places. When the correlation function 
is Fourier-transformed in its variables x1 ...xn to producea function of p1 ...pn, 
one can show that it contains poles when any pi is on its mass shell, pi 2 = mi 2,and

Since 
out(x)= e iB in(x) e iB , (2.15) 
we know from the uniqueness of the Fourier expansion that 
aout(/vectorp)= e iB ain(/vectorp)e iB . (2.16) 
We canalso verify that this equationis true by using 
aout(/vectorp)= ain(/vectorp)+ i

ain(/vectorp) ,a

This implies, up to a phase, the S|0out/angbracketright = |0in/angbracketright. We canredene the phase of |0out/angbracketright 
(or |0in/angbracketright)sothat 
S|0out/angbracketright = |0in/angbracketright . (2.20)

The probability that no particles are produced by the source is given by 
P(no particle production) = |/angbracketleft0out |0in /angbracketright|2 . (2.33) 
Logic: physical state is |0in/angbracketright, independent of time (in the Heisenberg picture). 
|0out/angbracketright = state with no particles for t&gt;t2. 
So, |/angbracketleft0out |0in /angbracketright|2 is the probability that the physical state of the system would 
be measured to have 0 particles at t&gt;t2. To express the answer in terms 
of the S-matrix, recall 
|0out/angbracketright = S1 |0in/angbracketright =/angbracketleft0out| = /angbracketleft0in| S. (2.34)

So

    eF+G = eFeGe 21[F, G]
To prove this identity, dene 
H1()  e (F +G) ,H2()= e F e G e  1 2[F,G] . (2.28) 2 
Clearly H1(0) = H2(0) = I(identity operator), and 
dH1() =(F+ G) H1() . (2.29)d 
So if we canshow that H2() obeys the same dierential equation as above, then 
it follows that H2()= H1(). Youll get to show this onyour next problem set. 
This is actually a special case of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdor formula, which 
has the general form 
e F e G = e F +G+ 1[F,G]+...(iterated commutators) . (2.30) 2 
Well prove this, too, ona problem set soon.

a  
out(/vectorp)= a  
in(/vectorp)  i  
2Ep (p) , (2.9) 
where 
(p)=   (p) , (2.10) 
since j(x)is real, and 
p 0 =  
/vectorp2 + m2 . (2.11) 
Thus, only the mass shell component (p0 =  
/vectorp2 + m2)of (p) results inparticle 
creation. This is just the classical phenomenon of resonance occurring in the 
quantum eld theory setting. 
    &#13;        &#13;    &#13;      4 
            
It is useful to construct a unitary transformation that relates in and out quantities. 
Remembering that DR(x y)= (x0  y0) /angbracketleft0 |[in(x) ,in(y)]| 0/angbracketright, recall also that 
[in(x) ,in(y)] is a c-number, so /angbracketleft0 |[in(x) ,in(y)]| 0/angbracketright =[in(x) ,in(y)].So for 
x0  t&gt;t2, 
(x)= out(x)= in(x)+ i d4 y[in(x) ,in(y)] j(y) . (2.12) 
If we dene  
B d4yj(y) in(y) , (2.13) 
then 
out(x)= in(x)+ i[in(x) ,B] . (2.14) 
But [in(x) ,B] is also a c-number, so we can write 
out(x)= e iB in(x) e iB . (2.15)

Status: this derivation was more or less rigorous, making mild assumptions about 
in-and out-states. These assumptions, and the formula above, will need to be 
modied slightly when massless particles are present, since the resulting long-
range forces modify particle trajectories even in the asymptotic past. These 
modications arise only in higher order perturbation theory, and are part of the 
renormalization issue. 46

Recall our discussion of particle creation by an external source, 
( + m 2)(x)= j(x) , 
where j was assumed to be nonzero only during a nite interval t1 &lt;t&lt;t 2. 
	In that case, the Fock space of the free theory for t&lt;t 1 dened the in-states, 
theFock spaceof thefreetheory for t&gt;t 2 dened the out-states, and we 
could calculate exactly the relationship between the two. 
	We started in the in-vacuum and stayed there. The amplitude
/angbracketleft/vectorp1 /vectorp2 .../vectorpN ,out |0,in/angbracketright
was then interpreted as the amplitude for producing a set of nal particles with 
momenta /vectorp1 .../vectorpN .

But, to use Wicks theorem, we must dene time-ordering and normal ordering 
for fermion operators.

Suppose x and y are spacelike separated, with y0 &gt;x0.Then 
(x)(y)= (y)(x) . 
The RHS is already time-ordered, so T{(y)(x)} = (y)(x).If T is to 
act consistently on both sides, then 
T{(x)(y)} = (y)(x) . 
Generalizing, 
T{12 ...n}
=(product of s ordered by time, earliest to right)  (1)N ,
where N is the number of interchanges necessary to bring the ordering on the 
LHS to theordering on theRHS. (Here represents a general Fermi eld,

This formula holds whether the nal state particles are distinguishable or not. In 
calculating a total cross section, however, one must not double-count nal states. If 
thenal statecon tains n identical particles, one must either restrict the integration 
or dividetheanswer by n!.

Denition:

Therefore

Complication: 
/angbracketleft/vectorp1 .../vectorpn |S|/vectorpA/vectorpB/angbracketright/angbracketleft/vectorp1 .../vectorpn,out |/vectorpA/vectorpB,in/angbracketright , 
but the in-and out-states are hard to construct: even single-particle states are 
modied by interactions. Thesolution will makeuseof thefact that 
/vextendsinglee /vextendsingle /angbracketleft |(x)|/vectorp/angbracketright= /angbracketleftbig 
 iP x(0)e iP x /vectorp /angbracketrightbig 
= e ipx /angbracketleft |(0)|/vectorp/angbracketright 
is an exact expression for the interacting elds, with the full operator P and 
the exact eigenstate |/vectorp/angbracketright. By generalizing this to in-and out-states, it will be 
possibleto manipulatetheco rrelation functions /angbracketleft |T(1 ...n)|/angbracketright by inserting 
complete sets of in-and out-states at various places. When the correlation function 
is Fourier-transformed in its variables x1 ...xn to producea function of p1 ...pn, 
one can show that it contains poles when any pi is on its mass shell, pi 2 = mi 2,and 
that theresiduewhe n all thepi areon mass shell is theS-matrix element. 
48 
A derivation will be given in Chapter 7, but for now we accept the intuitive notion 
that U(t2,t1) describes time evolution in the interaction picture, and that the 
S-matrix describes time evolution from minus innity to innity. So we write 
/angbracketleft/vectorp1 .../vectorpn |S|/vectorpA/vectorpB/angbracketright

amputate d , 
where connected means that the disconnected diagrams will cancel out as before, 
and the meaning of amputated will be discussed below. It will be shown in 
Chapter 7 that this formula is valid, up to an overall multiplicative factor that 
arises only in higher-order perturbation theory, and is associated with the rescaling 
of eld operators required by renormalization.

where N is the number of interchanges necessary to bring the ordering on the

For interacting QFTs, it is more complicated. The interactions do not turn o, and 
aect even the 1-particle states. It is still possible to dene in-and out-states 
|/vectorp1 .../vectorpN ,in/angbracketright and |/vectorp1 .../vectorpN ,out/angbracketright with the following properties: 
 They are exact eigenstates of the full Hamilton ian. 
 At asymptotically early times, wavepackets constructed from |/vectorp1 .../vectorpN ,in/angbracketright 
evolve as free wavepackets. (The pieces of this ket that describe the scattering 
vanish in stationary phase approximation at early times.) These states are used 
to describetheinitial stateof thescatte ring. 
 At asymptotically late times, wavepackets constructed from |/vectorp1 .../vectorpN ,out/angbracketright 
evolve as free wavepackets. These states are used to describe the nal state.

This leads to a new type of contraction: 
We show this kind of contraction in a Feynman diagram as an external line.

term produces a multiple of the identity matrix element,

contains terms where one (x) contracts with an incoming particleand theother 
contracts with an outgoing particle, giving the Feynman diagrams 
The integration over x gives an energy-momentum conserving -function, and 
the uncontracted inner product produces another, so these diagrams are again a 
contribution to the 1 of S =1 + iT . 
Thecontributions to T comefrom fully connect ed diagrams, where all external 
lines are connected to each other.

The formula for decay rates is more dicult to justify, since decaying particles have 
to be viewed as resonances in a scattering experiment. For now we just state the 
result. By analogy with the formula for cross sections, 
d = |M (/vectorpA/vectorpB {
z /vectorpf })
z|2 
dn(pA + pB) ,(2EA)(2EB) |v v|A B
wewrite 
d = |M (/vectorpA {/vectorpf })|2 
dn(pA) .2EA 
Here M cannot be dened in terms of an S-matrix, since decaying particles cannot 
be described by wavepackets constructed in the asymptotic past. M can be 
calculated, however, by the Feynman rules that Peskin &amp; Schroeder describe in 
Section 4.6. If some or all of the nal state particles are identical, then the same 
comments that were made about cross sections apply here.

Status: derivation was more or less rigorous, except for ignoring problems connected 
with renormalization : evaluation of integrals in this expression will lead to 
divergences. These questions will be dealt with next term. If the theory is 
regulated, for example by dening it on a lattice of nite size, the formula 
above would be exactly true for the regulated theory. One nds, however, 
that the limit as the lattice spacing goes to zero cannot be taken unless the 
parameters m, , etc., are allowed to vary as the limit is taken, and in addition 
the eld operators must be rescaled.

as we would expect if 1(/vectork) is proportion al to an annihilation operator. 
Using the same techniques, we can now calculate 
1(/vectork) , 
1(/vectorq)=1 d3 x d3 ye i(/vectork /vectorxk t) e i(/vectorq y/vectorq t) 
4 
i i  (/vectorx,t)+ (/vectorx,t) ,(/vectory,t)  (/vectory,t)k q

.4 k q 
 2 h h = (2)3 3(/vectork /vectorq) = (2)3 3(/vectork /vectorq) .4 k 2k 
The standard (continuum) denition of the annihilation operator is then given by 
a(/vectork)= 2
k 1(/vectork) , (58)h 
so the comm utation relation s become 
a(/vectork) ,a(/vectorq) =0 ,a(/vectork) ,a (/vectorq) =(2)3 3(/vectork /vectorq) . (59) 
Using Eqs.(43), (51), and (58), the eld operator can now be expressed in terms of 
creation and annihilation operators: 
(/vectorx,t)= d3k ha(/vectork) e i(/vectork xk t) + a (/vectork)e i(/vectork /vectorxk t) . (60)(2)3 2k 
Note that in the second term I have changed variables of integration , /vectork /vectork,towrite

Finally, it is also useful to rewrite Eq.(53) in terms of the properly normaliz ed annihilation 
operator, so that one can express the annihilation operator in terms of the eld and 
canoni cal momen tum density: 
a(/vectork )= 
2h k d3 xe i(/vectork /vectorxpt) (/vectorx, t)+ i 
p (/vectorx, t) . (62) 
We migh t also want the corresp onding formula for the creation operator, which can be 
found simply by taking the adjoint of the above equation: 
a (/vectork )= 
2h k d3 xe i(/vectork /vectorxpt) (/vectorx, t)  i 
p (/vectorx, t) . (63) 
The boxed equations above are the primary results that we will continue to use

3. REVIEW OF SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLA TOR: 
We will soon see that each Fourier comp onent of a scalar eld obeys the equations 
of a harmon ic oscillator, so it is useful to review the quantum mechanics of a harmon ic 
oscillator before we proceed. 
Consider the Lagran gian for a simple harmon ic oscillator, which can be writte n as 
L =1 q2  1 2 q 2 , (27)2 2 
where we have adopted units for which the mass m of the harmon ic oscillator is one.The 
canoni cal momen tum is L p = =q, (28)q
and the Hamilton ian is 
H = pq  L =1 p 2 +1 2 q 2 . (29)2 2 
The canonical comm utation relation is 
[q, p]= i (30) h. 
Now we can dene creation and annihilation operators 
a =   
2h q + i 
2h p, a  =   
2h q  i 
2h p, (31) 
so that 
a, a =1 . (32) 
The Hamilton ian can be rewritten as 
1 H =h a  a + . (33)2 
The comm utators of H with the creation and annihilation operators are 
H, a=h a , [H, a]= ha , (34) 
from which it follows that the result of applying a to an eigenstate of H is to produce 
an eigen state of H with an eigen value higher than the original by h, while a acts on an 
eigenstate of H to lower the eigen value by h.Theground stateof H therefore satises 
a|0/angbracketright =0 , (35)</text>

ik  k (k,i)  k , (14) a 
where k/prime(k,i) denotes the lattice site that is a distance ain the ith direction from the 
lattic e site k. 
The canonical momen ta are then given by 
pk = L =    k V = k V. (15) 
k k 
Since the canonical momenta are proportional to V, it is natural to dene a canonical 
momentum densi ty k by 
k  pk 
V = 

  
kk = k . (16) 
Following Eq.(5), the Hamilton ian is then 
H= pkk  L= kk    k V. (17)

The canonical comm utation relation s become 
[k ,k]=0 , [pk ,pk]=0 , and [k ,pk]= ihkk . (18) 
In terms of the canoni cal momen tum densities, 
ikk h[k ,k]=0 , [k ,k]=0 , and [k ,k]= . (19)V 
Although we have not yet constructed the full theory, it is not too early to write down 
the continuum limit of these dening equations.The continuum canonical momentum 
densi ty becomes

For most of this course we will use units for which h  1, but for now I will leave the hs 
in the equation s.The Hamilton ian H(pi,qi) is then also an operator on the Hilbert space, 
and in the Schrodinger picture the physical states evolve according to the Schrodinger 
equation 
 ih |(t)/angbracketright = H |(t)/angbracketright . (7)t 
If H is independent of time, Eq.(7) has the formal solution 
|(t)/angbracketright = e iHt/h|(0)/angbracketright . (8) 
Given any operator   , its expectation value in the state |(t)/angbracketright is then given by 
/angbracketleft(t) |   | (t)/angbracketright = (0)  eiHt/h  e iHt/h (0) . (9) 
This equation leads naturally to the Heisenberg picture description, in which the states 
are treated as time-indep endent, and all of the time dependence is incorporated into the 
evolution of the operators:   (t)= eiHt/h  e iHt/h. (10) 
2. FIEL D QUANTIZATION BY LATTICE APPR OXIMATION : 
To quantize the classical eld theory of Eq.(2), we can begin by quantizing a lattice 
version of the theory.Tha t is, we can replace the continuous space by a cubic lattice 
of closely spaced grid points, with a lattic e spacing a, and we can trunca te the space to 
a nite region.The system then reduces to one with a discrete number of dynamical 
variables, exactly like the systems that we already know how to quantize.Then if we 
can take the limit as the lattice spacing a approaches zero and the volume approaches 
innity, the quantization of the eld theory can be completed.W e will see later that the 
a  0 limit is problematic for interacting theories, but we will see here that this program 
can be carried out easily for the free theory. 
When we replace the continuous space by a nite lattice of points, we can label each 
lattic e site with an index k.In a fully detailed lattice description we would probably label 
each lattic e site with a triplet of integers representing the x, y,and z coordinates of the 
site, but for presen t purposes it will suce to imagi ne simply numbering all the lattice 
sites from 1 to N,where N is the total number of sites.Th e eld (/vectorx,t) is then replaced 
by a set of dynamical variables k(t), where one can think of k (t)as representing the 
average value of (/vectorx,t) in a cube of size a surro unding the lattice site k.The Lagran gian 
of Eqs.(1) and (2) is then replaced by 
L =   k V, (11)

and the Hamilton ian becomes 
H = d3 x    . (21) 
The trivial canonical comm utation relation s carry over trivially: 
[(/vectorx /prime,t) ,(/vectorx,t)]=0 and [(/vectorx /prime,t) ,(/vectorx,t)] = 0 , (22) 
obviously.For the nontrivial commutation relation, the result will be clearest if we rst 
rewrite the last equation in (19) as a sum which will become an integral in the limit.If 
we let   denot e a region of the lattice, the last equation in (19) becomes 
  1if k/prime  [k ,k]V = ih k ,k = ih (23)
0otherwise. k   k   
In the continuum limit 
[k ,k]V 
k   
clearly approaches 
d3 x [(/vectorx /prime,t) ,(/vectorx,t)] , 
/vectorx   
so Eq.(23) becomes 
d3 x [(/vectorx /prime,t) ,(/vectorx,t)] = ih1if /vectorx/prime    (24) 
/vectorx   0otherwise. 
This relation ship can be expressed more conveniently by introducing the Dirac delta-
funct ion 3(/vectorx), which is dened by its integral*: 
d3xf(/vectorx) (/vectorx /vectorx /prime)  f(/vectorx/prime)if x/prime    (25) 
/vectorx   0 otherwise. 
Given this denition, Eq.(24) can be rewritten as 
[(/vectorx /primex,t)] = ix /vector/prime) . ,t) ,(/vector h(/vectorx (26) 
Note that the delta function is symme tric, so (/vectorx /vectorx/prime)= (/vectorx/prime  /vectorx). 
* Note that one often thinks of the Dirac delta funct ion 3(/vectorx) as the limit of a sequence 
of functions which each integrate to 1, but which become more and more sharply peaked 
at /vectorx = 0.This approach is useful for intuition, but it is not mathematic ally rigorou s.It 
can be shown that there exists no functio n that has the properties ascribed to the Dirac 
delta function.The Dirac delta function is actually a distributio n, not a function.We 
will return to the denition of the Dirac delta function later in the course.The bottom 
line, however, is that the delta funct ion can be dened, and the deni tion of an integral 
suitably generalized, so that Eq.(25) becomes exactly true by deni tion.</text>

4. QUANTIZA TION OF THE SCALAR FIELD: 
We have used the continuum limit of the lattice version of the theory to obtain the 
key results 
(/vectorx, t)=    = (/vectorx, t) , (20)
(/vectorx, t) 
H = d3 x    , (21) 
[(/vectorx /prime,t) ,(/vectorx, t)]=0 and [(/vectorx /prime,t) ,(/vectorx, t)] = 0 , (22) 
and 
[(/vectorx /primex, t)] = ix  /vector/prime) . ,t) ,(/vector h(/vectorx (26) 
Having done this, we can now proceed with the continuum theory directly.</text>

so 
(/vectork,t)= 1(/vectork)e i pt +  
1(/vectork)e i pt . (51) 
The relation  = then implies that 
(/vectork,t)= ip1(/vectork)e i p t + ip 
1(/vectork)e i pt , (52) 
and then Eqs.(51) and (52) can be solved simultaneously to give an expression for 1(/vectork): 
1(/vectork)= 1

(/vectork,t)+ i 
p (/vectork,t)  
e i p t 
  (53) 
=1 d3 xe i(/vectork /vectorxp t) (/vectorx,t)+ i(/vectorx,t) ,2 p 
where the secon d line was obtained by using Eqs.(41) and (42). Note that although 
the right-hand side contains quantities that depend explicitly on t, Eqs.(51) and (52) 
guarantee that the full expression is independent of time.By comp aring with Eq.(31), 
one sees that 1(/vectork) bears some resem blance to an annihilation operator.T o test this 
hypothesis, we can comput e 1(/vectork) ,1(/vectorq) and 1(/vectork) ,1 (/vectorq). 
Using Eq.(53) and the canonical comm utation relation s, 
1(/vectork) ,1(/vectorq)=1 d3 x d3 ye i(/vectork /vectorxk t) e i(/vectorq y/vectorq t)

i i  (/vectorx,t)+ (/vectorx,t) ,(/vectory,t)+ (/vectory,t)k q

We now use the identity 
d3 xe i(/vectork +/vectorq )/vectorx =(2)3 3(/vectork + /vectorq) , (55) 
which implies that the only possible nonzero contribution to Eq.(54) arises when /vectorq = /vectork, 
but in that case the factor in curly brackets vanishes.Th us, 
1(/vectork) ,1(/vectorq) =0 , (56)</text>

We view (/vectorx,t) as a collection of dynamical variables, in the classical theory, which 
have been promoted to operators in the quantum theory, exactly as we did for the discrete 
system in Section 1.We can then use the Fourier transform to dene convenient linear 
combination s of these operators : 
(/vectork,t)  d3 xe i/vectork /vectorx (/vectorx,t) , (41) 
and 
(/vectork,t)  d3 xe i/vectork /vectorx (/vectorx,t) , (42)
so that the Fourier inversion theorem implies that 
(/vectorx,t)= d3ke i/vectork /vectorx (/vectork,t) (43) (2)3 
and 
(/vectorx,t)= (2d
3k 
)3 e i/vectork /vectorx (/vectork,t) . (44) 
The fact that (/vectorx,t) is a real classical variab le and hence a Hermitian quantum operator 
implies that 
(/vectork,t)= (/vectork,t) , (45) 
with a similar relation for (/vectork,t). 
The Heisen berg equation s of motion for (/vectorx,t) are the same as the classical equation s 
of motion : 
2  /vector2+ m 2 =0 . (46)t2 
Since we have not set h to one, we should keep in mind that m in this equation has the 
units of an inverse length, and not a mass.Eq. (46) implies that the Fourier transform 
eld obeys 
2
(/vectork,t)+(/vectork2 + m 2) (/vectork,t)=0 . (47)t2 
The general solution to this equation can be written as 
(/vectork,t)= 1(/vectork)e i pt + 2(/vectork)e i pt , (48) 
where  
p = /vectork2 + m2 . (49) 
The reality condition (45) implies that 
2(/vectork)= 1 (/vectork) , (50)</text>

LECTURE NOTES 1
QUAN TIZATION OF THE FREE SCALAR FIELD
As we have alread y seen, a free scalar eld can be describ ed by the Lagran gian 
L= d3 x   , (1) 
where 
1 1   =2  2 m 22 (2a) 
=1 2  1 ii 1 m 22 . (2b) 2 2 2
Our goal is to quantize this theory, in the sense of developing a quantum theory that 
corresp onds to the classical theory described by the above Lagrangi an. 
1. CANONI CAL QUANTI ZATION: 
Here we will use the method of canonical quantization, which I assume is already 
familiar to you in the context of quantum mechanics.Specically, suppose that we were 
given a Lagran gian with a discrete number of dynamical variables qi: 
L= L(qi,qi,t) . (3) 
The canonical momen ta would then be dened by 
L pi  , (4)qi 
and the Hamilton ian would be given by 
H = pi qi  L. (5) 
i 
A quantum theory corresp onding to this classical theory could then be constructed 
by promotin g each qi and pi to an operator on a Hilbert space, and insisting on the 
canonical comm utation relation s 
[qi ,pj ]= ihij . (6)</text>
