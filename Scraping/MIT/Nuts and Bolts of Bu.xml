Investment Rounds 
50-50-50 
Consulting  Series A -$5M invested on $5M pre -money (50%) 
 Series B -$10M invested on $15M pre-money (40%) 
Nuts  Note Series A 50% ownership is diluted by 40% to 30% 
And$ Invested and Ownership % 
Bolts  VC has $15M invested 
 VC owns 70% (30% + 40%) 1/23/14

 3 * $15M = $60M -- 5 * $15M = $90M 
 Company valuation needs to be $85M and $130M 
 Your revenues need to be $40M to $60M

What VCs Want 
VC Investment goals: 50-50-50 
Consulting  3x to 5x absolute returns 
 5 to 7 year investment horizon 
Nuts  4x in 5 years = IRR of 32% 
And VC Requirements 
Bolts  Get a significant amount of $ invested (at least $5M -$10M) 
1/23/14  Own a significant ownership % (50% +-)
The Formula 
 VC % = $invested / (pre -money valuation + $invested) 
 Pre-money valuation is companys value prior to investment 
 Post-money valuation = pre-money + $invested

          <text>What to Patent
 
 Determining What to Patent 
 Probably the most important step 
 Do NOT ask What can I get a patent on? 
 Ask instead What do I want a patent on? 
 What is of commercial value to my company? 
 How would my competitors use my technology? 
 Compare against the prior art

	 Full ratchet: Conversion Price reset to equal 
price at which diluting security is sold 
	 Weighted average: CP new=CP old*R

	 Right to Prevent Trespassers 
	 Prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the

Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code
 
	 Rule: 
	 If you receive property in connection with providing 
services.. 
	 You have Ordinary Income (taxed up to 35%+) equal to: 
Fair Market Value of Property 
minus What You Paid 
	 Example: 
	 I like your idea, I will give you $1m for 50%, lets set up the company: 
Fair Mkt Value = $500,000 Fair Mkt Value = $1,000,000 
You Paid = 0 You Paid = 0 
Ordinary Income= $500,000 Ordinary Income= $1,000,000 
Tax @ 40% = $200,000 Tax @ 40% = $400,000

 SESSION 1: BUSINESS PLAN BASICS 
Why Write a Business Plan? 
January 2014 Planning Debate 
The News: Some academics doubt the 
conventional wisdom that formal written 
business plans do much to help start-ups succeed. 
The Background: Some recent studies 
suggest theres little correlation between 
having a business plan and profitability. Advocates of business plans counter that the plans give entrepreneurs focus and prevent costly mistakes. 
The Bottom Line: There are questions 
whether entrepreneurs may be spending 
months fine-tuning 50 page business plans, when they might be better off just sketching out basic financial projections and launching the business.

Why Write a Business Plan? 
 Because I Need to Understand My Business 
	 The Business Plan is a result of a PLANNING 
PROCESS 
	 People dont Plan to Fail ; they Fail to Plan 
	 Who are your customers/users? 
	 Will the buy or use your service or product? 
	 What will they pay? 
 Or how will you capture value for your efforts 
	 How will you make and deliver the service/product 
	 What resources (people, money, technology) will you 
need?

    <lecture>
      <lecture_title>Many entrepreneurs, especially technology based entrepreneurs, are accused of being too in love with their technology or concept. They rationalize that if they develop a better mousetrap then the product will sell itself. However, a good technology or product idea is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to establishing and growing a successful business venture. Who will buy the product? How will you reach buyers? How much will they pay?
If you have an idea for a product or service, how do you determine whether there is a market for it? How do you develop a marketing strategy? How do you turn your idea and market research into sales? What do you need to do to convince potential investors that there is a market and that your idea is viable? If you don&#8217;t have a specific product or service idea but you see a potential need, how do you turn the need into a product or service?
This session will discuss these issues and provide guidance on how to approach the marketing section of your business plan.</lecture_title>

Whats broke that my product fixes? 
Who cares? That is, who is trying to fix that
 
problem? How many of them are there?
 
Do they have any money? 
How do I find them? 
How are they solving the problem now? 
Why is my solution compellingly better than what theyve been doing?

          <text>Our answer: NiteBite 
Timed-release glucose bar 
for the nutritional management of hypoglycemia 
Patented formulation: nutrients that turn to
 
glucose at different rates: called it timed-
release glucose
 
Designed to lower incidence of hypoglycemia without causing hyperglycemia 
Tasty; non-medical name, packaging (Why?)
 
Looks like energy bar rather than medicine

The close (consumer): 
No more free shipping Would you like to buy NiteBite where 
you buy your insulin? 
Wheres that? May I call them? 
The close (pharmacy): 
Your customers want our product &amp; you dont have it 
What can we do about that? 
We took their initial order re-orders at larger volumes 
No one ever mentioned slotting fees 
What gave us that negotiating power?

          <text>Acid test: the 30-second sell
 
If you cant tell your story to a customer in 30 seconds or 
less, youre in trouble 
You need focus to create brochures, collateral material 
Your idea may not have real benefits to your customers (or 
you may not understand them) 
If you cant summarize your story for an investor in 30 
seconds or less, youre unlikely to raise any money 
Remember: customers buy BENEFITS. Tell us the benefit of your idea/product/service. 
This takes more work than youd think

        <slide>
          <slideno>43</slideno>
          <text>More lessons re: building the sales model 
Even if customers need your product or service, if 
they dont want it, you cant sell it 
In the early stages, it doesnt matter who needs it the only thing that matters is who wants it 
If you cant find your customers, you cant sell your product 
If you cant communicate your product benefits
 within seconds, you cant sell it (Oops)

Solution 
We can deliver a

medical company 
$300MM company, on track to go public wed all make $$$ 
Nutrition division was very profitable business 
Saw impending market changes my business would go 
away threatened our ability to go public (oops) 
I wanted (and needed) to explore new opportunity 
Potential re-positioning of corporation 
First in country to do this no model for success existed

          <text>Medical background 
Hyperglycemia: major cause of retinopathy,
 
nephropathy, neuropathy
 
Tight control dramatically reduces incidence of high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) 
But with tight control, the incidence of
 hypoglycemia ( low blood glucose) triples
 
Hypoglycemia: must be treated right away, leads to fainting, can lead to coma

          <text>Changing buying habits 
For consumers to change their buying habits
requires a LOT of motivation 
Powerful motivators include: 
Pain 
Fear 
Greed 
Vanity 
Virtue is a tough sell

          <text>A different way of looking at this 
Its not sales, its forensics 
Instead of promoting your product, 
its finding your customer 
Customers hire products to do a job 
Design your products to do a specific job for a specific kind of customer 
Then go find those customers 
If youve done this right, the selling will be easy

          <text>Ways to do that: 
TALK with your prospective customers  theres only 
so much you can glean from reports 
Interviews, focus groups, mall intercepts 
Telephone calls, consumer hotlines, user groups 
KNOW them: how do they view their problem? 
What are they buying now to solve the problem? 
What do they read? To whom do they go for advice? Who are their influencers? 
Understand whats behind what theyre asking for (Henry Ford quote)

          <text>Lessons I hope Ive learned 
Know your customers intimately: what are they 
really buying? 
Products which are for everyone arent for anyone positioning is imperative (air for 
scuba divers) 
Face it: no one needs your product or service (I dont need these glasses) 
They might need its benefits se ll the benefits 
firs
t, then the reason to believe

          <text>Why? 
We surveyed the clinicians, but: 
they dont buy it 
they dont eat it 
When we finally talked to the patients
 
they didnt want it 
they couldnt afford it 
Retailers: wont carry it

400,000 dialysis patients, rapidly growing market; it was 
easy to locate both the patients &amp; the caregivers 
Patients were generally fluid-restricted, clinically malnourished, need life-long nutrition supplementation 
All existing nutrition supplements were liquids  obviously 
bad for fluid-restricted customers 
We had the technology to formulate a nutrition supplement that met customers specific needs without

Ran ads: 
At 100 calls/day, we got more phones 
At 200 calls/day, hired more sales staff to answer the phones 
At 300 calls/day, installed a database to track all these people 
At 500 calls/day, rented tables &amp; chairs to hold the extra computers, 
started training our new staff we might be onto something 
Hired/trained inside sales force 
Penetrated all major pharmacy chains &amp; were stocked in all 
major wholesalers without ever paying slotting fees (very difficult)

A standard concern for investors: FEAR that you will 
lose the money 
Primary goal: determining if you have a chance of succeeding with your business 
Non-negotiable requirement: CUSTOMERS 
Therefore: 
Do you have any customers? Will you have any? Do you 
even know that you need them? 
How will you get them? How much is each worth? How many do you need? How long will it take you to get them?
