2.Localized:Advantages 
Can treat only one moleculeIntegration is expensiveCan incorporate exchange
No correlation methods
Can or dont have to use pseudopotentials
3.Localized:Disadvantages 
Cant use HF forces (expensive otherwise)FFT (nite fourier transform) is harderMore doesnt lead to better results
BSSE issue
4.Nonlocalized:Advantages 
Use HF forces (cheap)
Easier IntegrationFFT easyNo Exchange terms
No Correlation Methods
More accurate w/more computationBSSE is not an issue
5.Nonlocalized:Disadvantages 
Must treat empty spaceMust use pseudo potentials

Start out with high temperature and then cool slowly by decreasing T.
Designed by Kirpatrick, Gelati, Vecchi (Science 220 671 1983)
Optimizing highly nonlinear complicated functions.
Essentially, anneal slowly and thus lower the system to minimums.

12.Combined Spin and Spatial Functions 
Now that we have the electronic and spatial wave functions, we combine to get a
complete trial wave function for helium.
1(  1 2) =
2(1)(2) [ (1)(2)(1)(2)]
Note that (1)(1)dr =(2)(2)dr = 1 from the overlap integral
S=abd( r)
13.Hydrogen Gas 
Valence bond theory, so valence bond wave function.
Choose a trial wave function (Heiter and London).
 =
a(1) b(2) or b(1) a(2)
So, we need to create an overall antisymmetric wave function of both electronic
and spatial wave functions.
1 1 = [ a(1) b(2) + b(1) a(2)]
2(( x 2)( x 1)) 
2 + 2S2 x1)( x 2)(
which is overall antisymmetric (both spatially and electronically).

The spatial orbital section is symmetric, and the electronic orbitals areantisymmetric. A symmetric function times a antisymmetric function leads to an
overall anti symmetric function.This is essentially a linear combination of spatial orbitals (1) and (2).</text>

If we multiply out the spatial terms, we get the following.
a(1) a(2) + b(1) b(2) + a(1) a(2) + b(1) a(2)
The rst two terms are ionic because both electrons are centered on 1 atom.
The 2nd two terms are covalent, as the electrons are shared. Unfortunately, if
we maintain this balance, this implies that ioniccovalent characteristics shouldoccur 50/50. This is obviously not the case. Thus, a fudge factor can be used to
reduce the ionic content of the wave function. Then we can solve variationally.Typically, is set to 0.26.</text>

NOTE: the solution neglects or doesnt include the eects of spin.
7.Spin 
Electrons have an intrinsic spin +/1 or. This spin is a consequence of the SE2 
in its relativistic formulation, i.e. the Dirac equation. Thus, degeneracy of the
atomic orbitals exists.
Letbe the spin coordinate. 
x= ( r, ).

this instead.
10 =

Which is antisymmetric AND coupled.
A more convenient format is a slater determinant.

7.Experimental Comparisons 
HF generally overestimates the vibrational frequencies by 10%  heuristic rule.
We can correct via scale factor, which is typically set to 0.84.
HF geometries are generally pretty good to within 0.01

3.Intro Concepts 
 Model electrons quantum mechanically (QM) while using classical mechanics
(CM) for the nuclei.
 In todays research, 50 atom QM simulations is the high end.
 Goal: Solve for nuclear/electron interactions.
 Option 1: Nuclei with an electron cloud in a cluster model isolated system.
 Option 2: Physics approach  periodic structure in 3D.
4.Setup 
 BornOppenheimer (BO) Approximation... Important! Also called the
adiabatic approximation. Essentially, the nuclei are far heavier and less mobilethan electrons. Thus, we can decouple the motions of the electrons from that ofthe nuclei and solve independently.
 Because of BO approximation, we treat nuclei as point charges of zero volume.
 Typically, this means were working in a 3N6 dimensional space, where N 
# of Nuclei in our system.

2.Basis Sets

Localized basis sets (what gaussian uses)
Nonlocalized basis sets (plane waves)
frequencies are much less sensitive to basis sets than the energy
Zero point energy is a destabilizer.

LCAO choose a basis set for each atom and sum them for the molecular 
basis set.

STO3Gs almost never used as its HIGHLY INADEQUATE.
Why? Too small, no robust to chem changing environments, and they dont treat

Solution? Better to express orbitals as summation of diuse and contracted
functions.

coecients are found by minimization of the total hartreefock energy of the
atoms.
So optimized for hartreefock, but still is no anisotropy taken into account.
5.Polarization Functions (631G* and 631G**) 
Polarization functions are important for polar moleculesThey allow for nonuniform displacement of charge around nucleousinclude functions of higher angular momentums + p = hybrid sp orbitalterm used to strike a balance between ratio of s and p.
Examples 631G* and 631G***

** 2nd star means p functions to hydrogen and helium. Optimized to HF

 designed for correlation coecients found by minimizing atomic
MP2 energies.
6.Diffuse Functions (321+G*, 631+G*, 321++G*, 631++G*) 
Previous basis sets designed for systems w/relatively tight bound electrons (ie not
anions) + means adding additional s and p functions optimized for depronated
hydrides (Li
 andBeH).
K KKK
++, 2nd plus means adding diuse functions to H, 1st plus means diuse
functions on nonH atoms.
K
 is the diuse functions, K is more diuse.
Note: Absolute energies are far from conserved, binding energies are much closer
to convergence.
631++ G** is still not big enough. Additional functions (typically higher order
angular momentum functions)
631++G(3df,3pd) adds higher orbital angular momentums.</text>

Term 1 is the energy of a single electron. Term 2 is the coulomb interaction
between electron 1 and 2. Term 3 is the exchange energy term.
 The exchange energy term is a result of using the slater determinant, which
deals with the exchange of electrons. This is a correction to the mean eld term.
 To note, when a=b, the last terms cancel out.
7.Symbolic Notation 
The above was a complete mess, to simplify well use the following notation.
 ZkThe single electron term h(1) =12 
2 1  r1k 
The coloumb term: Jb(1) a(1) = [d b(2)r1b(2)] a(1) x2 
12 
The exchange term: Kb(1) a(1) = [ d b(2)r1a(2)] b(1) x2 
12 
Condense further to symbolic notation.
Eo=a&lt; a|h|a &gt;+1 &lt; ab||ab &gt;2 ab
And this is equivalent to the entire mess is the previous section.Lets expand the last term just to be clear.
1 &lt; ab||ab &gt; =1 [aa|bb] [ab |ba]2 ab 2 ab  In usage, this would appear as [h(1) + Jb(1) Kb(1)] a(1) = aa(1)b=a
and the term in brackets is called the fock operator.

The major problem left to deal with is the fact that 1(x 1)2(x 2) is symmetric in
regards to exchange of electron positions. Thus, we need to make it
antisymmetric by converting via a slater determinant.

Initially, used to optimize the wave function and move nuclei at the same time.Uses a variety of solver algorhythms like velocity verlet
CP equations use a ctitious mass, that is the trick.
In MD, there is a period of time, called equilibration time, where the system isin a nonphysical state due to the initial input coordinate and velocity guesses putin by the user.After that, the system is equilibrated and useful measurements can then be taken
on the system.

From variational principle, we know that  =  unless v(r) v(r) = constant or
0.Assume its not true for .
E[H] = H &lt;H
E &lt; E+ (v(r) v(r))(r )dr
Do the same for E
E &lt; E + (v (r) v(r))(r )dr
Which results in E+E &lt; E+E and that cant happen.
So, we cant get the same from 2 dierent external potentials.</text>

MP2, 2nd order comes from double excitations.
4.MP vs. HF comparisons 
How does it stack up? Gaussian can do up to MP5
Relative Timing on methylamonium with (631G* Basis Set)
HF 1.0 (reference state)
MP2 1.5
MP3 3.6
MP4 5.8
So, less than an order of magnitude dierence in time scale.
Why is it not more expensive? Hartree mean eld is essentially double counting,
which MP eliminates.

All energies are in hartrees. Experimental zero point corrected energy is 57.2
hartree.
Need to subtract o zero point energy data from bond vibrations.
CO hartree theory completely messes up the dipole moment, even predicts the
opposite sign!
6.Density Functional Theory  DFT 
In hartree theory, we have minimized the energy functional E[] = if ( r) is the
external potential (nuclei), it denes the hamiltonian for an N electron system.
Question, can we express E in terms of ( r) such that E=E[]?
First Thereom. (HohenbergKohn, 1964)
v( r), and thus the many body ground state (no excited states) is determined
uniquely by ( r) for an Nelectron nondegenerate system (within a trivial
additive constant).
If we know (r) of the ground state, then we know v(r) and ground state energy,
as well as all other measurable properties.
The proof is in the pudding... or in the rst section of the paper.
Essentially, its not possible to give 2 dierent v(r)s for the same potential well.
