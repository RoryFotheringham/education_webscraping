Definitions of Games 
In-class writing assignment 9/12/06 
 
For this week you read a series of definitions of  games from theorists an d designers Jesper Juul, 
Greg Costikyan, Mark Wolf, and Roger Caillois. You also watched and talked about a slew of 
historical games in lab from a variety of genres from text-adventure to Super NES to a 
contemporary casual MMO. 
 
For class today, Id like you to ruminate a bit more on how you define what counts as a 
videogame. Reflecting on Juuls argument that  todays videogames are based on and evolved 
from  classic game models to Wolfs glossary-l ike classification of game genres, can it be 
said that there is such thing as  a definition of videogames? Juul claims, for example, that it is 
possible to talk about what a game is and what its not. Can we also say what a videogame is and 
what its not? 
 
In small groups of no more than four, I woul d like you to work on this question together. You 
may begin any way you like, but I suggest you start with Juuls helpful list of game definitions 
and go from there. Your goal with  this exercise is to, as a gr oup, write a 50-word definition of 
the term videogame. And yes, when I say 50 wo rds, I mean 50 words. Feel free to tweak and 
revise your language as required. The 51st word will meet a terrible fate!   
 
This assignment will be collected at the end of  class and will be grad ed. Definitions will be 
evaluated based on the following criteria: 
 Effectiveness of group work (as observed in class) 
 Use of assigned readings  and support materials 
 Well-roundedness of definition 
 
Please make sure all the names of your group are on the assignment when you turn it in. 
 
You may use any resources available to you in class, including the read ings for class, the 
interweb, phonecalls to friends, your TA, visiting other groups for help and advice, and 
even dictionary.com if you need it. 
 
There are several options for this, so keep in  mind that you might want to define the term 
videogame by its form, its rules or system of play, its principles, its medium or interface, its 
consequences,  
 
There will be a prize for the group that comes up with the best defin ition. TA and I will 
judge them and will distribute a prize to that group on Thursday.  
 
Have fun!</text>

Narratology &amp; Ludology Assignment 
Videogame Theory &amp; Analysis Course 
 
For this week, we are examining what is now co nsidered to be a red he rring in the field of 
videogame studies: the so-calle d narratology vs. ludology debate. For many games scholars, 
the notion that games ought toindeed, even can bedefined singularly as either interactive 
narratives or by their structural ac tivities is a silly question to begi n with. It depends on context, 
perspective, genre, and a whole host of other variables, depending upon the research question. 
Trying to define what a videogame is based on singul ar criteria ignores all of the situational and 
contextual factors that are key to th is nascent and ever-changing medium. 
 
For class today, Id like you to figure out for yourselves why the current trend in games 
scholarship is to reject the narratology/l udology debate. You will work on a group exercise 
whereby you build on your knowledge and experience with last weeks re adings and activities 
and apply this weeks theories as well.  
 
The Activity 
In groups of no more than three, I want you (as a group) to choose one of the following 
perspectives: 
 
 Player or Player Community 
 Designer/Developer/Programmer 
 Film/Literature/Media Scholar (i.e., narratologist) 
 Traditional Game Scholar (i.e., ludologist) 
 
Your goal is to write a short argument that will be  presented to the class at 12:00 that will make 
the case for studying games from your perspective. Y our goal is to persuade the rest of the class 
that your perspective is the right one and is the most versatile and pervasive definition of 
games that we have. 
 
In your argument, you should cite authors read for this week (Frasca, Juul, Jenkins, Matteas &amp; 
Stern) AND at least 1-2 videogames that help support your point. 
 
The goals and objectives for this exercise are to make a solid argument from your perspective, to 
cite examples and theory from the text, and to  apply that argument to one or two games.  
 
Good luck and have fun!</text>

          <text>I would like for us to do an in -class analysis of a couple of games that we think deserve 
some attention from the perspective of diffe rence and diversity in games and the game 
industry. 
 
We've talked about a lot of games in our discussions: WoW, Princess Peach, Metroid, 
Final Fantasy, and the genre of first-person shooters. 
 
In this class, we will focus a little more closely on looking at 1-3 games in-depth. My intent here is not to have us "deconstruct"  the games. Rather, I'd like us to perform a 
more focused discussion of what we notice, why we notice it, and wh at we think is worth 
further discussion. 
 
I need a couple of volunteers to bring in some games that we can examine. They can be games that you thought of when doing the readings on gender and race, or they can be games that we haven't yet discussed. It mi ght be worth, for example, looking at Second 
Life and seeing what Amanda saw when she first got on, or perhap s talking about the 
PMS crew that Matt mentioned when he spoke of Halo 2. 
 
The questions I'd like us to examine are: 
 
 What do we notice about the "representati onal" elements of each game? In other 
words, how are race, gender, and differe nce being represented by BOTH the art 
AND the structure and design of the game? 
 What can we say about the cultural influen ce of the game in terms of play styles 
and diversity? Does the game make an effo rt to be culturally re levant to different 
players and their needs? How? Why? 
 Assuming that games are relevant texts in today's popular culture landscape, can 
we determine what, if any, "message" is being conveyed by these important texts? Is that message significant? Why or why not?</text>
