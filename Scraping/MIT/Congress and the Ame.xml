          <text>Problems Thinking about Campaign Finance  
 Antiincumbency/politician hysteria 
 Problem of strategic behavior 
 Why the no effects finding of $$ 
 What we want to know: 
 Why do politicians need campaign $$ and how much is enough 
 Does private money buy access or 
 Why do people contribute to campaigns? 
 What do MCs do in return for $$? 
 How do principals respond to changes in circumstances

          <text>Problems with Particular Reforms  
 Spending limits:
 Generally favors incumbents 
 Generally unconstitutional 
 Limit activities of non candidates 
 Encourages shifting to other behaviors 
 Generally unconstitutional 
 Subsidies (free TV, etc.)
 Is this enough? 
 Do we want more TV? 
 Does anyone watch TV? 
 Public Financing
 Citizens dont like paying for politics 
 People can still opt out 
 Disclosure 
 Intimidation?

          <text>Where we are 
 Supreme Court has generally 
 Rejected efforts to equalize elections through campaign finance laws 
 Rejected efforts to regulate what campaigns do with their money (s.t. bribery 
laws, etc.) 
 Rejected efforts to limit what people/ groups/ corporations can do with their 
own money if it doesnt coordinate with candidates 
 Accepted (for now) reasonable contribution limits 
 Accepted (for now) registration and reporting requirements

What good does it do? 
 Where does it go? 
 Safe incumbents: consumption 
 Unsafe incumbents: campaign (media, etc.) 
 Everyone else: Campaign activities 
 To what effect? 
 The paradox of the spendthrift incumbent

While state officials have suffered legal setback s in North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin  here 
federal courts restored some early-voting opportun ities, seen as beneficial to African Americans 
 only North Carolina has tried to get the Supr eme Court to put the lower-court decisions on 
hold. But without Scalia, who died in February, to  provide a fifth vote for conservatives, the 
high court deadlocked 4 to 4 and the lower-court rulings remained in place.

Though it is rare for a sitting Supreme Court justice to become 
chief justice, she said, Bush might go for O'Connor because 
she doesn't pose a threat to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion. 
Bush might like the idea of having O'Connor, the swing vote 
on the court, as chief justice for just two to three years, after 
which she likely would retire -- giving the Republican president another crack at altering the court's makeup, Totenberg said.

To be sure, the chief justice considers himself the custodian of the Supreme Courts prestige, 
authority and legitimacy , and he is often its voice in major cases. There was reason, then, to 
think he might have provided a sixth vote to uphold the law had Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
joined the courts four-member liberal wing. That would have allowed Chief Justice Roberts, the 
thinking went, to write a narrow , grudging major ity opinion. But almost no one thought that he 
would provide the fifth vote, joining only the lib erals, to uphold a Democratic presidents signal 
legislative achievement. 
 The court Chief Justice Roberts leads is not leaving the national spotlight. The next term already 
includes a major case on affirmative action in higher education, and cases on voting rights and 
same-sex marriage are likely to follow. All will test the chief justices leadership, and the novel 
alignment in Thursdays case is unlikely to be rep eated. In cases concerning the role of race in 
admissions and voting, he is likely to take his usual place with the courts conservatives . In 
cases on gay rights, Justice Kennedy is likely to be the swing vote.

In seven years on the Supreme Court, Justice An thony M. Kennedy has been neither ideological 
leader nor political strategist. His writings have drawn little attention from law reviews, and it is 
part of court lore that he's so little known a group of tourists once asked him to take their picture. 
While Kennedy may lack the bold personality or compelling background of other justices, 
he has earned one important distinction: On a closely divided court, he holds the decisive 
vote. 
Along with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Kennedy will be the justice to watch as the court 
in the weeks ahead 
decides major cases involving free speech rights, the separation of church 
and state and the constitutionality of government  policies based on race. More often than 
O'Connor, however, it is Kennedy who casts the fifth -- and deciding -- vote and in recent years 
he has been in the majority on important cases more than any other justice. 
Many of Kennedy's prominent "fifth votes" have led to liberal rulings. But Kennedy is overall a 
conservative jurist, refusing to expand the role of the courts in American life and believing 
social policy is best left to elected officials.

While state officials have suffered legal setback s in North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin  here 
federal courts restored some early-voting opportun ities, seen as beneficial to African Americans 
 only North Carolina has tried to get the Supr eme Court to put the lower-court decisions on 
hold. But without Scalia, who died in February, to  provide a fifth vote for conservatives, the 
high court deadlocked 4 to 4 and the lower-court rulings remained in place.

          <text>Ryan, who chairs the House Budget Commi ttee, has long been expected to lead the 
GOPs legislative push next year to reform the U.S. tax code, and has been hinting at his 
playbook in interviews this month. 
Brady said that he has raised more than $4 million ahead of the midterm elections, citing 
his combined fundraising for his political action committee, his House campaign, and the 
National Republican Congressional Committee. He called his haul a sign of his ability to raise money for committee members 
The expectations are very high for the next chairman, both on policy and on financial 
support for others, Brady said. Im determined to exceed every one of those expectations. 
Ryan is one of the GOPs most prolific fundraisers. He has millions in his campaign 
account and over the summer he donated more than $1 million to the NRCC. Brady said Thursday that he would match Ryan and co mmitted to give $1 million to the NRCC as 
Novembers elections neared.

          <text>Some Comments About This View
 Why its called the gains from trade view
 Majoritarian objection very clear from the 
out of the Pareto set result in the 
example
 Nonetheless, if the majoritarian objection 
doesnt hold, this is an attractive descriptive view of much of policymaking + an explanation for why everyone can be dissatisfied with the current state of policy

          <text>Moving To and Fro
 If there are property rights in committee 
seats, then a transfer reveals a preference 
for Committeenewover Committeeold
 This gives rise to independent measures 
of committee value (see table 8-6)

          <text>Application of Setter Model to 
Committees
 Easy to think of committees as providing take it 
or leave it propositions and being composed of 
high demanders
 deference to committees
 Supposed self-selection on committees
 Problems with this view
 high demand committees hard to sustain in a 
majoritarian institution
 Empirical evidence mixed
 Amendment opportunities galore
 Status quo rarely so Draconian

          <text>Gatekeeping
 Gatekeeping is the right of a committee to
decide to keep an item off the floor if it
doesnt want action.
Usually thought of in a majoritarian setting
 Example:
 Classic case:  Civil Rights legislation

          <text>Chairs
 
	 Seniority system:  the practice of reserving the chairs of 
committees for the most senior member (on that committee) 
	 Result of revolt against Cannon 
	 Senate:  pretty inviolate until recently, with bidding (+ 6-yr term 
limit for Rs) 
 Senate Byrd/Biden shuffle (next slide) 
 114th Congress: committees choose their chairs, ratified by the
Conference 
	 House 
 Democrats in 1970s put chairs up to confirmatory vote 
	 2008 deposition of Dingell by Henry Waxman similar to Les Aspins deposition of 
Melvin Price in 1985 
	 Scrapped term limits in 2008; currently agitation to bring them back. 
 Republicans 
	 1970s put ranking members up to confirmatory vote 
	 1994: term limits (6 years) plus vote of caucus

          <text>How Committee members are 
chosen
 
 Party committees make choices 
 House tends to rely on party committees 
 Senate tends to go by seniority 
	 Republicans pure seniority 
	 Democrats weight seniority highest 
 Formal and informal constraints 
 Property rights in committee assignments ar ose around the turn of the last century 
 Allocation restrictions 
	 Senate 
	 Johnson rule most famous 
 All junior senators get one good assignment before a s enior senator gets a second 
	 Rules, create A, B, and C committees* 
 A: Agriculture; Appropriations ; Armed Services ; Banking; Commerce; Energy; Environment; 
Finance ; Foreign Relations; HELP; Homeland Security; Judiciar y; Select Intelli gence [limit of 
2] 
 B: Budget; Rules and Administration; Small Business; Veterans A ffairs; Special Aging; JEC

 Problems with view
 Majoritarian objection (again)
 The Senate, especially, has ways around 
committees
 Other ways around gatekeeping
 Discharge
 speaker discharge
 Committee changes in House since 1994 have

	 State legislative elections often brought about
chaotic balloting
	 Stories of corruption in Senate elections led to
Progressive calls for reform
Rise of third parties gave major parties an  
incentive to create a duopoly of power  
	 17th amendment: popular election of

visible practical application of the  
unidimensional spatial model  
 Because groups pick divisive roll call votes, 
the interest group ratings tend to be more bimodal than reality. 
 Ratings like Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder are better, because they are based on (almost) all roll calls

          <text>4. Committee reports are important---
and controversial 
Committee reports, floor speeches, and even colloquies between 
Congressmen  are frail substitutes for bicameral vote upon the text of a law and its presentment to the President. Thompson v. 
Thompson, 484 U.S. 174, 191-192 (1988)(Scalia, J., concurring). 
In my view a law means what its text most appropriately 
conveys, whatever the Congress that enacted it might have intended. The law is what the law says, and we should 
content ourselves with reading it rather than psychoanalyzing those who enacted it. Bank One of Chicago v. Midwest Bank 
and Trust Co., 516 U.S.264,279 (1996).

          <text>3. The most important thing about bill 
referral is that it usually determines  
who the bills murderer is.  
As a rule, a bill committed is a bill doomed. When it goes from 
the Clerks desk to a committee-room it crosses a parliamentary bridge of sighs to dim dungeons of silence when it will never return. The means and time of its death are unknown but its friends never see it again. --Woodrow Wilson, Congressional Government

Unanimous Consent Agreements 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1191 
M r . McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, with the concurrence 
of the Democratic leader, the Senate pro ceed to vote on the motion to proceed to cal endar No. 30, H.R. 1191, and that if the mo tion to 
proceed is agreed to, Senator Corker or his designee be recognized to offer a substitute  amendment, which is the text of S. 615 as 
reported by the Foreign Relations Committee.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? 
 The minority leader. 
 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve my right to object,  [say s nice things about Democrats involved in negotiating the bill.] B ut we 
are not there yet. Remember, we had a problem with this initially  because of the language in the bill. So every word is going to have to 
be read with this new language that is dr awn up, and then we will see if  we can make it to the fini sh line. I think we can, but  we are 
certainly not there yet. But progress has been made. [More kind words for Senators Cardin and Corker]  But I note that the majority leader is once again choosing not to  move to the nomination of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General.  It has 
been more than 5 months--it will be 6 mont hs in a week or 10 days--since President Obama nominated her. Her nomination has been  on 
the Senate calendar for 49 days, longer than the last 7 Attorney General nominations combined. 
[Asks that the Lynch nomination be added to the UA] 
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majo rity leader so modify his request? 
M r . McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I have indicated, gosh, at least for 6 weeks now, we are goi ng to deal with the Lynch nomination 
right after we finish trafficking. [Say more things about getting the trafficking bill passed.]  Therefore, I object to the modification. 
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objecti on to the modification is heard. 
 Mr. REID. Mr. President, conti nuing my reservation, [capitulates]. 
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

          <text>2014: District 4  
(Central Valley)   
In District 4, incumbent Rep. Tom McClintock made the 
runoff with fellow Republican Art Moore. McClintock is a 
conservative and friend of the tea party, while his challenger has positioned himself as the moderate alternative --a reverse of the establishment v. tea party 
narrative that has plagued this primary cycle. 
If McClintock wins, however, Rarick* says, the system 
didn't work.

 Cut lines should be distributed ~ ideal points 
 The median should win the most often 
 If the majority party keeps motions off the 
agenda that split the majority, then 
 Motions will not be distributed ~ ideal points

          <text>It would, doubtless, be considered quite impr oper to omit from an essay on the Senate 
all mention of the Senate's President; and yet there is very little to be said about the 
Vice-President of the United States. His position is one of anomalous insignificance and 
curious uncertainty. Apparently he is not, strictly speaking, a part of the legislature,he is clearly not a member,yet neither is he an officer of the executive. It is one of the remarkable things about him, that it is hard to find in sketching the government any proper place to discuss him. He comes in mo st naturally along with the Senate to which 
he is tacked; but he does not come in there for any great consideration. He is simply a 
judicial officer set to moderate the proceedings of an assembly whose rules he has had no voice in framing and can have no voice in changing. His official stature is not to be compared with that of the Speaker of the H ouse of Representatives. So long as he is 
Vice-President, he is inseparable officially from the Senate; his importance consists in the fact that he may cease to be Vice-President. His chief dignity, next to presiding over the Senate, lies in the circumstance that he is awaiting the death or disability of the 
President. And the chief embarrassment in discu ssing his office is, that in explaining how 
little there is to be said about it one has evidently said all there is to say.

 After the Civil War, they do (first the House, then the Senate) 
 Even so, party control of committees is a 20
th century 
phenomenon 
 Over time formal party positions have 
proliferated and institutionalized 
 Institutionalization mostly a 20th century phenomenon

F r o m  1 5th amendment 
	 The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall note be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition 
of servitude. 
 Voting Rights Act of 1965 
	 Prevented dilution 
	 Section 2:  General prohibition against discrimination 
	 Section 5:  Pre-clearance for covered jurisdictions 
	 covered jurisdictions must demonstrate that a proposed voting change does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of 
discriminating based on race or color. 
	 1980: Mobile v. Bolden 
	 S.C. says you have to show intent 
	 1982: VRA extension allows effect 
	 1990: Justice dept. moved to requiring maximizing minority representation through
pre-clearance 
	 2013: Shelby County v. Holder
	 Section 4b [coverage formula] unconstitutional, thus Section 5 unenforceable 
	 Section 2 still in force (probably) 
	 Effect greatest in non-districting cases 
	 Possible effects on redistricting going forward

Near this site stood the home of state senator Israel 
Thorndike, a merchant and privateer. During a visit here in 1812 by Governor Elbridge Gerry, an electoral district was oddly redrawn to provide advantage to the party in office. Shaped by political intent rather than any natural boundaries, its appearance resembled a salamander. A frustrated member of the opposition party called it a gerrymander, a term still in use today.

          <text>Method of equal proportions  
Results in a listing of the states according to a priority
value--calculated by dividing the population of each stateby the geometric mean of its current and next seatsthatassigns seats 51 through 435.
Practically:  This method assigns seats in the House ofRepresentatives according to a priority value. Thepriority value is determined by multiplying the populationof a state by a multiplier. For example, following the1990 census, each of the 50 states was given one seat outof the current total of 435. The next, or 51st seat, went tothe state with the highest priority value and thus becamethat state's second seat.
