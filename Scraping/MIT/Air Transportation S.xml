Background
 Many bird species fly in V formation to take advantage of the 
up-wash field generated by adjacent birds, resulting in less 
energy expended.
 Analytical studies and recent AFF flight tests validate these 
observations.
AFF Objectives
 Validate drag reduction concept and prediction tools of a 
system of aircraft in formation  in the flight environment
 Develop and evaluate sensor and control methodologies for 
autonomous close formation flightApproach
 Flight test autonomous station keeping control laws of pair of F-18 
aircraft.
 Validate drag benefits and wing tip vortex behavior using piloted
flight tests.
 Develop and validate advanced relative GPS system capable of 10
cm relative position accuracy.
 Integrate updated sensors and advanced formation control laws to
perform autonomous station keeping within the vortex wake of a lead aircraft.
Benefits
 Potential commercial fuel savings of $0.5 to 1 million per year per 
trailing aircraft.
 Application to UAV Swarming, &amp; Aerial Refueling.

Rapid Drag Increase
Larger sweet spotFlight Test Theoretical
Hammer home that this is INDUCED drag!
The flight results also measure higher drag increases inboard than predicted, but this is also the region where data quality is worse b ecause the points are more difficult to fly. Some of these points
were very unstable as the vortex seemed to impinge on the tail or other surfaces causing the trailing aircraft to continually wander from  the target position. Higher trim drag effects could
also contribute to the large drag increases. The line of zero benefit is also located further outboard than predicted. These results i ndicate substantially higher sensitivity to lateral positioning
inboard of the sweet spot than predicted. Small changes in lateral positioning in this region can result in large changes in benefits (drag increase!). The overall vertical se nsitivity
is less than predicted; the overall shape of the region of most benefit is more round than oval as predicted for a generic wing. Induced dra g results are similar at all flight
conditions and separation distances:
The induced drag change measured at the transport flight condition (not presented) correlated very well to those obtained at the referen ce condition shown above in both shape and magnitude.  This
is a significant result indicating an accurate model of induced drag change could potentially be used to model drag benefits at other con ditions.</text>

          <text>Overview
Autonomous Formation Flight: NASA RevCo Program
Boeing is currently engaged with NASA Dryden Flight Research Center on a technically
ambitious project, Autonomous Formation Flight (AFF).  The projects primary goal is to
investigate potential benefits of flying aircraft in the aerodynamic wake vortex emanating
from a lead aircrafts wing tip.  Initial analytic studies predict that a trailing aircraft may
experience drag reductions of 10% or more by gaining additional lift in the updraft portion ofthe leads wake vortex.  The technical challenge is to be able to find the optimal position
within the vortex to fly, then hold that position consistently in what is an extremely turbulent
flow field. We know that pilots have been able to do this in the past, but the task involves a
very high workload.
The Autonomous Formation Flight system marries an extremely robust flight control and
guidance system with a close-coupled GPS/IMU placed on two F-18s. Inter-ship
communication allows the multiple GPS/IMU systems to share state data and through and
extended Kalman filter technique, they yield a differential carrier phase solution. They
resolve the relative position accuracy between the aircraft in formation to less than 10 cm.
Through shared state data, the guidance systems aboard both F-18s resolve coordinated
trajectories that permit the aircraft to maintain formation.  The trailing aircraft is thus capableof maintaining its position within the lead aircrafts wing tip vortex with extremely high
accuracy.
The implications and applications of this technology are far reaching, not just for fuel
economy but for other future applications such as aerial refueling, aircraft logistics, air traffic
control, and carrier landing systems.

 Pilot workload assessments
 They found that maintaining the minimum drag 
formation was a comparable workload to maintaining other types of formations. (not a good thing)
 The longest duration the pilots could maintain the 
position operationally was approximately 20-30 minutes.

          <text>Supply Chain
The supply chain refers to all the steps in the transport 
process in which the goods are out of service 
So ICC applies to all of the inventory in the supply  chain
In transit
Waiting between transport modes
At the origin being built up
At the destination being broken down
In the store until sold
An alternate definition of supp ly chain may include all the time
your money is out of service
Some companies pay for the goods before they are manufactured</text>

          <text>Node Number
Total Distribution Cost is influenced by the number of nodes (por ts, distribution 
centers, stores, etc)
Fewer nodes result in more freq uent service and/or larger vehicles
In the case of ships, fewer por ts means that the cargo must travel far ther on more 
expensive trucks or  trains
Number of ports must balance the value of f requent service and  larger vehicles with the 
increased cost of surface transport
Casual observati on indicates a te ndency to ward few, ma jor ports
In the case of airplanes, fewer air ports  means the cargo must travel far ther in slower 
surface vehicles
Must balance value of frequen cy of service and vehicle size with slower delivery
Note that for airliners there are approximately one zillion airports worldwide
The number for cargo i s much l ess because cost is more important than time
Route structure design can improve schedule frequen cy by comb ining loads
In the case of distribution center s, fewer, larger  centers  are more efficient and require 
less safety stock (lower variab ility), but are farther from their customers
Cargo transport into distribution centers is typically less expensive that cargo going out
Packag ing efficie ncy, va riation due to quantity
The size and/or  number  of nodes may incr ease over  time as traffic increases</text>

          <text>Comments on Cargo Rates
Rates dec line with range
Much of indirect operating cost is independent of range
Cargo handling, sales costs dont depend on range
So indirect cost per mile  is less at greater ranges
Ships are much less expens ive than airplanes
Ships are very efficient:  L/D ~400
Ships indirect costs are much less than airplanes
Large c ontainer s, mechanized loading
Trend curves can be approximated by a simple formula
Rate = cost/ton-nm + cost/ton
Cost/nm can be t hought of as DOC
Fixed cost can be thought of as IOC 
Scatter in rates due to two factors
Asymmetrical demand (east versus west for instance)
Airplane main deck pays full rate, belly cargo rides for ~IOC,</text>

          <text>Vehicle Size
In transport systems, bigger is usually more efficient
Ships:
Volume/wetted area; Reynolds number ; Froude number
Faster and more efficient
More cargo per  crew
Airplanes:
Volume/wetted area; Reynolds number
More cargo per  crew
Structur al penalty of large size (w ing bending mostly) is offset by other  
benefits (compact fuselage)
Howev er, large size implies lower schedule frequency
Optimum system must balance transport cost reduction of larger vehicle 
with reduced inventory of smaller vehicle
Because airplanes generally carry goods wi th greater  value or  ICC, they will 
tend to be smaller  than ships
As world traffic increases, vehicles tend to increase in size</text>

          <text>Introduction
The cargo world attempts to solve a very complex 
mission (problem)
This presentation outlines the elements of the problem 
but does not define a specific mission
I have been trying to understand this subject for a few 
years now
I may only be a few week s ahead of you (if that)! 
This presentation is non-linear
Requires integration by the student after the fact
Military and commercial needs are similar in structure
Widely different values
Military values very dependent on situation</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>6</slideno>
          <text>Depreciation
Depreciation is the most powerful and variable factor in ICC
Depreciation refers to loss of potential value over time
Depreciation may not be linear at all
Seasonal variation
If you get the air condition ers in one month late they may be on the shelves for 10 
months  very expensive
Lots of stuff is seasonal!
Spoilage
Food is worth l ess than  nothing after it spoils
Depreciation may pertain to loss of value in the larger system, not just the 
cargo proper
Airplane on ground, factor y halted, troops die, etc
Obsolescence and Hits
Rapid technical change can cause high depreciation
Michael Dell says his comp uters depreciate 1%/ week!
Inability to deliver  a hit pr oduct will result in a loss of sales
Military version of obsolescenc e and hits per tains to war
Value of time can be v ery, very great in wartime</text>

          <text>Cargo Airplanes
I suspect that your analysis will show that cargo 
airplanes have a substantially different mission than 
passenger airplanes
In the past, commercial cargo airplanes were derived 
from airliners to save development cost
It may be now that the cargo ma rket can support a purpose-built 
cargo airplane
Your analysis may show that a low cargo rate is more 
important than speed
This requires an emphas is on low DOC and IOC 
Note that speed is good for productivity and therefore DOC
What airplane type provides the lowest cargo rate?</text>

          <text>General Solution
Provides overall production/transport architecture to 
maximize an economic measure
This optimization results in the need for global 
distribution of goods
System seeks a balance betw een production and transport 
costs:
Low-cost or expert labor
Mass production
Product type consolidation (cars in Detroit, movies in LA)
Farmland
Proximity to market
Good transport system access
Etc
Production and distribution are a linked system</text>

          <slideno>14</slideno>
          <text>Inventory Drivers
Frequency of service
More frequent service reduces in ventory at origin and destination
Reduc es period between asynchronous transport modes
Reliability of service from a schedule standpoint
Vehicle may be late
Vehicle may not be available (full)
Reliable service permits reduced safety stock
Uncertain ship availability drives shippers crazy
Variability of demand
Predictability of demand

        <slide>
          <slideno>16</slideno>
          <text>Predictability of Demand
Suppliers attempt to match supply to demand at optimum price
Some ar chitectures force long lead times ( time between or der and delivery)
This reduces predictability since market or competition may cha nge in the meantime
Note that lead tim es can be cum ulative
Many products are the su m of n umerous separate products, som etimes s erial
Market serves as feedback for production
Long lag time between pr oduction and ma rket feedback reduc es pr ecision of 
control
Very expensive mi stakes
Exacerbated by seasonal aspect cannot fine-tune over the long run
Some architectures improve responsiveness despite long supply chains
Restaurants: generalized, low-value inv entory  held until the last moment when 
custom product is created
Dell Computer : same as restaur ant
Last minute allocation: Mass order  on ship s, allocated to specific r egions or

          <text>More Observations
It used to be that one went to a store or show to obtain 
information about goods
Information now flows for free via Internet
Often one can find better info on web than in store
This supports global mail order
It may be that the best architecture combines more than 
one system
Slow and cheap plus fast, responsive and expens ive

        <slide>
          <slideno>28</slideno>
          <text>Some Observations
The value of speed comes from:
Reduc ed time in transit
The ability to reorganize architecture
Its not just the long trip that hurts.  Its also the slow 
feedback loop.
Between demand and supply
Seasonal or time-sensitive demand exacerbates this
Fast transit can tighten the feedback loop
Fast transit can permit customer to obtain goods from 
greater distance with acceptable delay

          <text>How to Determine Cargo Mission Needs
Examine current production/transport/c ustomer system in a field of 
interest.
Evaluate value and ICC of goods, cost of system
Generate alternative system architectures
Include production, transport and customer characteristics
Generate alternative transport vehicles
Evaluate alternative system architectures
Primarily against total economic performance
Consider applications of the architecture beyond your chosen field, 
especially for the vehicle
Consider the future
Consider what competition can do to you
Choos e the best one
This defines your mission</text>

          <text>Inventory
Inventory is expensive
Typically 25% of value per year
Inventory performs several functions:
Buffer between a relatively steady production and an intermittent 
transport
Safety stock to assure an acceptable level of service 
(acceptable likelihood of deliv ery)
A function of system schedule reliability
Also a function of variability and predictability of demand
Buffer to connect two asynchronous transport modes
Buffer to build inventory sufficient for efficient transport
Between transport modes
There is room for improvement in reducing inventory
Perfect knowledge would be a good start</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>7</slideno>
          <text>Cost of Transport
Cost of transport is split into two parts:
Direct operating cost
Indirect operating cost
Direct operating cost pertains to vehicle operation
Fuel, crew, vehic le deprec iation, maintenance, etc
Indirect operating cost pertains to other costs
Sales, cargo handling, adm inistration, profit, etc
Sum of direct and indirect operating costs is cargo rate</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>15</slideno>
          <text>Variability
Variability in demand influenc es supply  chain architecture
Variability is roughly proportional to the square root of the quantity 
involved.  
Large quantities provide proportionally less variability
10/100 versus 100/10,000   (10% versus 1%)
This favors reduced product differentiation, centralized distribution 
centers
However :
Customers prefer differentiated products
Centralized distribution centers have longer delivery distances
Architecture must balance quantity, differentiation and distance
Compare warehouse store with corner hardware store
Compare mail-order with local store
Some organizations use different architecture within same system
High-value goods centralized,  low value goods dispersed</text>

          <text>Transport Problem
The problem pertains to the distribution of non-human 
objects (not electronic information) 
Humans are self-loading car go and are a special case not 
addres sed here
Chief difference between people and cargo is that peoples time is 
generally much more valuable than cargos 
Transoceanic transport:
Cargo: 99% ship, 1% air  (by weight)
People: 1% ship, 99% air   (approximately)
As a result, cargo systems are much different than passenger systems
Addressing the transport problem in isolation from 
production, the object is to obtain the lowest total cost of 
transport</text>

          <text>Total Distribution Cost
Object of logistics systems is to minimize Total 
Distribution Cost (TDC)
TDC is the total cost of transporting goods
Sum of cost of transport and cost of holding inventory
Cost of transport is fees paid to carriers (ship, truck, etc)
Annual cost of inventory is typically a fraction of the 
value of the inventory
This fraction is called Inventory Carrying Cost
Typical fraction is 25%, but depends heavily on actual goods, timing
Diamonds have low ICC, food has high ICC
Consists of interest, depreciation, taxes, insurance, losses, 
warehouses</text>

property that they are relevant to the same 
concerns for a system stakeholder.
A Viewpoint is an abstraction of view across 
many systems.

Quantitative QFD-based approach:
5. Repeat the process iteratively using the system 
design parameters as objectives.  At each stage 
the parameters at the next level up become the 
objectives at the next level down.
6. Continue the process of decomposition on as 
many level as desired.  As detailed designs are 
developed, their parameter value can flow up 
the hierarchy to track estimated performance for 
customer objectives.

Recent Trends in Air Cargo
Rapid growth in demand for air cargo
Intra-Asia is the largest true air freight market
Even during Asian economic crisis air freight traffic grew
Forecasts for continued traffic growth at 6% per year
Falling real yields (revenue per ton-mile)
Average 2.5% decline in yields (CPI adjusted)
Growth in international trade has increased trip length, associated 
with lower tariffs per mile
Wide-body aircraft have unused belly capacity, viewed by 
passenger airlines as virtually costless
Passenger air lines have become pr ice leaders in air  freight
Regulatory liberalization has spurred price competition
Lower tariffs further stimulate demand , but  also cause air lines to focus 
on lowering unit costs</text>

Trends in Air Cargo (contd)
Integrator expansion
Integrated express carriers own air and ground assets to handle 
entire shipment journey
Fedex and UPS, facing competition and decreasing yields in 
express documents, expanded to international markets
With limited international small package growth, carry standard air 
freight (airport to air port) as filler
Trying to develop products for higher-yield industrial traffic
Consolidation of freight forwarders
Non-integrated carriers receive majority of traffic from freight 
forwarders  FFshandle retail marketing and pick-up/delivery
Number of mid-sized freight forwarders has been shrinking, leaving 
largest operators and niche competitors</text>

Constraints on Air Cargo Growth
Economic recession
Reduced production, demand for  goods, international trade
Trade barriers
Tariffs or protectionism designed to limit free trade
Aircraft regulations
Air cargo operators have used older aircraft that are most affected 
by new regulations on noise, emissions and safety
For example, noise hush-kits reduce cargo payloads
Modal competition
Air freight has tremendous speed advantage for long distances, but 
is highest-cost option
Trucks very competitive for short haul (1000 miles, overnight)
Development of new fast ships for ocean cargo</text>

Key Questions
Where can an air cargo carrier reduce cost?
If you could automate aircraft operations, which 
aircraft type would give you the best leverage?
Is there any specific segment of the air cargo market 
that is primed for growth?
How would you grow this market segment?</text>

Drivers of Air Cargo Growth in 1990s
Overall economic growth (especially world trade)
Historically, 2 to 2.5% increase in world trade with each 1% increase 
in total GDP
Air freight trade has been growing even faster, due to regional 
differences in economic growth
Since 1993, average 7-10% annual growth in world air freight traffic
Globalization
Increasingly integrated and interdependent national economies
Liberalized (free) trade and reduced protectionism
Lean Inventory Strategies
Reduced order-cycle times: just in time and make to order
Less stock on hand to avoid production shutdowns, retail stockouts
Air freight shortens delivery times to customer</text>

Demand for Air Cargo Services
Like demand for passenger air travel, demand for air 
cargo shipment is a derived demand.
Primary drivers of air cargo demand include:
Economic growth and trade (especially imports/exports)
Relative prices of air cargo versus alternatives  ocean, truck, rail
Difficult to quantify demand/supply accurately:
No comprehensive sources of data on air cargo traffic and pricing
Lack of published schedule data (unlike passenger airlines)
Vertically integrated air cargo operators (like Fedex and UPS) only 
publish limited schedules for selected flights
All-cargo carriers tend to operate flexibly based on daily/weekly 
demands
Combination carriers provide joint supply of cargo and passenger
capacity</text>

Swarm is naturally stable. If an 
aircraft moves ahead of the flock it 
takes more power and if it moves 
aft it takes less
Stabilit y diminishes at tip. Aircraft Significant ground effect only for 
small heights above ground.

Aerodynamic Basics of Formation Flying*-V
More elaborate vortex wake models agree well with simple horseshoe 
model for two wings and span separations greater than approx 0.25
Trends are ok even for smaller span separations
Three rolled up sheet re sults are for three different vertical separations
Deductions: Want small lateral separations, some vertical separation

Commercial Drivers
Globalization trends
Longer distances between producers and consumers
Emerging markets, e.g. China, South America, Africa
Lean manufacturing
Focus on flow to eliminate waste, e.g. JIT
Faster response to market demands
Air freight operators looking for new markets
Most transoceanic freight shipped by surface
Gap in capability- middle market
Ship is inexpens ive but takes 18-30 days
Air is expens ive but takes only 3-6 days
Operating economics drive
Increased capacity per air freighter
Reduced crew and fuel costs</text>

Class Deliverables
The final deliverables for the class will be a written report and 
accompanying briefing which lays out the feasibility of 
formation flight for long haul cargo aircraft, candidate system 
specifications, and gaps in know ledge needed to realize the 
proposed concept(s). The audien ces for these deliverables are 
decision makers in industry and government, and the engineering 
community as represented by an AIAA technical conference.  
The report should include a one page executive summary, a main 
body of a length and content suitable  for a conference paper, and 
appendices as needed for detailed analysis.

Summary of Drivers
Both commercial and military
Need more weight and volume transported over 
long distances.
Mostly intercontinental
Need block times in days rather than weeks
Ground transport and handling is important
Focus on integrated system, not just aircraft
Need affordable costs
More expensive than surface but less expensive than 
current air</text>

Class Charge
The Spring 2004 16.886 class will investigate the possibility of
exploiting formation flight for significant new capability for 
long haul commercial and military cargo.  All aspects related to
system concepts should be explored including, but not limited 
to, the number and placement of aircraft in a formation, mix of 
aircraft size and payload/fuel fractions, aircraft and formation
stability and control, degree of autonomy, concepts for 
formation rendezvous and dispersal, economic, safety, 
environmental factors, etc.. The size of the class will determine 
the number of topics that will be explored in depth.</text>

Variations on the Theme - I*
 Consider distribution of lift among 
aircraft such that the total formation 
induced drag is minimized.
 Total [induced] drag is minimized 
with an elliptical distribution of 
weight across the formation
 Other interesting results in paper 
about practical implementation for chevron formation
 Paper has nice formulation of 
horseshoe vortex model.

Aerodynamic Basics of Formation Flying*-III
Total power reduction of 
formation of equal size wings as 
a function of lateral spacing 
between the wings.
No vertical separation between 
wings.
Parasite drag as sumed equal to 
induced drag, i.e. maximum 
range c onditions
Total power reduction 10-20% or  
more based upon simple model.
Munks stagger  theorem says 
that total power r eduction does 
not depend upon streamwise
spacing of wings.

Formation Flight - Natures Solution
Principles
Favorable aerodynamic interference
1970 paper by Lissaman and Shollenberger
Est71% increase in range, 24 % reduction in V for 25 birds
Modular approach to scaling
Status
Aerodynamic theory reasonably well developed
Flight tests have demonstrated 12-18% less fuel burn 
for 2 aircraft formations.
Frequently used for military maneuvers
Close aircraft spacing increases pilot workload
Suggest autonomous or semi autonomous system
Little exploration into long-haul applications and 
systems issues.(Image removed due to

Variations on the Theme - II*
Considers both formation 
and ground effects
Calculated formation shape 
yielding equal induc ed drag 
for each aircraft.
Near the tip of the V the 
wings are more abreast than 
near the back
Agrees with Lissaman
and Shollenberger
Not much influence of 
ground effect on formation 
geometry

Allison, et al Expedited Transport Airlines, Final Report for 16.899 
Air Transportation System Architecting.
World air cargo and freight to grow at 6.4-6.5% per year for next 10 
years.
Total worldwide freight shipping expected to go from 132 to 383 Freight-
Ton-Kilometers in 20 years.
Freighter Fleet to grow from 1,775 to 3,078, including retirement of 
1,228 old freighters, mostly narrow body.
Long range freighter segment  will be the fastest growing
Standard shipments take 4-6 days with only 10-15% time in the air. Most 
the time is ground transport, handling, waiting.
Top 10 markets will generate 40% of global airfreight in next 10 years: 
Intra Asia, China Europe, China North America, North America 
Asia, Europe Asia, North America Europe, Domestic USA

Aerodynamic Basics of Formation Flying*-IV
Three different arrangements 
of 15 wings swept 450with 
zero spanwise separation 
All have the same total 
power reduction
Distribution of power 
reduction among the wings is 
different for the three 
formations
Formation A is called a 
Chevron
Formations B, C called a V
This is just one example of 
the many various formation 
geometries possible

Military Drivers
Threats are global
Reaction times are shorter
Trends are towards US basing for security, economic and 
political factors
Result is US forces are becoming more expeditionary
Rumsfelds Transformation goals for Army
Deploy 1 div ision any where in the world in 5 days
Deploy 5 div isions any where in the world in 30 days
Division is 16,000 personnel and all their equipment
Long range bombers based on continental US require 
considerable tanker support which is expensive and 
logistically complicated.

The Jerome C. Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace Systems 
Department of Aeronautical and Astronautic al Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology 
 
BIOGRAPHY  
 
Dr. Leopold had led the Arizona-based licen sing and technology transfer business for 
Motorola Corporate Technology when he retired  in 2003.  He had previously served as the 
Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the Globa l Telecom Solutions Sector ($6B sales and 
20,000 people in 2001), and prior to that assi gnment had served as the CTO for the Satellite 
Communications Group ($1B sales and 3,500 peop le in 1998).  He is one of the three 
engineers who created the Iridium System, the first realization of global, wireless, personal 
communications. The Iridium System integrates a packet-switched architecture within its globally deployed constellation of satellites togeth er with the circuit-switched architecture of 
the public-switched telephone network.  (Tod ay, Iridium Satellite LLC, Loudin County, 
Virginia, operates the Iridium System.)  He is known throughout the world for having 
presented keynote addresses and technical papers in many international forums, and for 
engaging in telecom regulatory activities. He has served for five years on both the Motorola 
Science Advisory Board and the Motorola Technical Action Council. 
 
Dr. Leopold joined Motorola in 1987 after having spent a career in the U.S. Air Force where 
he held a variety of technical and techni cal management positions.  He directed the 
development of communications systems at the Electronics Systems Division in Massachusetts.  He served two tours in the Pent agon, one in the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense and one on the Air Staff.  He taught for over five years at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, and worked in research and development for four years at the Air 
Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque.  He was also an Adjunct Professor of Electrical 
Engineering at George Washington University, a nd he is currently a Senior Lecturer at MIT 
and chairs their Industry Advisory Board for the Aero/Astro Department.  He has also 
lectured at Stanford University. 
 
He earned three degrees in electrical engineering, a bachelors degree from the United States 
Air Force Academy in 1967, a masters degr ee from North Carolina State University in 
1968, and a Ph.D. from the University of New Mexico in 1973.  He was also honored with a 
Doctor of Telecommunications Management Degree from South Dakota of Mines and Technology in 1997.  He has completed Executive Education courses at the Harvard 
Business School, MIT (Sloan), The University of California (Berkeley), The Center for 
Creative Leadership, and The Defense Systems Management College.   
 
Ray is an Aviation Week and Space Technology  Laureate for Space (1996) and an inductee 
in their Hall of Fame at the National Air and Space Museum.  He is a recipient of the IEEE 
Third Millennium Medal, and a recipient of the American Institute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics (AIAA) Biennial Communications  Award for 1998.  He has been named a 
Fellow  of The Institute of Electrical and Electr onics Engineers (IEEE), and has served on 
their Committee on Engineering Accreditation Activities.  He was named a Motorola 
Distinguished Innovator in 1993.  Motorola also conferred their highest technical honor, the Title of Dan Noble Fellow, upon him in 199 5.  He was named a Master Innovator by 
Motorola in 2001.  He was named a Distingui shed Alumnus of the University of New 
Mexico School of Engineering in 2003.  He al so served as a member of the Engineering</text>

          <text>Bracketing
Better that using a high hurdle rate 
Gives indication of variability in financial performance
Highly unlikely that all the factors or issues will be all 
good or all bad at the same time

          <text>Net present value (NPV)
Measure of present value of various cash flows in 
different periods in the future
Cash flow in any given period discounted by the 
value of a dollar today at that point in the future
Time is money
A dollar tomorrow is worth less today since if properly 
invested, a dollar today would be worth more tomorrow
Rate at which future cash flows are discounted is 
determined by the discount rate or hurdle rate
Discount rate is equal to the am ount of interest the investor 
could earn in a  single time per iod (usually a year) if he/she 
were to invest in a safer investment</text>

          <text>Average return on book value
Investment decision based on book rate of return of 
project relative to book rate of return of entire firm (or 
some external yardstick)
Book rate of return given by dividing the average 
forecasted profits (after depreciation &amp; taxes) by the 
average book value of the investment
Average return on book value depends on accounting 
income (different from cash flow)
Decision of yardstick is arbitrary</text>
