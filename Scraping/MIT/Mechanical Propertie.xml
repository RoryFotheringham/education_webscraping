Higher normal loading: 
Relatively independent of surface roughness 
Moisture and Pore pressure: 
Somewhat inconclusive:  dry surf aces have larger mu than wet. 
Surfactants larger mu than pure 
Temperature and Sliding Rate 
Dry conditions:  
In silicates with non interlayer wate r: no marked temperature or rate 
dependence. However, small variations in ra te dependence of the order of 
10% occur, and do seem to be important for stability.  
In minerals with interlayer water present, temperature may increase mu

Rough surfaces retard it at  normal loads &lt;100 MPa 
But, stick slip when &gt; 100 MPa 
 
Gouge often inhibits stick slip, although the type of gouge may be 
important,And slip distance may also be important 
Increase in temperature promotes stable sliding 
Increase in pressure promotes stick slip. 
For a summary see Paterson and Wong, 2005.

Stress to cause sliding: 
Amontons Law (Amonton, da Vinci) 
Force required to start sliding depends on the area of the surfaces being 
pressed together, the normal load, the material, and, in some cases, the surface roughness.  
sliding FW=  
In general, the force is linearly pr oportion to the area, so normalizing per 
unit area:  
n=    Amontons law 
Physical Basis for Amontons Law 
Suppose surface is rough on the microscale, 
Then if a small fraction of the area supports the whole load, material may yield on the asperities.  
contact WY A=  where W is the normal load, Y is the yield stress, A contact  is 
the actual contact area of all the asperities. 
 
Then if the contacts are welded the frictional stress becomes,

Coefficient of friction seems quite similar, regardless of surface 
preparation and rock type.

Conclusions: Two forces arise: 
 First, capillarity forces that  are tangent to the surface at 
each point and are proportional to the magnitude of the 
surface tension. 
Second, torque forces that are perpendicular to the surface 
and tend to rotate the surface normal into a new direction. 
These forces may be thought of as causing faceting. In the 
case of fracture surfaces, the torque terms would arise 
whenever the material had a good cleavage. 3</text>

Notice that  i.) the near crack stress is multiplied by the flaw by an amount 
proportional to the square r oot of the half-length. 
ii.)  the stress is unbounded when r=0. The energy density within the near-crack region depends on the applied stress and the geometry. 
iii.) the K factors depend only on the external loading conditions and the geometry. iv.) the open crack will have a parabolic cross-section, with the maximum 
opening being proportional to  the applied stress:  
uX 1/ 2 ()=K /E (8X /) where X is the distance back from the 
crack tip. 
Critical stress intensity factor: 
It is unreasonable to suppose th at stresses can indeed become unbounded 
in the material near the crack tip. At some point the material no longer 
behaves as an elastic material and the near tip stresses are relaxed. It 
seems reasonable to assume that if  some critical energy density is 
exceeded, the crack will extend. Griff ith considered the thermodynamics 
of extending cracks and reasoned that the mechanical energy associated 
with the work being done by displacements at the far field surfaces must 
be balanced by the energy associated  with the surfaces being formed and 
the energy stored in the elastic fiel d around the crack. If the crack extends 
irreversibly, there will also be ener gy dissipated as heat or in other 
irreversible processes.  The critical  strain energy release rate is G c, i.e. 
twice the energy released per unit area fracture surface being formed. The critical energy release rate must be achieved to extend the crack; it can be 
shown that there must be a critical stress intensity factor achieved. This 
KiC, critical stress intensity factor or fracture toughness, is a material 
parameter only. When plane strain conditions and mode I loading are 
imposed: 
2 2G =2Q =KI c (1)/Ec f 
Note:Imagine that the local stress is proportional to K iC, and that the local 
strain is proportional to K iC/E. The product is proportional to the elastic 
energy stored. The critical stress intensity  is a material parameter. 
A crack will extend when the applied st ress causes the stress intensity to 
exceed the critical stress intensity:F or example for a 2d crack in an 
infinite medium KIc =applied a</text>

Conclusions: 
1. A minimum in free energy occurs because the entropy 
term has a minimum.  
2. For very small defect concen trations the driving force to 
insert a new defect is VERY LARGE. 
3. The graph above assumes t hat the formation energies 
dont depend on temperature. 
4. An Arrhenius plot can be used to visualize the vacancy 
concentration.  
5. Crystal structure is importan t in determining formation 
energies. For example, close packed lattices dont easily 
accommodate interstitials. 
6. For crystals with the same structure, may scale the 
concentration with the melting temperature, by assuming 
that is proportional to the melting temperature

The total Gibbs free energy for the formation of n vacancies is  
 v fv fv total GnH T S=     
where  Hfv  is the enthalpy of formation for a single defect and S fv total is the 
total configurational entropy of the n vacancies-(all of them).  
From statistical mechanics, the total configurational entropy is  
 ln SkW=   
where W is proportional to the number of ways that a given thermodynamic state 
can be realized. This description of conf igurational entropy is largely a statement 
of probability. For a combination wh ere the items are indistinguishable,

Point Defects in Minerals: 
Vacancies, intersititials, impurities.  Charge balance not an issue. 
 
 
Intrinsic Point Defects:  
Local elastic distortions within the latti ce occur and relax the energy associated 
with the defect. Vacancies and interstitials may also occur as paired defects, 
especially if elastic interactions or electr ostatic charge interact ions occur.  When 
the distortions occur over a substantial num ber of sites interstitials and vacancies 
are called crowdions or relaxions, respectively. 
 
Such defects are called intrinsic point de fects, because they do not require the 
introduction of impurities or aliovalent i ons and are intrinsically related to the 
structure of the compound. A certain small number of these intrinsic point defects 
are always present at any temper ature above absolute zero.   
Number of Intrinisic Point Defects  
The number of point defects at thermal e quilibrium represents  a balance between 
the cost of enthalpy to produ ce the defect and the gain in entropy from mixing the 
defect into the crystal and disordering it. 
Consider the formation of a vacancy in a monatomic crystal. Suppose there are N 
sites from which to pluck an atom:</text>

Intro: Deformation Mechanism Maps 
As depth increases, pressure and temperature increase as well. Rate-dependent 
(creep, crytal-plastic, viscous) processe s favored. Pressure dependent (brittle, 
frictional, dilatant) processes de-emphasized.  
 
 
The lower four mechanisms involve th e production, motion, and consumption of 
crystal defects. One important aspect of  rock mechanics/mineral physics is to 
develop quantitative descrip tions of the mechanical behavior of rocks under the 
appropriate natural conditions.

Point Defects in Polyatomic Solids 
In crystals containing more than one i on, vacancies and interstitials might occur 
on either anion or cation sites. In addi tion to elastic coupling, there will be 
electrostatic interactions between the defects on the cat ion and anion sub lattices. 
For example, for a simple halide compound where only vacancies are formed, the 
number of cation vacancies must equal the number of anion vacancies. 
Alternately, if only cation de fects tend to be formed, then the number of cation 
vacancies must equal the number of cation interstitials.There ar e four possibilities 
for the paired defects: 
Frenkel Positive interstitials=positive 
vacancies Small cations in large anion 
framework 
Antifrenkel  Negative 
interstitials=Negative 
vacancies Anion Interstitials unlikely in 
Minerals 
Schottky Negative vacancies = Positive 
Vacanices Relaxions 
Antischottky  Negative interstitials=Positive 
interstitials Anion Interstitials Unlikely 
 
Schottky defects are "different ions on Same sites". Frenkel defects are "same 
ions on diFFerent sites". 
The defect concentrations are constrained to obey charge neutrality, that is, the 
sum of the effective charges of all the defects must sum to 0, and the number of 
sites in the crystal must remain constant. 
The energy of formation and hence, the concentration of defects on each sub lattice depends on the details of the crys tallography. For example: Close-packed 
sub-lattices do not accommodate interstitials.  In general, the an ions are quite large 
and thus one could expect anion interstit ials to have a much  higher energy of 
formation than anion vacancies, catio n vacancies, or cation interstitials. 
A particular example of this limitation might be the oxygen sublattice in minerals. 
Interstitials might be more likely for very  loosely packed structures like quartz (?)</text>

Theory: 
At least two separate aspects of the failure curves need to be explained. 
The yield point 
The failure stress 
Yield point: 
Most silicates at low te mperatures, laboratory load ing rates, and confining 
pressures less than 500 MPa, fail by do minantly cataclastic  processes, i.e., 
cracks form at local sites where stress heterogeities or strain 
discontinuities are expected to develop. 
(see Tapponier and Brace, 1976 and Wong, 1982). 
 
Such points of nucleation are often co rrelated with inclined flaws that 
might be expected to slip under shear loading. 
 
After the yield point, dilatant crackin g occurs, usually in an orientation 
such that cracks grow in length, mo re or less paralle to the greatest 
compressive stress (or in other words,  with the normal to the crack plane 
parallel to the least compressive stress .) This orientation provides the least 
resistance to opening.</text>

Conclusions: 
1. Qualitative explanation of dilatancy and failure. 
2. Rational explanation of local stress state during 
dilantancy and failure.  
3. Damage parameters explicitely identified. 
4. Both c and f are related to fracture mechanics 
parameters including coeff.  are related to fracture 
mechanics parameters including coeff of friction,  
K1c, crack half length and so on. 
Shortcomings: 
1. Doesnt predict Mohr-Coulomb curvature. 
2. Not tremendously sensitive to value of K 1c 
3. Values of c interpreted from theory dont closely 
match the observed (inferred) values. 
4. Dilatancy models that do not consider interaction 
require unusually low values of fricton. 
5. Doesnt include stoc hastic nature of actual 
damage (variations in length, random distributions, etc.).
