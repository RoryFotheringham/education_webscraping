          <text>Non-scientific abstract
The genetic information of a cell is stored in DNA, but much of the information 
processing of a cell is carried out by DNAs chemical cousin, RNA. Like a tape, RNA 
copies the information in DNA and uses it to direct the synthesis of proteins. The 
process of converting the information of RNA to a protein is called translation, and is 
performed by a molecule called a ribosome. Translation can slow down when RNA 
sticks to itself like a zipper. In this study, scientists find that the ribosome itself unzips 
the RNA as it translates the RNA.</text>

          <text>5-sentence scientific abstract
Amyloid protein (A P) is the major constituent of senile plaques associated with 
Alzheimers disease (AD), but its mechanistic role in AD pathogenesis is poorly 
understood. Using atomic force microscopy and electrical recording, we show that 
monomeric AP1-42forms multimeric channel-like structures after incorporation into a 
planar lipid bilayer. At the cellular level, A P1-42allows calcium uptake and induces 
neuronal degeneration and death in a dose-a nd time-dependent fashion. These effects 
are prevented by zinc (an A Pchannel blocker) and by the removal of extracellular
calcium, but are not prevented by antagonists of putative A Pcell surface receptors. 
Thus, APchannels may provide a direct pathway for calcium-dependent A Ptoxicity 
in AD.</text>

          <text>An example
The bacteriophage Muis unique among transposons
because it performs not one but two types of transposition 
reactions during its life cycle. Nonreplicative transposition 
allows the initial insertion of the m ugenome into the host 
chrom osome; replicative transposition enables Mu to make 
many copies of itself during lytic growth. While the 
mechanism  of replicative transposition has been well 
characterized for phage Mu, comparatively little is known 
about the m olecular events of nonreplicative transposition. 
The following approaches will be used to understand how Mu
transposes nonreplicatively at the tim e of infection:
A.Isolation and characterization of the DNA 
interm ediates during infection.
B.Establishment of an in vitro assay for nonreplicative
transposition.
C.Determination of the role of MuN in transposition</text>

          <text>Case Study: Collaborative research and authorship 
Bill Williams has constructed a plasmi d that allows carefully regulated 
expression of genes inserted into it. He has not found the plasmid useful in 
his own work but has discussed it w ith his colleague Harry Douglas at a 
meeting. Harry thinks he can put the plasmid to good use and asks Bill if 
he can try it. Bill is receptive to this  and sends the plasmid to Harry. Harry 
and his coworkers proceed to use th e plasmid to create several novel 
constructs that provide considerable insight into the function of two 
previously ill-studied genes. The impa ct of these studies is great, and 
Harry and his coworkers write a manuscript for submission to a 
prestigious journal. In the final st ages of writing, Harry calls his group 
together and asks how they feel about including Bill Williams on the 
author byline. What would you say?</text>

          <text>An example of Background &amp; Significance
Our primary goal is to understand how the cell stores and uses en ergy by twisting and untwisting an actin filament. Using a comb ination of 
structural, biochemical, biophysical, and molecular biology approaches, we will continue our structural and biochemical studies  on the 
acrosomal process of Limulus sperm and the energetics of the reaction. As background, this section will describe a poorly understood class 
of cellular engines, molecular springs, and then di scuss how actin filaments power the extension of the Limulus sperm acrosome using a 
spring-type of mechanism. 
Molecular Springs Among the types of cellular engines, molecular motors and ratchets are the best understood (17). Molecular motors 
include the cytoskeletal proteins: myosin, kinesin, and dynein and th e membrane rotary motors such as the bacterial flagella roto r  (4,39). 
Linear and rotary motors convert the energy derive d from ATP or a membrane potential into movement either a stepping along a filament 
or ATPase subunits. In the absence of an ex ternal energy source, there is no motion. Polymerization also performs work by pushing  a 
membrane forward. According to the Brownian ratchet model, ther mal energy causes a filament to fluctuate, permitting addition ofa 
subunit to the end  (35). The mass of unpolymerized subunits drives  the reaction like the imbalance of ions forms a membrane pot ential 
(13).
Spring-like properties of individual proteins play widely divers e roles in proteins. A spring-loaded mechanism involving the formation 
of a coiled-coil segment may be responsible for positioning fusion peptides at the membrane (6). A major contribution to the el astic force in 
muscle is thought to be due to the spring-like titin molecule. Optical tweezer and AFM measurements show that titin extensibility arises 
from modular domains which unfold at moderate to high (20-300 pN) forces  (21,38). In this cas e, the resting sarcomere length i s restored 
by titin after contraction. 
While individual proteins maybe elastic, they do not generate large movements li ke a crawling cell. However, the fastest and most 
powerful movements are caused by supramolecular springs made of bundles of a protein polymer. For example, the contractile stalk  of 
Vorticella contracts several mm in several msec when the cell body is agitated  (19). On a power-to-weight basis, the contracti le stalk is 
ten-fold more efficient an engine than a gas-powered automobile engine and an ATP-fueled muscle and two orders-of-magnitude mor e 
efficient than the polymerization-drive Thyone acrosome reaction (17).  In contrast to other types of molecular motors, contraction occur in 
the absence of nucleotide hydrolysis becaus e glycerinated cells contract when exogenou s calcium is added. Calcium binds a calmo dulin-like 
centrin-homolog, spasmin, and th e expanded lattice of filaments contract. Althoug h the major protein in the stalk, spasmin does not form 
filaments and the identity of the filament protein is undetermined (20). Although a component of contractile fibers associated with the oral 
apparatus of protozoa and positioning the nucleus (40), centrin , like spasmin, has not been s hown to polymerize. However, cen trin is 
implicated in centriole reproduction (23).

 Introduces the concept that elastic  energy is  used to cause motion.
 The three sections discuss the acro some reaction which is the cellular event that we study, the structure of 
the actin bundle, and the struct ure of the scruin protein.
 The significance is that the proj ect seeks to answer unsolved mechan isms of motility, describes a novel 
class of cellular engines,  and generalizes the study to biological springs.</text>

Text of example introduction removed. Please see the Introduction 
for the following paper:

D. L. Minor, Jr. The pore helix dipole has a minor role in inward 
rectifier channel function. Neuron 47, no. 6 (Sep 15, 2005): 833-43. 
 This introduction provides background information about the state of knowledge about 
potassium channels, ion selectivity, role of pore helix in ion selectivity. 
 Introduction does a nice job of going from the ge neral to the specific, in about 2 double-spaced 
pages: 
First paragraph: ion channels, role in electrical signaling 
Second paragraph: potassium channels, ion selectivity 
Third paragraph: pore helix 
 The introduction also shows how references pr ovide an intellectual foundation for their 
experiments.</text>
