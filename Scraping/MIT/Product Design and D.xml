          <text>Matt Ks Profile
	Matt is an outdo or enthusiasts, who frequently hikes and cycles, both alone or with 
his family of four. Being ranked among the top 10 cyclists in the United States, he 
puts great emphasis on staying healthy and having the right gear. Especially during 
racing season, he cannot afford the hassles of contaminated water and therefore 
always carries his water filter with him. However, since his hikes are mainly day 
hikes, overall usage of the water filter is limited. 
	As a successful desi gner of new products, who runs his own company and who 
teaches at two of the most prestigious institutions in the country, he is very 
demanding on the products he purchases and is often an opinion leader heard on the 
internet and among his friends, acquaintances and business contacts. 
	Enjoying a great  deal of financial freedom, he only purchases products that truly 
impress himand whose functionality is at their core. He favors air cooled Porsches 
and original Land Rovers over designs fromVersace or Graves. 
	In summary, Matt K.  can be considered a typical high end customer for water filters 
with great influence among his peers. 
	So what is goin g on in his brain?

          <text>Proposal Guidelines 
(General Information) 
	Most successful projects tend to have at least one team member with strong 
personal interest in the target market. 
	It is really nice to have a connection to a commercial venture that may be interested in the product. 
	Most products are really not very well designed. 
	The experience in this class is that if you pick almost any product satisfying the above project guidelines, you will be able to develop a product that is 
superior to everything currently on the market. 
	Just because you have used a lousy product doesn't mean that a better one 
doesn't exist. Do some thorough research  to identify competitive products 
and solutions.

(General Information) 
z	There should be a demonstrable market for the product. 
	Identify existing products that  attempt to meet the need. 
	Should at least be an attractive  opportunity for an established firm. 
	High likelihood of containing fewer than 10 parts. 
	High confidence in prototype costs being less than $1000. 
	The product should require no basic technological breakthroughs. 
	You should have access to more than five potential users of the product 
(more than 20 would be nice) 
	Save any highly proprietary ideas for another context

zSuggestion: Assign a manager for each assignment.
zBe inclusive of all team members.
zTry to meet once or twice a week.
zTeam meetings are for sharing results, reaching 
consensus, making decisions, and assigning the 
work.
zThe real work gets done outside of the meetings.
zMany teams are meeting at noon before class Tuesdays and Thursdays.

I often times drop the 
water filter on rocks. 
the WF is difficult to 
hold.
I need to at tach a virus 
filter to the WF.
The water should taste 
good.The outlet hose has a hook to con nect to water 
containers.The WF easily transfers water into  a variety of different containers
The WF is rugged.The WF operates normally after repeated dropping.
The WF is not difficult to hold.The WF is easy to  hold 
A virus filter can be attached to the WFWF accommodates a virus filter
The WF should deliver good tasting waterThe WF delivers good tasting water.WRONG RIGHT

          <text>Caveats
 Beware of the best "average" product.
 Perform concept selection for each different 
customer group and compare results. 
 Check sensitivity of selection to the importance 
weightings and ratings. 
 May want to use all of detailed requirements in 
final stages of selection. 
 Note features which can be applied to other 
concepts.

Second Order rework is the rework associated with forward 
information flows that is triggered by feedback marks.
First order rework: Output of task C causes task A to do some rework
2ndorder rework: Consequently ther e is a chance tasks depending on
A (e.g. task B) will  also be repeated.

Ris the probability that Task A will be repeated 
once task C has finished its work.
R = 0.0 : There is 0 chance that A will be 
repeated based on results of task C.
R = 1.0 :  There is 100% probability that A will 
be repeated based on results of task C.
