Migration and invasion was as sayed in 24-well cell-culture 
chambers using inserts with 8-m pore membranes as 
described.
Membranes were pre-coated with f ibronectin (2.57.5 gml-
1) for chemotaxis or Matrigel (28g per insert) and 
fibronectin for invasion studies. Breast cancer cells were 
resuspended in chemotaxis buffer (DMEM/ 0.1% BSA/ 
12mMHEPES) at 2 or 4  104cells per ml.
After incubation for 6 or 24 h for chemotaxis or 
chemoinvasion assays, respectively, cells on the lower 
surface of the m embrane were  stained and counted under a 
light microscope in at least fi ve different fields (original 
magnification, 200).
Assays were performed in tr iplicates. Chemokinesis was 
tested in checkerboard assays and  was uniformly negative  
for both CXCL12 and CCL21.</text>

Matrigel Matrix
BD Matrigel Matrix is a solubulize dbasement membrane 
preparation extracted from EHS mouse sarcoma, a tumor 
rich in ECM proteins.
Its major component is laminin, followed by collagen IV, 
heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and entactin.
At room temperature, BD Matrigel Matrix polymerizes to 
produce biologically active matrix material resembling the 
mammalian cellular basement me mbrane. Cells behave as they 
do in vivo when they are cultured on BD Matrigel Matrix.
It provid es a physiologically  relevant environment for 
studies of cell morphology, biochemical function, migration 
or invasion, and gene ex pression.</text>

          <text>Overall summary
	HBV and HCV are major worldwide human 
pathogens 
	Treatments for viral hepatitis are palliative and 
lifelong; no cure 
	Vaccine exists for HBV but not HCV
	Animal models helpful to investigate pathogenesis 
but all have limitations 
 Usually able to study early disease events with 
inflammation, or chronic gene expression without 
normal immune responses, but not both</text>

If PB is given to rats for 18 months, there may 
be a small increase in the number of hepatic 
tumors
If treatment is preceded by short exposure to 
genotoxic carcinogen such as DEN, administration 
of PB results in considerable tumor burden
With PB treatment, foci have up to 10-fold 
increase in mitotic activity and decreased 
apoptosis</text>

Onset of symptoms occurs around age 30
Often long periods of remission followed 
by relapses at intervals of months to years
Early symptoms are mild, frequently 
affecting vision, but gradually involve the 
limbs, speech, emotion, sensation and 
bladder control...ultimately leading to 
paralysis
Course of disease is highly variable, with 
average duration &gt; 25 years</text>

On February 28, 2005, the companies reported 
that they had suspended marketing of TYSABRI 
based on one confirmed case and one suspected 
case of progressive mult ifocal
leukoence phalopathy (PML), a rare and  freque ntly 
fatal, demyelinating disease of the central 
nervous system. The investigator has now changed 
the  status of the secon d case from suspected to 
confirmed. The companies are  continuing to 
examine these two cases.  As indicated in the 
announcement on  February 28, 2005, both 
patients received more than two years of 
TYSABRI  therapy in combination with AVONEX

The outlook for the biotech sector s uddenly became very bleak this week 
as shares of Biogen Idec tanked after the company  halted sales of its 
Tysabri multiple sclerosis drug, whic h was deemed by a bevy of Street 
pundits as a blockbuster drug.  The American Stock Exchange 
Pharmaceutical Index (DRG) logged another modest gain of 1.2% this 
week, while the Nasdaq Biotechnolo gy Index (NBI) plunged 6.2%.</text>

Growth of cancer is usually accompanied by

destruction of surrounding tissue
Next to metastasis, invasiveness is the 
most reliable feature that distinguishes 
malignant tumors from benign tumors

papillomavirus, and huma n herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)
H. pylori causes gastric cancer (2nd most 
important cause of cancer death worldwide)
Papillomavirus causes the vast majority of cervical 
cancer (2nd most important cause of cancer in 
women)
Liver cancer caused by hepatitis viruses (ranks 
6th in worldwide cancer incidence)</text>

          <text>Role of Membrane Disrupting 
Toxins
In some cases, the primary role appears to 
be killing of professional phagocytes, such 
as neutrophils and macrophages
In other cases, they are used by invasive 
bacteria to escape from a phagosome and 
enter the host cell cytoplasm</text>

          <text>More About A-B Toxins
Often the surface receptor for the B 
subunit is the carbohydrate moiety of a 
glycoconjugate
Distribution of receptor determines target 
cell specificity
In some cases, the A subunit needs to be 
enzymatically activated within the 
cytoplasm, by host cell proteins</text>

Toxins 
Although A-B toxins target many different 
cell types, many of them catalyze the same 
reaction
ADP-ribosylation , the transfer of ADP-
ribose from NAD to a target protein, 
changes the behavior of the target protein
Diphtheria toxin inactivates elongation factor-2
Cholera toxin constitutively activates a GsGTP-
binding protein that regulates adenylate cyclase</text>

Toxins
Two types of membrane-disrupting toxins
Pore-forming toxins insert holes in the 
membrane
Enzymes cleave bonds in membrane phopholipids
Erythrocytes provide a convenient method 
to assay activity, so these toxins are often 
called hemolysins</text>

          <text>Factors driving compensatory 
hyperplasia
HGF from nonparenchymal cells acts via c-Met 
expressed on hepatoctyes
TGF-alpha and EGF are also mitogenic for 
hepatocytes
IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced early in hepatic 
regeneration, and are necessary for the 
proliferative response
A priming event is necessary for hepatocytes to 
respond to these cytokin es and growth factors 
(degradation of ECM, release of norepinephrine, 
insulin, glucagon, etc.?)</text>

In normal adult liver, onl y 0.5 to 1.0% of cel ls are

After partial hepatectomy, the remaining cells 
proliferate to replace the lost tissue mass
Hepatocytes begin to divide by 12 hours, and 1 to

DNA
Once liver mass is restored, some 1 to 2 weeks
