buckling load, Pcrit,  is proportional to EI/L2
proportionality constant depends 
strongly on boundary conditions at
both ends: 
the more kinematically
restrained the ends are, the larger 
the constant and the higher the 
critical buckling load (see Lab 1 handout)
safe design of long slender columns
requires adequate margins with respect
to buckling

The defectfree methodology is usually subdivided into two subcategories. 
(a)	 Highcycle fatigue : 
Highcycle fatigue is associated with local cyclic stresses which are of su
ciently small magnitude so that they produce predominantly elastic straining,
 
and the resulting fatigue life exceeds  104 cycles.
 
Examples of components designed in consideration of highcycle fatigue in
 
clude most rotating and vibrating members. 
(b)	 Lowcycle fatigue : 
Lowcycle fatigue is associated with local cyclic stress levels which are su
ciently large so that signicant cyclic plastic straining occurs, and the resulting
 
fatigue life is less than  104 cycles.
 
Example applications that are designed in consideration of lowcycle fatigue
 
include core components of nuclear reactors and gas turbine engines, which 
in their lifetime may see a limited number of modestly large cyclic straining 
events associated with startup and shutdown cycles. Other application areas 
include design of many ground vehicle components which are occasionally 
subjected to overloads sucient to cause local yielding at notch roots, etc.

f = Sf/S (27)

This prediction is generally good, and conservative in the sense that experimentally
observed values for Kf satisfy Kt  Kf  1. The limiting value of Kf(max) = Kt is 
generally associated with: 
(a) higherstrength materials, and 
(b) larger notch root radii, . 
One notion which can help to suggest reasons why we can obtain Kf &lt; Kt is the 
stress gradient at the notch. The highest theoreticallypredicted stresses are experienced 
only by a vanishingly thin lamina of material on the surface of the notch, and material 
points in the bulk at any nite distance below the notch root experience less severe cyclic 
stressing. 
We presume that in notch fatigue, a critical value of fatigue damage must be sustained 
over material volume elements possessing some characteristic microstructural linear 
dimension,  . This assumption can provide qualitative insight as to the dependence 
of Kf on Kt, root radius, , and a material lengthscale,  . For example, higher
strength materials are often associated with renement of microstructural dimensions 
such as grain size, free length of dislocation segment between pinning points, etc. (recall 
the aphorism smaller is stronger in understanding plastic resistance of polycrystalline 
metals) Thus, we might expect higherstrength materials to have generally smaller values 
of  . On dimensional grounds, we also expect Kf to depend on Kt and on the ratio 
/. One empirical expression for Kf which was tted by Petersen to notch fatigue data

          <text>1. INTRODUCTION 
Fatigue Failure is the failure of components under the action of repeated uctu
ating stresses or strains. The word fatigue was introduced in the 1840s and 1850s 
in connection with such failures which occurred in the then rapidly developing railway 
industry. It was found that railroad axles failed regularly at shoulders, and that these 
failures appeared to be quite dierent from failures associated with monotonic testing. 
Fatigue failure may be dened as a process in which there is progressive, localized, 
permanent microstructural change occurring in a structure when it is subjected to bound
ary conditions which produce uctuating stresses and strains at some material point or 
points. These microstructural changes may culminate in the formation of cracks and 
their subsequent growth to a size which causes nal fracture after a sucient number of 
stress or strain uctuations. 
The adjective  progressive  implies that the fatigue process occurs over a period of 
time or usage. The occurrence of a fatigue failure is often very sudden, with no external 
warning; however, the mechanisms involved may have been operating since the beginning 
of the time when the component or structure was put to use. 
The adjective  localized  implies that the fatigue process operates preferentially at 
specic local areas, rather than homogeneously throughout the body. These vulnerable 
areas can have high local strains and stresses due to stress and strain concentrations 
caused abrupt changes in geometry and/or material imperfections. 
The phrase  permanent microstructural changes  emphasizes the central role of 
cyclic plastic deformations in causing irreversible changes in the substructure. Countless 
investigations have established that fatigue results from cyclic plastic deformation 
in every instance, even though the structure as a whole is practically elastic. A small 
plastic strain excursion applied only once does not cause any substantial changes in the 
substructure of materials, but multiple repetitions of very small plastic strains lead to 
cumulative damage ending in fatigue failure. We note that although fatigue is popularly 
associated with metallic materials, it can occur in all engineering materials capable of 
undergoing plastic deformation. This includes polymers, and composite materials with 
plastically deformable phases. Plastically nondeformable materials such as glasses and ceramics, in which deformations at ambient temperatures are truly elastic everywhere, 
do not fail by fatigue due to repeated stresses. However, recent data has shown that 
polycrystalline ceramics can exhibit fatigue crack growth under certain circumstances. 
Such a process is still consistent with our denition in the sense that local irreversible 
deformation at the crack tip associated with processes such as microcracking, frictional 
sliding, particle detachment and crack face wedging are involved in the fatigue process. 
Furthermore, these local mechanisms in brittle materials can give rise to macroscopic

          <text>Cyclic StressStrain Behavior 
The cyclic stressstrain response of metals is usually obtained by cycling cylindrical 
specimens between certain maximum and minimum imposed axial strain levels. The 
stressstrain response observed during cyclic straining is quite dierent from that observed 
in monotonic straining, and, depending on the initial state of the material and the testing 
conditions, a material may ( i) cyclically harden, ( ii) cyclically soften, (iii) be cyclically 
stable, or ( iv) soften or harden, depending on the strain range.

          <text>Mean Stress Eects on Fatigue 
The preceding section describ ed relations between stress, plastic strain, and total 
strain amplitudes and the corresponding fatigue life under conditions of fully reversed 
loading with zero mean stress. We take the mean stress associated with a cyclic loading 
between stress limits max and min to be m = ( max + min)/2, with cyclic amplitude 
a = (max  min)/2. Mean stress eects on fatigue life are most important at long lives, 
where cyclic plastic straining is small. At low lives, with signicant plastic straining, 
mean stresses quickly relax out under straincontrolled limits, or lead to cyclic ratcheting 
and runaway if it is attempted to enforce unequal stress limits. Although many design approaches have been proposed to account for longlife mean stress eects on fatigue, we 
will adopt the assumption that a tensile mean stress, 
m &gt; 0, will correspondingly reduce 
the eective fatigue strength coecient of eq. (15). The modied form of the Basquin 
relation then becomes 
a = 
f  m 
 (2Nf )b; (for m &gt; 0). (20) 
When this equation is inserted into eq. (18), the governing equation for the strainlife 
approach is as 
f  m a = ( )  (2Nf )b +   (2N f )c , (21)E f 
The eect of a positive mean stress on the strainlife curve is to reduce the longlife 
asymptote by m/E. If the mean stress was compressive, m &lt; 0, then the use of eq. (21) 
rather than eq. (18), would predict that the longlife fatigue behavior would considerably exceed that obtained under conditions of zero mean stress. While there are indications 
that this interpretation of the benecial eects of compressive mean stress on long
life fatigue performance has a degree of validity, a conservative approach would be to 
continue to use eq. (18) rather than eq. (21) (and eq. (15) rather than eq. (20)) in those 
cases where 
m is negative.

(extended) cyclic stressstrain curve would have the same symmetry in tension and 
compression as shown by monotonic stressstrain curves. 
The cyclic stressstrain curve of a material can be compared to its monotonic stress
strain curve in order to quantitatively assess cyclicallyinduced changes in mechanical 
behavior, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 8.

With respect to a cyclic stressstrain curve, the quantity y denes a cyclic yield 
strength (corresponding to a cyclic plastic strain amplitude of p = 0.002). And in a a 
manner analogous to that for the monotonic stressstrain curve, a constitutive connection 
between the cyclic stress amplitude, a, and the cyclic plastic strain amplitude, a, can 
be given in powerlaw form, similar to equation (4), by

In lowcycle fatigue, fatigue life is proportional to plastic strain amplitude to the

resulting predictions of lowcycle fatigue life.

          <text>eq. (25), the local stress amplitude is greater than at remote locations, it should come 
as no surprise that fatigue failure invariably starts at the stress concentration of a notch 
root. 
An operational denition of the severity of a given notch, in a given material, in 
reducing the longlife fatigue strength of the structure, Se, can be given in terms of the 
fatigue notch factor , Kf . Here Se is the fullyreversed nominal stress amplitude which 
may be applied to the notched component with a resulting fatigue life of some arbitrary, 
but specied, number of cycles. Often this long life (or nominal stress endurance 
limit) is chosen as 2 Nf = 107 reversals (or Nf = 5 106 cycles). Let Sf be dened as the 
stress amplitude resulting in the same fatigue life for the material, but in a uniaxially
loaded specimen. From eq. (15a), 
Sf = f  (107)b 
or 
f )1/b107 = (S f / 
The notch fatigue factor , Kf , is dened as the ratio of long life uniaxial stress 
amplitude for longlife notched stress amplitude: 
SfKf . (26)  Se 
We expect that the notched fatigue strength, phrased in terms of the nominal stress 
amplitude, will not exceed the unnotched fatigue strength, and so we expect Kf  1. A 
theoretical value for Kf can be obtained by hypothesizing that: 
(a)	 in order to obtain a notch fatigue life of 2 Nf = 107, the local stress amplitude at the 
notch root will be a = Sf . 
(b) the elastic stress concentration factor Kt relates nominal stress Sa = S to the local 
stress	 a = Sf by
 
Sf = Se
 Kt  
or 
Se = Sf /Kt.

          <text>or, in view of eq. (31) and eq. (32), 
(Kf )2(a/Sa) (a/ea) = (35) 
or, on further arrangement, 
ea  (Kf )2a = (36) a  Sa  
When the nominal stress amplitude is within the cyclic elastic limit, Sa &lt; y , then 
ea = Sa/E and 
Kf )2(Sa a = . (37) a  E 
We can insert the equation for the cyclic stress/strain curve, 
aa = + ( a )1/n , (12)E K 
into eq. (37) to obtain 
Kf )22 + Ea  ( a )1/n = (S a  . (38)a K 
For prescribed geometry, material, and loading, both Kf and Sa can be determined. 
Eq. (38) can then be solved iteratively for the resulting notch root stress amplitude, a. 
With a known, the notch root strain amplitude, a, can be determined by substituting 
the value of a into eq. (12). Finally, with the known local strain amplitude, a, the 
notch fatigue life 2 Nf is obtained from the strain life curve as 
f 
a =   (2N f )c + ( )  (2N f )b .f E 
It is important to note that a critical step in the overall methodology was the use 
of Neubers rule in the form of eqs. (36) and (37) to obtain relations between local 
and nominal cyclic loadings. Generally, Neubers rule is most appropriate for planar 
geometries in generalized plane stress with root radius  of comparable size with sheet 
thickness t:   t. The use of Neubers rule for notch roots in more triaxial states 
of stress, (e.g., in planar geometries with  &lt; t) is generally conservative in that the

Reversal To Failure,f2N' predictions of any nite highcycle fatigue life. Instead, typical practice is to use 
the SN curve, along with a desired highcycle fatigue life, to identify an associated 
ideal value of stress amplitude. Then, the design value of the cyclic stress am
plitude in the structure is reduced from this ideal value by a safety factor, often 
in the range of a factor of 2. 
Figure 13: Schematic plot of stress amplitude a versus reversals to failure (2 Nf ) for the 
highcycle fatigue regime; loglog axes. 
As mentioned previously, in the highcycle fatigue regime, the stress amplitude a 
is typically below the cyclic yield strength, y , of the material, and this produces 
small stabilized hysteresis loops, Figure 14. The area within the loop is the energy per unit volume dissipated as plastic work during a cycle. In the highcycle regime, 
this energy dissipation (loss) is small, and it decreases rapidly as the stress am
plitude decreases. However, if the imposed stress amplitude increases beyond the

the stabilized hysteresis loops rapidly become large, and the resulting fatigue life 
typically decreases to below  104 cycles. We discuss the case of lowcycle fatigue

One important limitation of the cumulative damage rule as presented here is that 
there is no explicit accounting for sequence eects on fatigue. That is, n2 cycles of 
strain amplitude a(2), followed by n1 cycles of strain amplitude a(1), would also satisfy 
eq. (24), but due to various features of the cyclic stressstrain curve, the gradual change 
(via cyclic hardening or softening) from the monotonic to the cyclic stressstrain curve, 
and other factors, there can be a block sequence eect on fatigue life. These eects can be 
accounted for to some degree in sophisticated computerbased applications of cumulative 
damage which break arbitrary loading histories into single, sequential reversals, and which 
simultaneously follow the cyclic stressstrain curve along each segment of the loading 
history. These developments are beyond the scope of this course.

highcycle fatigue performance have involved material compositions and processing 
means to increase strength, including use of alloying elements, heattreating, and 
special surfacehardening treatments (e.g., carburizing, nitriding, etc.). However,

Monotonic and Cyclic StressStrain Response : 
We have already covered many aspects of the elasticplastic behavior of polycrystalline 
metals subjected to monotonic uniaxial tensile loading and monotonic loading followed 
by elastic unloading. Under cyclic loading conditions the stressstrain response can dier 
from the monotonic response. In this subsection we will develop cyclic stressstrain 
relations to describ e this response. We shall see that the equations which describ e 
cyclic response bear a strong similarity to those describing monotonic response, but 
with dierent independent and dependent variables and dierent values for the material 
parameters. 
Monotonic StressStrain Behavior 
A stressstrain curve for monotonic uniaxial tensile loading followed by an elastic 
unloading is shown schematically in Fig. 3. The total strain  is the sum of the elastic 
strain, e, plus plastic strain, p: 
 = e + p. (2)

          <text>Fatigue Stress and Strain Concentration Factors 
The previous discussion of notches in fatigue assumed that cyclic elastic behavior 
occurs not only remotely, in response to the nominal stress amplitude, Sa, but also 
locally (at the notch root), in response to the local cyclic stress amplitude, a. While 
this will be true for suciently small amplitudes of cyclic loading, it is also possible 
for cyclic plasticity to occur. With this in mind, we introduce the (notch root) strain 
amplitude, a, (corresponding to a on the cyclic stressstrain curve) and the nominal 
strain amplitude, ea, analogously corresponding to Sa. We dene the cyclic stress 
concentration factor , K , as: aK  (31)Sa 
and the cyclic strain concentration factor , K, as 
aK . (32)   ea 
In the case of cyclic elastic deformation, both at the notch root in response to a, 
and in the nominal stress/strain relation, 
Sa = E ea; a = E a, 
so that K = K = Kt. 
When the local notch elds exhibit cyclic plastic behavior, we generally nd that 
K &lt; K t; 
K  Kt. 
One means for accounting for eects of notch root plasticity is the use of Neubers 
rule: 
t)2K  K = (K (33) 
Eq. (33) can be shown to be rigorously correct for certain cases of notch root elastic
plastic behavior, as initially shown in solutions due to H. Neuber. In applications of 
this result to notch fatigue problems (anticipating notch fatigue life correlations) it is 
common to replace  Kt  with the fatigue notch factor, Kf , giving 
f )2K  K = (K (34)

          <text>Typical values of the cyclic properties 
 , K, n 
for some metallic materials are listedy 
in Table 1. The value of n varies between 0.1 and 0.2, with an average value very close to 
0.15 = n. In general, metals with high monotonic strain hardening exponents ( n &gt;.15) 
will cyclically harden, while those with low monotonic exponents ( n &lt;.15) will cyclically 
soften. With regard to these last observations, it is perhaps appropriate to note also that 
initially soft materials often have high monotonic strain hardening exponents ( n &gt; .15), 
while initially hardened materials are often unable to display much additional hardening 
under monotonic deformation, and thus have low monotonic strain hardening exponents 
(n &lt; .15). 
As is clear from Fig. 8, it is important to note that a material which cyclically softens 
will have a cyclic yield strength lower than the monotonic yield strength. This points to 
a potential danger of using monotonic properties to predict cyclic strain amplitudes. For 
example, monotonic properties may predict that the strain amplitudes are fully elastic, 
when in fact the material may experience strain amplitudes with a substantial plastic 
component. As we shall see shortly, this can lead to severe consequences in terms of life 
predictions in fatigue.

for stresses less than a certain value, y , termed the initial yield strength . For higher 
values of , it is often found that a power law relation of the form 
1/n 
p =   or  = K (p)n , (4)K 
connects p and  very well for p  .002 or so. The dimensionless material parameter 
n is called the strain hardening exponent, with typical values .01 &lt; n .4, and 
the stressdimensioned material parameter K is called the strength coecient. Upon 
inserting equations (3, 4) into equation (2), we obtain 
1/n    (5)E K 
This equation is often referred to as a RambergOsgood stressstrain relation , in 
recognition of the early proponents of this phenomenological stressstrain relation. 
It can be seen from equation (4) that the parameter ( /K) is raised to a large power, 
1/n, and hence for (/K )  1, the plastic strain is exceedingly small. Thus, there is 
often little error associated with the use of equation (5) even for stresses  which are less 
than the initial yield strength, y . 
At the point of fracture in a tension test, the true stress at fracture , f , is dened 
by 
Pff = , (6)Af 
where Pf is the fracture load and Af is the fracture surface area. The true strain at 
fracture , f , (using the assumption of incompressibility) can be expressed as 
 A0 
f = ln , (7)Af 
where A0 is the initial crosssectional area. 
Since in ductile materials the plastic strain at fracture greatly exceeds the elastic 
strain, we may say that f is essentially equal to the plastic strain at fracture. We can 
then substitute f and f into equation (4) to solve for K as 
fK = . (8)(f )n

          <text>The pairwise connections between cyclic stresses and cyclic strains are summarized 
by a socalled cyclic stressstrain relation ; functional forms for these connections will 
be similar to those connecting stress to elastic and plastic strain in monotonic tension, 
but material parameters entering the respective cyclic and monotonic expressions 
will dier. In traditional highcycle fatigue, experimental connections are made between 
the fatigue life and the cyclic stressing, including a stationary mean stress. Alternatively, 
an equivalent correlation for highcycle fatigue could be made between fatigue life and 
the cyclic elastic strain. In low cycle fatigue, the fatigue life is robustly correlated with 
the cyclic plastic strain. Finally, using the cyclic stress/strain relations, we can combine 
highcycle and lowcycle fatigue into a single, unifying correlation of fatigue life with [total] cyclic strain. 
However, rst we examine the similarities and dierences between the monotonic and 
cyclic stressstrain response of materials.

          <text>Cumulative Fatigue Damage 
The strainlife relations developed in the preceding sections are for constant ampli
tude straining throughout the fatigue life of the member. In order to apply information 
of this type to the analysis of the fatigue behavior of structural elements which are sub
jected to other than uniform cyclic straining, it is necessary to develop a formalism for 
generalization of constant amplitude life data to variable amplitude loading. 
The earliest, and still most successful, such generalizing concept in defectfree fatigue 
analysis is that of cumulative fatigue damage , rst introduced by Palmgren and by Miner. 
In order to motivate the procedure, consider a simple twostage cyclic straining history 
consisting of n1 cycles of strain amplitude a(1), followed by application of a dierent strain 
amplitude, a(2), until failure occurs. We wish to determine the number of cycles, n2, of 
the second strain amplitude which can be applied before fatigue failure occurs. 
Let Nf1 be the number of cycles to failure for constant amplitude straining a(1). 
Obviously, in the present problem the parameter 
n1d1  (22)Nf(1) 
satises d1  1. We call d1 the damage which the material has undergone during the 
application of the rst loading block. We generalize this concept of damage and denote by 
di  the damage associated with the  ith portion of the loading history, consisting of ni 
cycles of strain range  i (strain amplitude a(i). Under constant amplitude conditions, 
this strain range would result in a fatigue life of Nf(i) cycles (or 2N f(i) reversals). The 
ith damage increment is then dened by 
ni (0  di  1). (23) di  Nf(i) 
The theory of linear cumulative fatigue damage assumes that fatigue failure occurs 
when 
ni 
di =  
= 1. (24)Nfi i i 
(Note that the application of eq. (24) to any constant amplitude history will trivially 
reproduce the baseline strainlife curve, as it should.)

          <text>behavior which is phenomenologically similar to plasticity. 
There are currently two principal methodologies for design and maintenance to resist 
fatigue failure of components, defectfree and defecttolerant . These two approaches 
are based on the how the crack size a in a component increases with the number of stress 
or strain cycles N imposed on the component. 
1. DEFECTFREE DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE APPROACH : 
The defectfree approach is mostly used to design small components which are not 
safety critical. 
In this approach, it is assumed that no cracklike defects preexist. That is, the initial crack size a is taken to be zero. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the behavior 
of crack size, a, versus the number of applied cycles of loading, N , for an initially 
uncracked component. The number of cycles to fatigue failure of the com
ponent is denoted by N
f (the subscript  f  here refers to failure) . The total 
number of loading cycles to failure may be conceptually decomposed as 
Nf = Ni + Np, (1) 
where Ni is the number of cycles required to initiate a fatigue crack , and 
Np is the number of cycles required to propagate a crack to nal fracture 
after it has initiated . Of course, the precise boundary between these two regions 
depends on the value chosen for the initiation crack size, ai. 
Although the total fatigue life, within the defectfree approach, consists of an initiation life and a propagation life, fatigue failure is often said to have occurred 
when a crack has initiated. This simplication is adopted since usually N
p  Ni; 
in such case, the propagation life, Np, can be neglected in comparison to the 
initiation life, Ni, and total fatigue life, Nf , is approximated as 
Nf  Ni. 
Further, a fatigue crack in a typical engineering component is often said to have 
initiated when it is readily visible to the naked eye, that is ai  1 mm. Of course, 
specic circumstances (e.g., small components) may require adoption of other, 
more appropriate, denitions of fatigue initiation and initiation crack size.

for wrought steels by 
 1060 = .001 in = 25 .4 m 
 = 300 ksi = 2070 MPa , 
and TS is the tensile strength for the material at hand. 
Typical values for  in steels of various conditions are: 
Material Condition Typical  
Annealed, normalized steels .01 = 0.25 mm 
Quenched and tempered steels .025 = 0.1 mm 
Highlyhardened steels .001 = 0.025 mm 
Returning to eq. (28)), we see that for /  1, Kf  Kt, while for /  1, 
Kf  1. The inection point in the curve of Kf vs. / occurs for root radii    . 
To summarize the highcycle fatigue approach to notch roots in wrought steels, we 
apply the following steps: 
Step 1 Using the materials tensile strength, TS, calculate its characteristic length 
scale, , from eq. (29). 
Step 2 Using the theoretical elastic stress concentration factor, Kt, for the notch geom
etry, calculate the notch fatigue factor, Kf, from its root radius, , and the material 
length scale , using eq. (28). 
Step 3 Calculate the nominal stress amplitude, Sa, giving highcycle fatigue failure of 
the notched component in Nf cycles (or 2N f reversals) according to 
Kf Sa = f  (2N f)b . (30)

          <text>the growth of preexisting cracks of specied initial size, ai, shape, location, and 
orientation in a structure subjected to prescribed cyclic loadings. Providing this 
goal can be achieved, then inspection and service intervals can be established such 
that cracks should be readily detectable well before they have grown to near critical 
size, ac. 
The defecttolerant approach to fatigue is typically used in the design and maintenance of large, fabricated structures such as aircraft, ships, pressure vessels, etc., 
where welds are likely sites for initial defects, and the large size of the components 
may permit substantial subcritical crack growth, so that the enlarged defect can be 
detected and repaired or replaced well before it reaches a critical dimension. Defect
tolerant strategies are also appropriate to safetycritical applications of components 
of arbitrary size. 
Within the scope of a defecttolerant approach, two subapproaches may be identi
ed. One of these is termed failsafe design . In this case, the basic concept is that 
a structure should possess a sucient redundancy of elements or components to provide assurance that, for a specied operating load, the failure or fracture of any 
single element or component will not lead to catastrophic failure of the structural 
assembly. The implementation of this approach may require a very high degree of 
conservatism in design. 
A somewhat less conservative defecttolerant approach may be termed safelife 
design and maintenance . In this approach, the basic premise is that, in a speci
ed operating interval (either total operating life, or, more commonly, an operating 
interval between scheduled shutdown, inspection, and maintenance procedures), 
no preexisting crack of specied size, location, and orientation should grow to a 
size at which a specied load would cause the element containing the crack to fail. 
In a previous handout, we have outlined major features of the defecttolerant approach 
(see also, Dowling text, Chapter 12). In the following sections we discuss the experimental foundations on which the defectfree approach to design against fatigue failure is based, 
and outline some details of how the approach is actually implemented. 
In practice, defectfree fatigue is characterized by three basic entities whose interac
tions and connections comprise the eld. These three entities are: 
1. 	the cyclic stress history at the critical location; 
2. 	the corresponding history of cyclic strain, where the cyclic strain is, in general, the 
sum of both cyclic elastic and cyclic plastic parts; and 
3. 	the number of cycles of the cyclic loading leading to the initiation of a representative 
initiation crack size, ai; within the defectfree methodology, this is equated with 
the fatigue failure life.

          <text>NOTCH EFFECTS ON FATIGUE 
We have developed certain tools for implementing a defectfree fatigue life methodol
ogy based primarily on the local strain approach to fatigue. Thus far, however, we have 
considered only small cylindrical specimens or components subjected to uniaxial cyclic 
loading. In practice, crack initiation and fatigue failure in components of more complex 
geometry are most often associated with stress concentrations arising at notches, holes, 
llets, radii, and other necessary geometrical discontinuities. 
An intuitive notion why this should be so can be gleaned from the longlife fatigue 
behavior of a notched component. If the cyclic loadings are suciently small so that 
negligible cyclic plastic strain occurs within the body, we may expect that the theory of 
elasticity can be used to calculate stress, strain and displacement. 
Consider the elliptical hole of major and minor axes (2a, 2b), respectively, located 
in a large body subject to the fareld cyclic fullyreversed nominal stress amplitude Sa, 
normal to the 2 a direction. The local stress amplitude occurring at the root of the notch, 
a a(local), can be obtained from the equations of elasticity as 
a = (1 + 2
a/) Sa Kt  Sa (25)  
Here  = b2/a is the radius of curvature at the notch root of the ellipse, and the 
dimensionless quantity Kt 1 is the stress concentration factor . A wide variety of 
elastic stress concentration factors for practical engineering geometries can be found in 
the handbook Stress Concentration Factors , by R. E. Petersen. 
For longlife fatigue of laboratorysized uniaxial [homogeneouslystressed] specimens, 
the Basquin stress/life fatigue correlation of eq. (15) gives: 
a = f (2N f )b (15a)  
or 
f )1/b2Nf = ( a/ , (15b) 
where f , the fatigue strength coecient, and b, the fatigue strength exponent, are 
material properties, and 2 Nf is the number of reversals to failure under a fullyreversed 
applied stress amplitude of magnitude a. 
Since, as noted previously, 0 &gt; b  .1, typically, we see that (long) fatigue life 
is a very sensitive function of stress amplitude  proportional roughly to the inverse 
tenth power. Thus, if we imagine a small material coupon at the notch root where, from

3. StrainLife Equation for both HighCycle and LowCycle Fatigue : 
We can now combine the equation of the cyclic strain amplitude, equation (16) 
with the fatigue life correlations for the highcycle regime, equation (15), and for 
the lowcycle regime equation (17) to obtain 

fa = (2N f )b + f (2N f )c . (18)E      
Equation (18) is the basis for the strainlife approach to design against 
fatigue failure. The strainlife equation is shown schematically in Figure 17 as 
being asymptotic to the two straight lines corresponding to equations (15) and (17) 
at long and short lives, respectively. 
Also indicated in Figure 17 is the transition fatigue life , 2N t. It is the life at 
which the cyclic elastic strain range equals the cyclic plastic strain range. Dividing 
(15) by E to obtain e and setting this equal to p

Np Nf=2.	 DEFECTTOLERANT DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE APPROACH : 
If the potential costs of a structural fatigue failure in terms of human life and dollars 
is very high, then the design of such engineering components and structures is often 
[more conservatively] based on: 
(a) The assumption that all fabricated components and structures contain a preexisting population of cracks of an initial size a
i. This initial size should be 
taken to be the larger of (i) the largest actuallydetected initial crack, and 
(ii) the detectionlimit crack size, ad, which is the largest crack size that 
can escape detection by the adopted nondestructive testing (NDT) method. 
Because it is assumed in this approach that a crack preexists, Ni = 0, and 
therefore Nf = Np. See Figure 2. 
(b) The requirement that none of the population of assumed preexisting cracks be 
permitted to grow to a critical size during the expected service life of the part 
or structure. Normally, this requires the selection of inspection intervals 
within the service life. In application of such defecttolerant strategies, it is 
also assumed that the initial location and orientation of the [typically not 
actually detected] defect is the worst possible; that is, that it occurs at the 
point of highest cyclic stress, and is oriented perpendicular to the cyclic tensile 
stress range at that location.

an initial crack size ai. The initial crack size is typically taken to be the largest crack 
size, ad, that can escape detection by NDT techniques.

Figure 4 schematically shows cyclic hardening behavior . The total strain, , is 
cycled between equal and opposite limits + (positive) and  (= +) (negative), as 
shown in Figure 4(a). The stress response to this strain cycling is shown in Figure 4(b). 
The cyclic  behavior shown in Figure 4(c) is obtained by crossplotting Figure 4(a) 
and Figure 4(b)to eliminate time. As seen in Figure 4(c), the stress required to enforce 
the strain range increases on subsequent reversals  this is called cyclic hardening 
response. 
Figure 5 shows the schematic response for a material which undergoes cyclic soft
ening. The stress required to enforce the strain excursions decreases with subsequent 
reversals. 
The underlying physical reason for materials to harden or soften during cyclic strain
ing appears to be related to the nature and stability of the dislocation substructures in 
metallic materials. Qualitatively speaking, 
1. 	For a material which is initially soft, say due to an annealing heat treatment, 
the initial dislocation density is low, and during cyclic plastic straining, it increases rapidly. This increase in dislocation density causes a cycledependent strengthening 
termed cyclic hardening . 
2. 	For a material which is initially hard , say, due to prior coldwork, the initial dislo
cation density is high, and during cyclic straining the rearrangement and annihila

and martensitic steels exhibit an endurance limit. 
The 7075T6 aluminum alloy, like most other nonferrous alloys, does not show 
a true endurance limit. However, for engineering purposes a pseudoendurance 
limit for nonferrous materials is often dened as the stress amplitude correspond
ing to a long fatigue life of 5  106 cycles. 
There is an important empirical relationship between the endurance limit, e, for 
wrought (not cast!) steels , and the ultimate tensile strength TS for the ma
terial, which is obtained lessexpensively from a monotonic tension test. As shown 
in Figure 12,

In 1910, Basquin1 observed that the a versus Nf data could be eectively lin
earized on loglog axes. A schematic plot of log a versus log(2 Nf) is shown in 
Figure 13, where 2 Nf is the number of reversals to failure . Note that there

          <text>tion of dislocation substructures causes the overall dislocation density to decrease. 
This decrease in dislocation density causes a cycledependent loss of strength termed 
cyclic softening . 
The cyclic stress amplitude for either type of material, often saturates to an es
sentially constant value after a number of strain reversals. The stable cyclic behavior 
of metals can be describ ed in terms of amplitudedependent [  stable] stressstrain hys
teresis loops, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

With respect to this gure, the quantities

denote the total strain range , the elastic strain range , and the plastic strain range , 
respectively. Referring again to 6, it is clear that the total strain range can be additively 
decomposed as the sum of the elastic and plastic strain ranges, 
 = e + p, 
and that the elastic strain range,  e, is related to the stress range,    max  min,

          <text>we recall from our previous examinations of elasticplastic materials that, in gen
eral, increases in strength are invariably accompanied by decreases in ductility, or 
monotonic true strain at fracture. And these associated reductions in the materials 
ability to undergo plastic deformation without fracture under monotonic loading 
also manifest themselves in a corresponding decrease in its fatigue ductility coe
cient, f . Reduced values of the latter material property mean that lower fatigue 
lives will result from application of any given value of plastic strain range, a. This 
trend in overall strain amplitude/fatigue life response, as a function of hardness in 
various quenched and tempered states of alloy steel 4142 are shown in the table 
below.

&gt; 1. HighCycle Fatigue, Nf  104 Cycles : 
Consider a cylindrical specimen under the action of a timevarying axial stress 
history, (t), as shown schematically in Figure 9. 
Figure 9: Fatigue testing under constant amplitude stress cycling. 
With respect to this gure, the quantities 
 =	max  min, 
 a = , and	 (13)2 
1 m = ( max + min )2 
are called the stress range , the stress amplitude , and mean stress, respectively. 
In what follows we shall rst examine the relationship between the stress amplitude 
a and the fatigue life Nf in the absence of a mean stress (i.e., when m = 0), and 
then modify the relation for situations when a nonzero mean stress is present. 
In the highcycle fatigue regime, the stress amplitude a is typically below the 
cyclic yield strength  of the material. The stress amplitude a versus fatigue life y 
Nf data obtained from conducting experiments at various values of a are often 
plotted on semilog scales, and are called SN curves (S for Stress amplitude; N 
for Number of loading cycles to failure). Figure 10 and Figure 11 show SN curves for the aluminum alloy 7075T6 and for A517 steel, respectively.

          <text>notch fatigue life tends to be underestimated. A dierent (and easier to use) connection 
between local and nominal elds which is more appropriate for small /t or for axial 
symmetry is the socalled  linear rule : 
K = Kf (39) 
resulting in a = Kf (40) ea 
or 
a = Kf ea. (41)  
For elastic response to the nominal stressing, ea = Sa/E, and the linear rule gives the 
notch strain amplitude as 
Saa = Kf (42)  E 
Notch fatigue life for this class of notches is also obtained by substituting the local 
strain a determined from eq. (42) into the strain/life correlation of eq. (18). The cyclic 
strain determined from eq. (42) will generally be smaller than that obtained from eqs. 
(20) and (19), so that somewhat dierent lives are predicted.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM IN FRACTURE 
Distributed: Wednesday, April 7, 2004 
A spherical thinwalled pressure vessel is to be fabricated from formed plates. The capacity 
of the vessel is to be 14 m3, and the uid it contains will be under a peak internal pressure of 
50 MPa . You may use the standard stress analysis of thinwalled spherical pressure vessels 
to relate stress to pressure and vessel geometry. 
Three grades of marageing steel are under consideration for constructing the vessel. The table gives the tensile yield strength ( 
y) and fracture toughness (K Ic) of each grade. Each 
of the steels has mass density  = 7.8Mg/m3 .

You are to specify the material and corresponding wall thickness so that the structure will
1. be of least weight, while 
2. retaining a factor of safety of at least 2 against both 
(a) yielding and 
(b) brittle fracture.

Now suppose that a given load jump, P(t), 
is applied to a geometrically identical linear viscoelastic body
having creep function Jc(t).
All stress components in the body are time-independent, and spatially
vary precisely as they do in an identical linear elastic body subject 
to the same load.
The loading produces time-dependent displacement vector u(x,t)
and corresponding strain components.
The magnitudes of the displacement and strain components are
proportional to both P and Jc(t).

          <text>Correspondence Principle
Suppose that a given displacement jump, (t), 
is applied to a geometrically identical linear viscoelastic body
having stress relaxation modulus Er(t).
All displacement and strain components everywhere in the body are 
time-independent, and precisely equal those in an identical 
linear elastic body subject to the same applied displacement.
These boundary conditions produce time -dependent loads, P(t), and stresses
The magnitudes of the time-dependent load and of the
stress components are proportional to both  and to Er(t).
EXAMPLE: Three-point
Mid-span bending:
For suddenly-applied displacement, 
replace E with Er(t) in an elastic 
solution.</text>

          <text>Correspondence Principle
Suppose that a given load, P, produces displacement vector u(x) 
in a linear elastic body having Youngs modulus E. 
The displacement vector depends on the position vector
x = x ex+ y ey+ z e .z
The magnitudes of the displacement and strain components are
proportional to P and inversely proportional to E.

of stress or strain uctuations. 
The word progressive implies that the fatigue process occurs over a period of time 
or usage. A fatigue failure is often very sudden with no external warning; however, the 
mechanisms involved may have been operating since the beginning of the time when the 
component or structure was put to use. 
The word localized implies that the fatigue process operates at local areas rather than 
throughout the body. These local areas can have high strains and stresses due to abrupt changes in geometry and material imperfections. 
The phrase permanent microstructural changes emphasizes the central role of cyclic 
plastic deformations in causing irreversible changes in the substructure. Countless investigations have established that fatigue results from cyclic plastic deformation in every 
instance, even though the structure as a whole is practically elastic. A small plastic strain 
excursion applied only once does not cause substantial changes in the microstructure of 
ductile materials, but multiple repetitions of very small plastic deformations leads to 
cumulative damage ending in fatigue failure. We note that although fatigue is popularly

is the more common. 
Figure 2: Crack length a versus applied cycles of loading, N 
If crack growth occurs over a large number of load cycles, N, then crack length awould 
be observed to increase with increasing N, as shown in the gure. Failure by fracture 
would occur when the crack had reached the critical crack size, ac, and the useful service 
life of the structure would be a suitable fraction of the number of cycles required to propagate the crack from size a
i to ac. The critical crack size can be determined, based 
on reaching the plane strain fracture toughness at the maximum cyclic stress:

and constant  . The structure of the dependencies of N on the system variables is aiaf 
extremely revealing. In particular, the dominant role of ai is clearly seen for m &gt; 2. Also, 
the essential futility of improving fatigue crack propagation life by increasing toughness 
is evident. For m &gt; 2, we see that the fatigue life is bounded, even if the material were to 
be made innitely tough, with critical crack size ac = a . Similarly, the weak log f  
arithmic improvement in fatigue crack propagation life with increasing ac = af for m= 2 
is likewise indicative of little benet of increased toughness on fatigue crack propagtion 
life. Finally, the nthpower dependence of growthrate on  (or on [load], in general) 
is directly reected in a corresponding inverse powerlaw dependence of fatigue crack 
propagation like on cyclic load range.

          <text>We have emphasized that most engineering materials contain small cracklike defects, 
or they can readily develop them during service. 
If a crack exists in a structure, then the stress eld in the vicinity of the crack tip is 
given by 
KIij(r, )  fij() as r 0, 
2r  
where the stress intensity factor is 
KI = Q  a , 
with  the fareld applied Mode I tensile stress, a the crack length, and Q the congu
ration correction factor. 
Under smallscale yielding, and when monotonically increasing fareld load is applied 
to the body, then a necessary condition for crack extension is 
KI = KIc, 
where KIc is a material property called the plane strain fracture toughness. 
The above criterion for fracture is deceptively simple. In practice there are problems 
associated with identifying the shape and size of a crack, with carrying out a proper 
stress analysis, and in obtaining accurate and/or valid data for KIc. Also, cracks can 
extend in a subcritical manner, which means that a component initially thought to be 
safe against fracture may become dangerous after a period of service. Subcritical crack nucleation and growth can occur under constant or uctuating loads. In the former case, 
crack extension is usually controlled by an aggressive environment which causes stress 
corrosion cracking; we shall return to a study of this phenomenon later. Subcritical crack 
nucleation and growth under uctuating loads is called fatigue. It is this phenomenon to which we now turn our attention. 
Failure occurring from repeated uctuating stresses or strains is called fatigue. The 
word fatigue was introduced in the 1840s and 1850s in connection with such failures 
which occurred in the then rapidly developing railway industry. It was found that railroad 
axles failed regularly at shoulders, and that these failures appeared to be quite dierent from failures associated with monotonic testing. Even then, elimination of sharp corners was recommended. 
The process of fatigue failure may be dened as a process in which there is progressive, 
localized, permanent microstructural change occurring in a structure when it is subjected 
to boundary conditions which produce uctuating stresses and strains at some material point or points. These microstructural changes may culminate in the formation of cracks

          <text>Also shown in the plot of avs. N are extrapolations to values of crack length a &gt; a c 
and a &lt; a i  ad. These extrapolations, of course, can be realized only by changing the 
initial and nal conditions. If either (or both) changes could be made, it is evident that 
an increase in the safe service life could be realized. How could such changes be made? 
First, the reduction of ai requires a reduction in the minimum reliablydetected crack 
size of the NDE procedure. An increase in ac could be obtained by raising KIc (for 
example, either by changing materials or by changing material processing). Although 
the latter option may at rst seem tempting, there is far greater payo  in decreasing 
the ad of the NDE technique. The reason is that the growth rate (slope of the avs. N 
curve) is much lower initially ( a  ai) than at the end. A few percent increase in ac 
buys only a small amount of extra service life, while a similar percentage decrease in ad 
provides substantially greater increases in useful service life. 
Fatigue Crack Growth 
To obtain a fatigue crack growth curve for a particular application, it is necessary to establish reliable fatigue crack growth rate data. Typically, a cracked test specimen is 
subjected to a constant amplitude load cycling stress range   
 max min and two  
curves, the crack length a versus the number of cycles, and  KI for that geometry of 
testing versus the crack length are obtained. Here  KI = Qais the range of the 
stress intensity factor over one cycle of load, while crack length is essentially constant at 
value a. Note that a considerable portion of the life of the specimen is spent at short 
crack lengths. 
The crack growth rate is denoted by

curve at crack length a. 
 crack extension  aof a crack 
of length aoccurring in one cycle. 
Thus, from experimentally determined curves of a vs. N and knowledge of applied 
daloads and geometry of the test specimen we can construct dN vs. a and  KI vs. a 
curves. On crossplotting from these curves to eliminate the variable a, we can construct 
log  da  
versus log( KI ) curves. dN

Experimentally, it has been found that for a given load ratio R  min/max = 
KImin /KImax , the plots of log  da  
versus log( KI ) obtained from various dierent specidN 
men types superpose on one another to give a single curve for a given material. The fact 
that such a curve can, to a good approximation, be considered to be a material curve, 
independent of geometrical factors, is of great practical importance: the results obtained 
from simple laboratory specimens can be directly applied to real service conditions, provided the stress intensity factor range in the latter case can be determined. 
At a xed Rratio, the fatigue crack propagation behavior of metallic materials can 
be divided into three regimes. The boundaries dividing adjacent regimes can be specied either by the magnitude of the transitional growth rate per cycle or by the magnitude of the cyclic stress intensity factor,  K
I . The former distinction provides more physical 
insight, especially when the growth rate per cycle is compared with other relevant metal

          <text>associated with metallic materials, it can occur in all engineering materials capable of 
undergoing plastic deformation. This includes polymers, and composite materials with plastically deformable phases. Plastically nondeformable materials such as glasses and ceramics, in which deformation is truly elastic everywhere, do not fail by fatigue due to 
repeated stresses. However, recent data has shown that ceramics can exhibit fatigue crack 
growth under certain circumstances. This process is still consistent with our denition in the sense that local irreversible deformation at the crack tip associated with processes such as microcracking, frictional sliding, particle detachment and crack face wedging are involved in the fatigue process. Furthermore, these local mechanisms in brittle materials can give rise to macroscopic behavior which is phenomenologically similar to plasticity. 
Cracktolerant Design and Maintenance 
Against Fatigue Failures 
If the potential cost of a structural fatigue failure in terms of human life and dollars 
is very high, then the design of such engineering components and structures should be based on: 
1. The	 assumption that all fabricated components and structures contain a pre 
existing population of cracks of a minimum size. This minimum size should be taken to be the minimum that can be reliably detected by nondestructive examina
tion (NDE) methods. 
2. The requirement that none of these presumed preexisting cracks be permitted to grow to a critical size during the expected service life of the part or structure. Normally, this requires the selection of inspection intervals within the service life. 
The major aim of defecttolerant approaches to fatigue is to predict reliably the growth 
of preexisting cracks of specied initial size ( ai), shape, location and orientation in a 
structure subjected to prescribed cyclic loadings. Providing this goal can be achieved, 
then inspection and service intervals can be established such that cracks should be readily 
detectable well before they have grown to near critical size, ac. 
The accompanying gure schematically illustrates the overall approach. A structure 
is subjected to a load P which cyclically varies between maximum and minimum values, 
Pmax and Pmin, respectively. This loading causes a similar cyclic variation in the remote 
stress level, . The structure is assumed to have a preexisting crack of initial size ai 
located at the most highly stressed location. The initial size can be either the largest 
preexisting crack detected by the NDE technique used, or (if no crack was actually 
detected) the initial crack size is assigned to be ad, where ad is the minimum crack size

That is,  KIo and  ao are the values of any point on the power law growth rate curve. 
Then the power law expression 
 da  
= A(K I)m 
dN 
may be written simply as  da   K I m 
= a o , (1)dN K Io 
where the material constants 
 da  
= a o, K Io, m dN o 
have more familiar dimensions. In applying eq. (1), it is understo od that the driving 
force for cyclic crack growth is the cyclic stress intensity factor 
 K I = Qa; Q = Q(a). 
This last expression is dimensionally misleading since Q is dimensionless, while [ a] = 
length. Rather, it is intended to remind us of the possible functional dependence of Q 
on variable crack length in a structure of xed geometry (e.g., width w). In general, 
 Q = Q(a/w ), etc. 
Integration of CrackGrowth Equation 
By rearranging (1), we have the dierential expression 
(K Io)m da dN = ,a0 (K I)m 
which can be integrated (on the left with respect to N and on the right with respect to 
a) as 
af af Nai(K Io)m  da Nai dN =  da  
ai  
af  
0 dN o Q(a)am .

          <text>In writing the integrated form, we have emphasized that Nai is the number of cy af 
cles required to grow a fatigue crack from initial value  a = ai  to nal crack length 
a = af  under the application of cyclic stress range   in a material having powerlaw 
fatigue crack growth behavior. We have accounted for the dependence of  KI on a by 
substituting the stress intensity factor calibration  KI = Qa under the integral 
sign. 
For constant  , this term can also be factored outside the integral: 
(K Io)m  af1 da = m . (2) Naiaf ao ()mai 
Q(a)a1/2
In general, Q(a) is a complex function of the crack length, and it is usually necessary 
to perform the integration numerically. However, if Q is constant, independent of a, then 
(2) reduces to 
(K Io)m  af m 1 = a 2 da. (3) Naiaf ao (Q)m ai 
Assuming ai is known, we may dene the initial range of cyclic stress intensity factor as 
K Ii  Qai. Thus, on multiplying the numerator and denominator by am/2 , we i 
obtain 
m/2 m  afai KIo 
m Naiaf = da  K Ii ai a 2 da. (3a)

&gt;Regime C: (da/dN ) 105 m/cycle 
In Regime C the crack growth rates are very high, and consequently little fatigue crack 
growth life is involved. Region C has the least importance in most fatigue situations. In this region the stress levels are high enough ( K
max approaches KIc in Regime C) so that 
crack extension due to the static modes of failure like cleavage and microvoid coalescence 
is superposed onto the mechanism of cyclic subcritical crack extension. Because the 
static fracture modes are sensitive to microstructure and stress state, the growth rates in Regime C (also known as the Static Modes Regime) are sensitive to the microstructure, 
the Rratio and specimen thickness . However, because ( da/dN ) in this regime is so high, 
it is insensitive to the environment and the frequency. 
For cracktolerant design procedures the log  da  
versus log( KI ) curve is approxidN 
mated as 
If KI &lt; K Ith then ( da/dN ) = 0 
If KI  K I th then ( da/dN ) = A(K I )m

          <text>&lt;Regime B: 108 &lt;  (da/dN )  105 m/cycle 
In this regime, for a given value of R ratio, there is an essentially linear relationship 
between log  da  
and log(K I ):dN 
 da 
log10 = log10 A + m log10(K I )dN 
= log10 A + log10 {(K I )m } 
= log10 {A(K I )m } 
or da = A(K I )m . dN 
In this equation,  A and m  are experimentally determined material constants de
dascribing the straight line portion of the dN vs.  KI curve. Over a broad spectrum of 
engineering alloys, the range of the dimensionless exponent m is  2  m  12, with 
a typical value of m  4. In Regime B (also known as the Power Law or Con
tinuum Regime) there is relatively little inuence of microstructure, Rratio, or dilute 
environment on the fatigue crack growth behavior, and hence, on the constants A and 
m. The power law form of fatigue crack growth law was rst proposed by Paris, Gomez, 
and Anderson, and is often referred to as the Paris law.

FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH EXAMPLE 
Distributed: Wednesday, April 14, 2004 
A bar of 4340 steel, of thickness t = 12 mm and width w = 60 mm, is subjected to a cyclic 
bending moment that ranges from maximum value M(max) = 4kNm to minimum value 
M(min) = 0.8 kNm . 
Figure 1: Schematic of edgecracked specimen under bending. 
The steel has Youngs modulus E = 208 GP a, Poisson ratio  = 0.3, tensile yield strength 
y = 1255 MP a, and ultimate tensile strength UT S = 1295 MP a. 
Fatigue crack propagation in the alloy is wellrepresented by a Paristype relation of the 
sort  K I mda = a 0 ,dN K I0 
where the exponent is m = 3.24, and the reference constants can be taken as a growth 
rate of da/dN = 103 mm/ cycle  a0 when the applied stress intensity range is  KI = 
100 MP am  K I 0. 
After 60 , 000 cycles of the loading describ ed, the bar fractures, with failure due to a through
thickness edge crack of [failure] length af = 14 mm, emanating from the tensile side of the 
bending stress eld.
