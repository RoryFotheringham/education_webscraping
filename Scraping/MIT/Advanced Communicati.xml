          <text>Bad versus Good Feedback
Bad Feedback

focuses on blame; 
creates defensiveness 
and confrontation
2) Problem -oriented; 
does not improve skill
3) Undermines 
confidence and self -
esteemGood Feedback
1) Encourages, focuses 
on improvements 
achieved or possible; 
creates trust and 
cooperation
2) Solution -oriented; 
improves skills
3) Increases 
confidence in ability and 
potential

Human behavior in decision making groups is 
notrandom
A team role is simply a tendency to behave, 
contribute and interrelate with others in a 
particular way.
8 distinct roles have been identified
Most people have 2 or 3 preferred roles
Most people can be flexible about the roles they 
adopt remember that context matters!

A complementary skill to advocacy that:
Seeks to discover information about why a 
particular view is held
Asks questions about underlying assumptions, 
beliefs, and reasoning
Explores:
Why do you believe this?
What logic leads to this conclusion?
What facts and data do you have?
What examples or past experience exists?

          <text>Inquiry Exercise
In groups of three, Person A (Inquirer) will ask 
Person B (Explainer) a question of interest.  
Person B responds at length -you have up to 
five minutes -and Person A humbly inquires 
about what he/she is learning.  Person C 
observes.

          <text>People have different perspectives
People in the same situation reach different conclusions.
All believe their conclusions are obvious, with no need to illustrate the 
steps.
The result: confusion, conflict and misunderstanding with all sides 
hurling conclusions at one another from the top of their ladders or 
simply withdrawing. Communication is Meaning+Relationship
And it gets us into trouble
