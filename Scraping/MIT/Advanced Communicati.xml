confidence and self -
esteem&#61550;Good Feedback

on improvements &#8211;
achieved or possible; 
creates trust and 
cooperation

          <text>Giving Negative Feedback 
Properly
&#61550;Get your emotions under control.
&#61550;Find a private setting.
&#61550;Focus on actions/behaviors; not the                   
person.
&#61550;Be specific. Be timely.  Be calm.
&#61550;Stop talking and LISTEN.
&#61550;Define positive steps.

&#61607;Feedback delivered during a 
performance review should not come
