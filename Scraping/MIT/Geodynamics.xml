          <text>Lecture 3:  Different Re presentations of Stress 
 
The stress tensor can be represented in differe nt ways to highlight pa rticular features or 
aid in solving geodynamic problems.  This lect ure explores how to represent the stress 
tensor in terms of principle stresses and isotropic and deviat oric stresses. Representing 
the stress tensor in terms of principle stresses makes visualizing the state of stress easier 
because it reduces the stress tensor to only three numbers.  It also makes some 
calculations easier.   Representing the stress te nsor in terms of isotropic and deviatoric 
stresses is helpful in determining the type of faulting produced by certain stresses. 
 
1. Principle Stresses and Principle Axes 
 
The stress tensor is a matrix that specifies  the tractions on three mutually perpendicular 
faces of an infinitesimal cube. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, these tractions are both parallel  and perpendicular to the normal vectors of 
the faces.  At a certain orienta tion of the faces, however, the tractions are only parallel to 
the normal vectors.  The directions of these normal vectors are called principle directions 
and the stresses are called principle stresses.  Calculating the prin ciple directions and 
stresses requires using eigenvalues.

          <text>2. Isotropic and Deviatoric Stress 
 
The stress tensor can be divide d into two parts:  isotropic stress and deviatoric stress.  
The isotropic stress is defined as  0
ij
 
ij kk ij31 0=  
 
It rep resents the m ean norm al stress or pr essure.  Subtracting the m ean norm al stress 
from  the stress tenso r produces the d eviato ric stress  d
ij
 
0
ij ijd
ij=  
 
The deviatoric stress represents the part of the stress that di ffers from  a hydrostatic state.</text>

Another digression:  An am azing result from  rock m echanics, "Byerlee' s law," is that f s  
is essentially independent of rock type!

plane reaches a value of f s n, the sand pile will f ail.  The com plication is that we no</text>

3)  Expensive houses were built on top of the terrace. 
4)  Lawns were watered lavishly. 
5)  Landslides started wrecking the expensive houses.

We will exam ine the "continuum  mechanics" of this situation &amp; com e up with som e 
"expert opinion" about responsibility.  W e need to do two things:  first, understand how 
sand responds to "internal forces," then understand how to describe these forces. 
 
Assertion:  Sand pile behavior, as a first approxim ation, is governed by friction .  So are 
earthquake faults.   
(reading:  T &amp; S, pp 351-353) 
 
 Consider an experim ent to m easure the fric tional behavior of sand.  One approach would 
be to place som e sand between a block &amp; a table, subjecting the block to a downward 
force F and a horizontal force V (in T&amp;S notati on).  If the block has area A, there is a 
 normal traction   n = F/A 
 and a shear traction    = V/A</text>

          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>12.520 Lecture notes #1  5 
 
Fig. 1_4  
 
 
Adm onton' s law (to sum marize a lot of experim ents) states that the shear force needed to 
cause sliding is related to the norm al force pressing the block down as  
V = f s F 
or, in term s of tractions  
 = fs n 
Digression:  One very sensitive way of  measuring f s  (developed at MIT) is to use an 
inclined plane &amp; vary the inclination angle .  Suppose this is done &amp; loading is carried 
out by varying the # of bricks squeezing the sand.  How will  depend on the # of bricks?

Logical contradiction between mathematical process of taking limits &amp; physical 
breakdown of continuum description at small scales ignored.  (Assume - fields varying slowly enough that math defined before description falls apart.) 
 
At core:  Newton's 2nd Law:         F  = m a, or F -ma = 0. 
 for this course, a = 0 =&gt; the governing equation is F = 0! 
   Applies not just to particles, entire bodies, but to regions within bodies. 
   Free-body diagram - cut open body (thought experiment), examine forces of 
interaction between surfaces. 
 
Description of forces acting in the continuum -  For taking limits, etc, forces/unit area 
make sense.  Consider tractions  T:  Force/unit area on faces (vector quantities). 
 
Units:  SI - Pascal (Pa); 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 
 cgs:  dyne/cm 2 
 "geophysics": bar ( 1 atmosphere): 1 bar = 10 6 dynes/cm 2 = 0.1 MPa 
A general description of the tractions acting on planes of arbitrary orientation requires:
   stress - forces of interaction (2nd rank tensor) 
    Newton's 2nd &gt;  ij,j + fi = 0. 
   strain &amp; rotation  - kinematics of motion &amp; deformation  (2nd rank  
   tensors) 
   rheology (constitutive law) - relationship between stress &amp; strain 
   solids - elastic, plastic, brittle 
   fluids - viscous, ideal 
   other - e.g., Silly putty, paint,  
 
We will quantify these quantities soon, but first a digression to a concrete example to 
bring things into focus.  When I moved to southern CA ~ 1980, I was impressed by press coverage of a set of law suits pending against various governments (state &amp; local).  The question to be settled was who was responsible for an expensive housing development "sliding into the ocean."  Briefly, the sequence of events was: 
1) "Nature" deposited a terrace (mainly sand) beside the ocean. 
2)  The highway department made a road cut into the base of the sea cliff to put in a 
coastal highway.</text>

Ignore fine structure.  Assum e: 
  Continuity :  com pletely fills space (no pores or voids) and has properties 
describable by continuous functions.  [Scale dependent.  E.g., sand will be treated as a 
continuum ] 
  Homogeneity  - identical properties at all points   [Scale dependent.] 
  Isotropy  - properties sam e in all directions.  [Often not true. e.g., schist] 
Behavior describable in term s of partial differential equations subject to boundary 
conditions.  All functions will be "well be haved," except at a finite # of surfaces.</text>

longer have a brick &amp; a bench to work with  what we need is a m athem atical 
description of norm al and shear tractions on arbitrary planes in a continuum .  We start 
out with a special description of the tractions on a surface oriented with the coordinate 
system , then will go on to generalize. 
 
It is useful to break tractions into their com ponent parts (norm al &amp; shear): 
Define ij as force/unit area acting on face with norm al ni in direction n j. 
Consider now a sm all parallelepiped with faces in the co-ordinate planes and dim ensions 
dx1, dx 2, and dx 3. The tractions on the three faces can be resolved into their Cartesian 
components, one norm al and two tangential to the face on which the traction acts: 
 
T(1)i=(11,12,13)
T(2)i=(21,22,23)
T(3)i=(31,32,33) 
where  T denotes the traction on the face norm al to the axis x1, and so on. The nine 
components of the tractions form  a (1)i
33 matrix 
 
ij=111213

where for each com ponent the first subscript denotes the co-ordinate axis to which the 
surface is norm al, and the second subscript denotes the direction in which the com ponent 
acts. For exam ple, 23denotes the com ponent acting on the face norm al to in the

Consequently, ij i=j can be thought of as a measure of elongation in the direction i.  It is 
equal to a change in length per unit length of a material.  Fo r example, if a metal rod of 
length l is stretched to a new length l+l, the elongation ij is equal toll.

          <text>Lecture 7 :  Strain 
 
Lectures 5 explored faults and brittle defor mation across a failure plane.  The next set of 
lectures deals with ductile deform ation:  stretching, com pressing, and twisting m aterials 
into different shapes without breaking them .  Thi s lecture and lecture 9 treat the 
mathem atical descr iption  of ductile d eformation c alled str ain.  Lecture s 11 and 12 
describe the relationship be tween strain and stress.  
 
1. Finite S train and Inf initesimal Strain  
 
Finite strain is characterized by big changes in the shape of a body.  Infinitesim al strain 
is characterized by sm aller change s.  The next couple of lectur es trea t infinites imal strain 
only becaus e the sm all changes in sh ape cause sq uared and h igher-ord er term s in the 
strain equation to be very sm all.  These term s are neglig ible and m ake the strain equation 
simpler. 
 
2. Infinitesimal Strain 
 
Definition
 
Stress is a second-order tensor that provide s a relationship between a norm al vector and 
a traction vector.  Strain is  also a second-order tensor that provides a relationship 
between two vectors:  a position vector dx i and a displacem ent vecto r dui.  Consider the 
following picture:

Interpreting the Strain Tensor
 
The strain tensor looks complicated.  What it means in terms of stre tching, twisting, and 
rotating a body is not obvious.  A few simple examples, however, help illustrate what its 
components mean in terms of different kinds of deformation. 
 
a. Translations 
 
In the case of rigid-body translations,  du equals zero.  The strain tensor has no sensitivity 
to them.   
 
b. Rotations 
 
Consider the following figure: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
    
Assuming that the deformation is continuous, du  is related to dx  by the equation:

Sources of tectonic stress are of great interest  to geodynamics, particular ly if variations in 
stress can be interpreted in terms of interesting processes. Recall, from equilibrium, 
ij , j + fi = 0 
If we can ignore body forces, then, for example, 
 xx xz= x  z

          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>This can be done by integrating the normal traction as a function of depth to determine 
the total normal force (per unit length into the picture) acting on each of the two vertical 
faces of the pill box: 
Moho 
Flength = ndyx 
surface 
The normal traction exerted by th e continent on the pill box is  everywhere greater than 
the normal traction exerted by the oceanic structure on the pill box. The total force on the 
pill box is just the area shaded with hor izontal hatchure in the figure below. 
Fig. 4_1 
4) Since our assumptions have led to an unbalanced force on the pillbox that would lead 
to an infinite acceleration as  the thickness of the pill box shrinks, something must be 
wrong with our assumption. So we need to modify our model to decrease the magnitude of the normal traction exerted by the continent, increase the normal traction exerted by 
the oceanic structure, or both. 
5a) If we "fix" our problem in the contin ent, we require a non lithostatic horizontal 
extension. 
5b) If we "fix" our problem in the oceanic region, we require a nonlithostatic horizontal 
compression. 
5c) Of course, another solution would be to have horizontal compression in the continent, with even more horizontal compression in the oceanic area. 
Note: Isostasy and lithostatic stress cannot exist simultaneously! Areas of thickened crust tend to have a state of stress that is more extensional than nearby regions of thin 
crust.</text>

Assertion: most of the stress tensor in the Earth is close to "lithostatic," 
ij~ -gd ij, 
where  is the average density of the overburden, g is gravitational acceleration, and d is 
the depth of the point  under consideration. 
Consider the following table of the lithostati c pressure at variou s points of interest: 
depth 
(km) Pa bars 
ocean ridge crest 2.5 25 MPa 250 
abyssal plain 4 40 MPa 400 
deep sea trench 12 120 MPa 1.2 kbar 
base of crust 30 1 GPa 10 kbar 
transition zone 600 20 GPa 200 kbar 
Core-mantle bndry 2900 140 GPa 1.4 Mbar 
Center of Earth 6400 360 GPa 3.6 Mbar 
Assertion: Typical "tectonic"  stresses have magnitudes in  the range 0.3 - 300 MPa (3-
3,000 bars). 
Conclusion: In considering t ectonic problems, it is usuall y useful to subtract some 
isotropic reference state of stress. There ar e 2 common choices - the lithostatic stress, 
which leaves the nonlithostatic stress tensor, and the pressure field, which leaves the 
deviatoric stress field. But since we need to  know the actual stress tensor in order to 
calculate the pressure, which requires knowing the solution to the problem in advance, it 
is most common to use the lithostatic stress field as the reference. 
In order to place these comments in context, let's look at the situat ion described in T&amp;S 
problem 2-6, where a continent is in isostati c equilibrium with an ocean. To address the 
possible state of (nonlithostatic) stress in th e region, we will follow an  iterative approach. 
The "algorithm" can go as follows: 
1) Assuming lithostatic stress, calculate the horizontal normal stress as a function of 
depth beneath both the continental and the oceanic structures. 
2) Evaluate the "reasonableness" of th is assumption by making a free body diagram by 
isolating a (thin) vertical "pill box" of material at the continent-ocean boundary and 
calculating the total forces acting on its sides, given this assumption.</text>

          <text>Tensors 
Most physical quantities that are important in continuum mechanics like temperature, 
force, and stress can be represented by a tensor.  Temperature can be specified by stating 
a single numerical value called a scalar and is called a zeroth-orde r tensor.  A force, 
however, must be specified by stating both a ma gnitude and direction.  It is an example of 
a first-order tensor.  Specifying a stress is even more complicated and requires stating a 
magnitude and two directionsthe direction of  a force vector and the direction of the 
normal vector to the plane on which the fo rce acts.  Stresses are represented by second-
order tensors. 
Tensors are quantities independ ent of coordinate system.

Mohrs Circle for Strain 
Lecture 5 explained a simple and convenient way to find the stress on an arbitrary plane 
given the stress tensor  ij. The technique involved writing equations for how the shear 
stress and normal stress on the x 1plane vary when the coordinate system is rotated to x i ' . 
These equations plotted as M ohrs circle in stress space (  , ) and gave the tractions on 
plane x ' at angle  to the most compressive principle stress. 1
Since strain is a second-order tensor like stress, the same technique can be applied.  
Equations for the normal strain and shear strain on a plane at angle  to the most 
compressive principle strain may be derived in the same way the equations for stress 
were derived. Consider the followi ng transformation of coordinates:

 Tensors  
 
Most physical quantities that are im portant in continuum  mechanics like tem perature, 
force, and stress can b e represen ted b y a tens or.  Tem perature can be specified by stating 
a single numerical value called a scalar and is called a zero th-order tensor.  A force, 
however, must be specified by stating both a m agnitude and direction.  It is an exam ple 
of a first-order tensor.  S pecifying a stress is  even  more com plicated and requires s tating 
a magnitude and two directionsthe direction of a force vector and the direction of the 
norm al vector to the plane on which the for ce acts.  Stresses are repres ented by secon d-
order tensors.   
 
 The Stress T ensor 
 
Representin g a force in three dim ensions re quires three num bers, each referenced to a 
coordinate axis.  Representi ng the state of stress in thr ee dim ensions requires nine 
numbers, each referenced to a coordinate  axis and a plane perpendicu lar to the 
coordinate axes.  To understand what each of the nine num bers m eans, it is helpful to 
visualize an infinitesim ally sm all cube in  a continuous m edium, oriented in a 3D 
coordinate system . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The coordinate system has axes x 1, x2, x3 normal to the faces of the cube.  The faces of 
the cube are defined by unit normal vectors 3 2 1, ,x x x)))that are positive when pointing out 
from the cube.

          <text>Adm ontons Law  
 
Adm ontons law relates a norm al force a nd a tan gential force by a proportionality 
constan t called the coefficient of static friction fs: 
 
normal s gential Ff F  =tan   
 
Dividing both sides of the equation by the area A over which the forces ac t leads to 
Adm ontons law in te rms of  traction s: 
 
n sf   =  
   
 
 
 
  
As shown in the picture, Admontons law expresses a failure criterion.  When the 
tangential force is larger than the product of the normal force and fs, the block in the 
picture will slide down the incline.  This failu re criterion will help solve the problem of 
houses sliding into the ocean in Southern  California.  The problem in Southern 
California, though, is more difficult than the block problem because it is unclear which 
plane below the house has n and   that will cause failure.   
 
The rest of this lecture and the next one will address this difficulty.  It will explore how 
to completely represent the state of stress below the house at any point, how to find the 
traction on an arbitrary plane below the house,  and how to evaluate which one of those 
planes will fail.   
 
3. Tractions at a point Figure by MIT  OCW.
Motivation  
 Tractions at a point are difficult to conceptu alize because the area at  a point over which a 
force acts is infinitesimal.  Despite this difficulty, the concept of  point tractions is 
extremely important because it allows one to  find the traction on an arbitrary plane.

 Newtons Laws and the Traction at a Point  
 
Newtons third law says that the force exerte d by Part 2 of the body on Part 1 is equal 
and opposite to the force exerted by Part 1 on Part 2.  What about the point traction  
 T(-n) exerted by Part 1 on Part 2? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Applying Newtons second law to both parts of the body and the body as a whole reveals 
that  T(-n) is equal to T(n).  For a complete treatment of the problem see pages 50-51 in 
Continuum Mechanics for Engineers  by Mase and Mase.

Notes on the Orientation of Surfaces  
 
Traction depends on the area of the surface over which it acts.  Since area often changes 
with the orientation of th e surface, the values of n and   do not behave like vector 
components when the surface orientation changes.  Consider the following figure:

The decomposition of tractions into normal and shear components is useful in writing

          <text>Lecture 2 :  Stress 
 
Geophysicists study phenom ena such as seism icity, plate tectonics, a nd the slow flow of 
rocks and minerals called creep.  One way they study these phenom ena is by 
investigating the deformation and flow of  Earth m aterials.  T he scien ce of the 
defor mation and flow of m aterials is called rheology.   
The funda mental concepts of rheology ar e stress and strain.  Stress is a dym anic 
quantity that expresses the m agnitude of fo rces acting with in or at the surface of 
continuous m edia and strain is a kin ematic quantity that expresses deform ation of the 
media.  This lectu re introduces the b asic concepts of stress.  It explains how to 
completely describ e an objects s tate of st ress in a 3D coordinate system  and how to 
change the coordinate system  for convenience.  It also de scribes how to find the stress 
on an arbitrary plane within an object and how  to determ ine if  the stress o n that p lane 
will cau se the objec t to b reak.  
 
1. ForcesSurface Forces and Body Forces 
 
Surface forces are d ifferent from  body forces.  For exam ple, consider pu shing a rock off 
the edge of a cliff.  Pushing the rock involves a surface force that acts on an area 
bounding part of the rock.  Dropping it off the cliff involves gravity, a body force that 
acts throughout the volu me of the rock and depends on its m ass. 
 
2. Tractions 
 
Motiva tion 
 
If you push a balloon with your foot, it wi ll slide across the ground.  If you push a 
balloon with the sam e force using a needle, it will pop.  The difference results from  the 
fact that a n eedle and a foot apply fo rce ove r a different surface area of the balloon.  T he 
needle applies force over a very sm all ar ea and produces a large traction.  The foot 
applies force over a m uch bigger area and produces a sm aller traction.      
 
Definition

2. Indirect Measurement of Strain 
 
In addition to using the techniques listed above, strain can sometimes be measured indirectly by observing the ch ange in shape of objects that  naturally have a certain 
geometry.  For example, a geologist may comp are the deformed shape of fossils, pebbles, 
or veins in an outcrop to their undeformed shape to determine the presence of tension, shear, or compression.

The last lecture explained the basic ideas about strain and introduced the strain tensor.  
This lecture explores a few different ways to measure stra in and explains how strain, like 
stress, can be represented graphically using Mohrs circle. 
1. Measuring Techniques 
a. Leveling 
Leveling uses a level telescope and two measuri ng sticks to measure the vertical distance 
between two points.

to read signals from space.  In VBLI, this si gnal comes from quasars.  In GPS, the signal 
comes from a satellite.

Stress Rotation, after Z oback et al, 1987 
 
The principal stress directions are observed to rotate in the vic inity of  the S an Andreas 
fault (SAF). In the far-field (e.g., Nevada), th e maximum compressive stress is oriented at 
an angle to the fault trace  ~ 55. But in the near fi eld, this angle, now called , is clo se 
to 85. (Note that this is th e sam e as the angle between the lea st com pressive stre ss and

2. Mohrs Circle 
 
Motivation
 
Lecture II explained that an object resting on a slope will slide down when the shear 
traction on the slope is greater than or equal to the product of the normal traction and the 
coefficient of friction. 
 
n sf =  
 
On a shallow slope, n is large and the object will not  slide.  On a steep slow,  is large 
and the object will slide.  For any plane with normal , we can calculate if the plane will 
fail if the stress tensor n
ij at the interface between the obj ect and the slope is known.  
Calculate n and ,  as follows:

          <text>Deriving Mohrs Circle
 
Mohrs circle may be derived in two or th ree dimensions.  This lecture explains the 
derivation in two dimensions because it is more  straightforward and the results are easier 
to graph and understand.  The derivation assumes that x 1, x2, and x 3 are principle 
directions.  
 
Consider the following figure in which the x i coordinate system is rotated clockwise 
about the x 3 axis to x i:

          <text>Interpreting Mohrs circle
 
Mohrs circle plots in stress space.  Admontons law may also  be plotted in stress space 
as a line with slope fs.  When this line and Mohrs circle intersect, the criterion for failure 
across a plane is met.   
 
Consider a common experiment in rock mechanics in which scientists apply a uniaxial 
stress 2 to a cylindrical sample confined by a uniform stress 1.   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Admontons law and the Mohrs circle that represents the state of stress are plotted 
below.  The Mohrs circle plots on the negative n axis because these notes follow the 
convention that compressive stresses are negative.  1 plots farther to the right because s2

of the convention that 1 is greater than 2, and 2 is greater than 3.  The line that 
represents Admontons law crosses the  axis at o, the shear strength of the rock. Figure 5.5</text>

Since most rocks have a coefficient of fric tion of about 0.6, the normal vector to the 
failure plane is typically 30 from the direction of the least compressive stress.  Another 
way of saying this is that the failure plane is 30 from the direction of the most 
compressive stress.   
 
  
Faulting
 
Faults are large-scale failure planes.  Sin ce failure planes are normal to the  plane 
containing the least compressive and the most  compressive stresses and are typically at 
30from the direction of the most compressive stress, different styles of faulting can be 
used to infer the directions of 1, 2, and 3. 
 
The following diagram shows the deviatoric stresses associated w ith thrust faults, 
normal faults, and strike-slip faults.  The pictures assume that x 2 is vertical and that x 1 
and x 3 lie in the plane of the surface of the Earth. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The above picture shows that  the coefficient of fricti on determines the slope of 
Admontons law, and the slope of Admontons law determines 2.  Consequently, 
predicting the failure plane of  a rock only requires knowing the direction of the most 
compressive stress 2, the direction of the least compressive stress 1, and the coefficient 
of friction fs.  The table below lists the angle between 1 and the normal vector to the 
failure plane for different values of fs.</text>

          <text>Lecture 5:  Changing Coordinate  System s and Mohrs Circle 
 
Lecture 2 ex plained that tem perature is a zeroth -order tensor, force is  a first-order tensor, 
and stress is a second-order tens or.   The order of  a tensor  is called its rank and is 
defined by its law of transfor mation under a chan ge of coordinates.  This lecture explains 
the transform ation laws for first- and second-or der tensors, and uses these laws to derive 
a convenient representation of stress called Mohrs circle. 
 
1. Transform ing Tensors into Di fferent Coordinate System s 
 
Changing coordinate system s
 
In order to transform  a tensor into a di fferent coordinate sy stem, one m ust first 
understand how to transfor m the coordinate syst em itself.  Consider the following figure:

If and represent unit vectors that are the axes  of two coordinate systems with the 
same origin, they are related by the equation 'ixjx
 
j ij ix x '=  
where ij is the cosine of the angle between the primed axis and the unprimed axis .  
For example, 'ixjx
12 is the cosine of the angle between and .   '1x2x ji represents a 9-
component matrix called the transformation ma trix.  Unlike the stre ss tensor, it is not 
symmetric ( ij  ji).

          <text>Life becomes complicated.  In particular, it' s important to know whether one is coming or 
going: 
 Reference frame : 
Consider a medium undergoing motion &amp; deform ation, with the displacement a (vector) 
function of position. 
x3 B 
x2 a 
b u A 
x1 
Fig. 10_2 
bj = f(a i) 
or 
bj = bj(ai) 
Since the mapping a i &lt;&gt; b j is one-to-one, we could also say 
aj= aj(bi). 
It turns out (consider the tele phone book example in cl ass) that the description of strain 
depends on whether the reference frame is: 
Lagrangian  fixed to particles (the "a" frame) 
ui = bi(aj) - ai 
Example:  elasticity -- the partic les return to where they started</text>

          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>sin a = 2E 12/[(1 + E 11) (1 + E 22)]1/2 
These quantities go to the infinitesimal values when E ij &lt;&lt; 1. 
Because e ij  Eij, the principal values &amp; principal directions of the Lagrangian and 
Eulerian strain tensors differ.  We will discuss these later. 
Consider two particles initially separated by dai (note: not just a function of strain tensor) 
which undergo a displacement uj, and are then separated by dxi. 
Lagrangian : 
ui  
dxi = dai + daj = 
ij + ui  
dajaj aj 
This can be written, including the finite strain tensor, 
 uj uu  ui uj us u  
daj s s sdxi = ij + 1  ui +
ai +  + 1   
 2  aj ai aj  2  aj ai ai aj   
=[ij + ij +ij ]daj 
ij  Lagrangian rotation tensor 
if Eij = 0  rotation alone 
Similarly, for the Eulerian  case: 
1  ui uj us us =  +ij 2  bj bi bi bj  
dai =[ij + eij +ij ]dxj 
for small deformation:  ij rotation needed to bring a fiber dai into position. 
For large deformation: no easy way to sepa rate into pure rotation and pure shearthe 
two are intimately connected. 
THIS IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN PROBLEMS LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROCK FABRIC .

          <text>Eulerian  fixed to space (the "b" frame) 
ui = bi -ai(bj) 
Example:  fluid mechanics, geology -- no idea where the particles started or where 
they will end up; no stable frame fixed to the materials. 
Finite strain depends on whether the reference frame is fixed to the particle or to "space:" 
Lagrangian strain: E ij = (ui/aj + uj/ai + ul/ai ul/aj)/2 
Eulerian strain:  e ij = (ui/bj + uj/bi -ul/bi ul/bj)/2 
When strain is small, the 3rd term is small 2, and both strains converg e to the infinitesmal 
value. Physical interpretation:

Finite Strain 
The "paradox" of finite strain and prefe rred orientation  pure vs. simple shear 
Suppose: 1) Anisotropy de velops as mineral grains grow such that they are 
preferentially oriented with the "easy slip" direction facilitating deformation. 
2) New grain growth is determined  by the state of stress.  (What else 
would a mineral grain "know" about?) 
3) The state of stress for pure shea r and simple shear are identical  pure 
and simple shear stress differ only by a ro tation of 45 in coordinate system. 
4) In pure shear there is only one s lip direction, whereas in pure shear, 2 
systems could be active. 
Paradox: If the stress state is the same, how do es the rock "know" to  have 1 preferred 
orientation in simple shear, but not in pure shear? 
Fig. 10_1 
Up to now, we have considered  infinitesimal strain, where e ij = (ui/xj + uj/xi)/2 &lt;&lt;1. 
For the kinds of deformations common in stru ctural geology, as well as for the deforming 
telephone book example shown in class, this condition of "infinitesimal" deformation no 
longer holds.</text>

Application  
 
Plane stress is useful because it often m odels the tecton ic stress in the lithosphere.  Under 
the conditions of plane stress, the total stress tensor is a co mbination of lithostatic stress

Previous lectures explained that second-order tensors prov ide a relationshi p between two 
first-order tensors.  Lecture V, for exam ple, explained that stress is  a second-order tensor 
that rela tes the norm al vector of  a plane to the traction v ector on tha t plane.  Constitu tive 
equations relate two second-or der tensors by using a fourth-order tensor.  The general 
form of the equation for elasticity, for exam ple, is given by 
 
kl ijkl ijc =  
 
where cijkl is the fourth-order el astic modulus tensor.  It has 81 com ponents. 
 
There are too m any components of the elastic m odulus tensor to work with easily.  
However, it can be reduced to fewer com ponents using argum ents of symm etry and 
energy.  The fact that the stress and strain  tensors are symm etric reduces the num ber of 
components to 36.  This num ber can be furt her reduced to 21 by considering constraints 
on strain energy.  For a full treatm ent of th e strain energy argum ent, see pages 56-58 in 
Rheology of the Earth  by Ranalli.  L astly, by ass uming the mater ial is isotropic, the 
elastic m odulus tensor can be reduced to  
 
( )jk il jl ik kl ij ijklc    + + =

reduce the L am para meters to conven tional and more m anageable m oduli. 
 
a.  Hydrostatic com pression 
 
In hydrostatic com pression, all shear stresses are zero and all norm al stresses are equal:

          <text>Lecture 11:  Introduction to Consti tutive Equations and Elasticity 
 
Previous lectures developed the concepts a nd mathematics of stress and strain.  The 
equations developed in these lectures such  as Cauchys formula and Newtons second 
law were derived from laws of physics and ar e valid for all continuous media.  The next 
couple of lectures explain the relationships between stress and strain.  These 
relationships are called constitutive equations and apply to only specific idealized 
materials.  For example, constitutive equa tions characterize the behavior of viscous 
fluids and perfectly elastic solids. 
 
1. Elasticity 
 
Introduction
 
Elasticity is an important phenomenon in Ea rth Science because rocks behave elastically 
at conditions prevalent in most of the upper lithosphere:  low temperature and pressure.  
Elastic behavior means that a rock deforms instantly under the appli cation of a load and 
that the strain is linearly proportional to st ress.  Once the load is removed, all of the 
strain is recovered.  These characteristics of elastic behavior are shown graphically 
below.

   The picture on the left shows strain as a function of time for an elastic body under a constant 
stress applied at t 0.  The picture on the right shows that strain is linearly proportional to stress in 
an elastic body.
