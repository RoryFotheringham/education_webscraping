Meeting : October 20, 2003 
Film : Werner Herzog, Stroszek, 1976 
There simply isn't another movie in the world quite like Stroszek. Part 
biography, both of its director and of its star; part bitter satire of the American dream, part loving tribute to America; part tragedy, part comedy; this film is an ungainly, lovable, heartbreaking mess of a movie that I think I could watch again and again. It is, in its own way, absolutely perfect. Michael W. Phillips Jr, 2002 
1. Looking at the actors: the merging between reality and fiction 
2. The landscapes of America in Werner Herzogs Stroszek 
3. Mythology and reality in the film</text>
