          <text>Neural circuitry of depression
The hippocampus and the prefrontal 
cortex were the main focus for a 
while in depression. 
Recent research has focused on 
other subcortical structures: nucleus 
accumbens, amygdala and the 
hypothalamus. 
Monoaminergic (NEergic/5-HTergic) 
neurons are particularly important in 
establishing the neural circuitry in 
depres sion Figures removed due to copyright restrictions.</text>

          <text>Depression - treatment
	The treatment of depression was revolutioniz ed 50 years ago, 
when two classes of agents were discovered: the tricyclic 
antidepressants (TCA) and the m onoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOI) 
	The original TCA agents (imipram ine) arose from antihistamine 
research; MAOI arose from antitubercular drugs 
	More recently, led to the disco very of serotonin-selective 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and norepinephrine-selective 
inhibitors.</text>

          <text>Monoaminergic hypothesis of 
depression
	Most ADs increase levels of monoamine serotonin 
(5-HT) and/or noradrenaline (NA) 
	Biochemical imbalance in the 5-HT/NA system may
underlie the pathogenesis of these disorders 
	ADs produce a rapid increase in extracellular levels 
of 5-HT and NA 
	Onset of clinical effects usually takes 3-4 weeks; this
suggests neurochemical and structural changes in 
the limbic target areas of monoaminergic projections</text>

          <text>Conclusions
	Latency to feed in a novel environment is decreased 
specifically by chronic, not acute treatment with
antidepressants (SSRIs or TCAs) 
	Antidepressants cause increased neurogenesis in 
SGZ 
	Activation of 5-HT1A receptor is a critical component
in the action of SSRIs, but not TCAs 
	Disrupting hippocampal neurogenesis with                
X-irradiation blocks the effects of chronic AD 
treatment

	AD treatment caused a reduction in latency to feed, but this effect was
absent in irradiated mice

 Should there be large (&gt;10,000) samples for new searches 
for risk genes for bipolar illness and schizophrenia?
 Can the field risk not using new technologies on such large 
sample numbers to try to achieve discoveries with concrete 
practical application to diagnosis and therapy and refine syndromes based upon shared genetic and molecular structures?
 If this is not done, what are the chances of quantal 
improvement in our understanding of bipolar illness and schizophrenia?</text>

 Partially effective well-documented treatments for mental illnesses 
have been available for many decades
 Limited understanding of the dis ease mechanisms and how 
existing treatments work has impeded the discovery of more

 Drug discovery must move toward a new paradigm based on 
understanding disease mechanisms, defining biochemical targets, and a sufficiently large and rigorous clinic

there was no evidence of comprehension difficulties being 
associated either with maternal rejection or with any particularCOMT genotype; in addition, there were no associations between specific COMT genotypes and maternal rejection.
four sets of logistic regressions were investigated, one for each of the studied COMT polymor phisms. Specifically, these 
analyses were conceived to esta blish (a) the contributions of 
the genotypes at the four COMT polymorphisms to comprehension difficulties ( present = 1, absent =0), (b) the contribution of maternal rejection ( present =1, absent = 0) to comprehension difficulties, and (c) interactive contributions ofgenotypes and maternal rejection to comprehension difficulties.</text>

Given a variety of evidence implicating the prefrontal

Variants of COMT influence cognitive function
specific neurocognitive processes involved continue to be a matter of debate
Part of the difficulty is distinguishing between false positives, pleiotropy and the influence of a general

          <text>DARPP-32 AND CDK5
CDK5 - Cyclin-dependent kinase 
The association of Cdk5 with one of its neuron-specific co-
activators, p35 or p39, is required in processes such as neurite outgrowth, axonal migration, cortical lamination, control of cell adhesion, axonal transport, synaptic activity, neuronal adaptive changes and motor functions 
DARPP-32 is a Cdk5 substrate that plays a key role in the biology of medium spiny dopaminoceptive GABAergic 
neurons in the striatum, a nevralgic structure modulating 
voluntary motor movements and motivational behavior.

Schizophrenics have increased release of DA and 
increased density and occupancy of D2R in striatum
Most antipsychotics = block D2R (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, perphenazine  but all cause neurologic symptoms: tremor, rigidity, dystonia, dyskinesia)

          <text>Mechanism of COMT-
polymorphismsSavitz, Solms, Ramesar 2006
Usually DA released diffuses and binds to extrasynaptic 
D1R and inactivated by COMT
High-activity val COMT decreases extrasynaptic DA and D1R activation, shifting balance to intrasynaptic D2R activation
Therefore (and this is supported by human studies)
Val-allele results in lowered stability of PFC networks decreased maintenance WM, but enhanced update of WM with new info
Met-allele results in elevated PDF [DA] and D1R 
enhanced stability of PFC networks and maintenance of 
information, but less cognitive flexibility</text>

MBCOMT appears to have higher affinity for the 
catecholamine neurotransmitters and plays an important role in their cortical metabolism. 
In turn, catecholamines are intimately, although not exclusively, involved in many psychological functions, learning notwithstanding.
COMT higher in males in prefrontal cortex (Chen et al 2004)
The male COMT knockout mouse shows a substantial 
increase in dopamine levels in the basal tissue, an increase 
not registered in females (Gogos et al., 1998)</text>

          <text>DARPP-32 regulates PP-1 and PKA
Activation of PKA or PKG stimulates DARPP-32 
phosphorylation at Thr34 and thereby converts DARPP-32  into a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1). 
DARPP-32 is also phosphorylated at Thr75 by Cdk5 and this converts DARPP-32 into an inhibitor of PKA.
Thus, DARPP-32 has the unique pr operty of being a dual-function 
protein, acting either as an inhibitor of PP-1 or of PKA.
The state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34 depends on the phosphorylation state of two serine 
residues, Ser102 and Ser137, which are phosphorylated 
by CK2 and CK1, respectively.</text>

          <text>DAT1
Previous research has generated examples of how genetic and 
environmental factors can interact to create risk for psychopathology. 
Using a gene-by-environment (G  E) interaction design, theytested 
whether three polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene 
(DAT1, also referred to as SLC6A3 , located at 5p15.33) interacted 
with maternal parenting style to  predict first onset episodes of
depression. 
Participants were male adolescents (176) recruited from a juvenile 
detention center in northern Russia. 
As hypothesized, one of the polymorphisms (rs40184) moderated the 
effect of perceived maternal re jection on the onset of major 
depressive disorder, as well as on suicidal ideation. 
Further, this G  E interaction was specific to depression; it did not 
predict clinically significant anxiety.Haeffel et al 2008</text>

          <text>DARPP-32 AND CDK5
DARPP-32 and PPI-1 are thus bifunctional signal transduction 
elements which modulate PKA signaling in response to their 
phosphorylation by Cdk5. 
D1 and D2 dopamine receptors found on the GABAergic 
dopaminoceptive medium spiny neurons of the striatum regulate 
motor behavioral functions by initiating the mutual and 
antagonistic actions of Cdk5 and PKA through balancing of kinaseand phosphatase activities.
In the neo-striatum, activation of metabotropic glutamatergic 
receptors increases Cdk5 and casein kinase-1 activity, resulting in the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr 75 and Ser 137, 
respectively. 
Kinase inhibitor studies on neostriatal slices indicate that casein kinase-1 may function upstream of Cdk5 Nguyen et al 2002</text>

 Transgenic models:
 Li et al (PNAS, 2007, 104, 18282)
 C-terminal portion of DISC1 (aa 671-852) was fused to estrogen 
receptor and driven by the CaMKII promoter
 Induction of expression for only 24 hr at P7
 reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity in adult
 depressive-like traits, abnormal spatial working memory, and reduced 
sociability.
 Results suggest that alterations of DISC1 function during brain 
development contribute to behavioral phenotypes

 Reduced cortical size and enlarged 
ventricles
 Q31L showed depressive-like behavior 
with deficits in the forced swim test and 
other measures
 L100P mutant mice exhibited 
schizophrenic-like behavior, with profound deficits in prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition
 However, neither of these residues are 
conserved in humans

Duan et al (Cell, 2007, 130:1146)
 DISC1 RNAi knockdown leads to 
accelerated migration and mis-
positioning of newly born neurons 
during adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus
 newborn neurons with DISC1 
knockdown exhibit enhanced 
excitability and accelerated 
dendritic development and synapse formation
 Interactions with Nudel and Lis1 
essential for the function of DISC1
These results obtained from DISC1 loss of function
in adult brain are opposite from those of A Sawa et 
al and A. Silva et al where they showed that DISC1
loss of function impaired neuronal migration and
reduced dendritic complexity Courtesy Elsevier, Inc., h ttp://www.sciencedirect.com. Used with permission.</text>
