Kaizen-Teian vs. Business Process Reengineering
Adapted  from ESD.60 Systems Change Debate Results on 6/14/2004
Part I: Introduction Part II: Concepts Part III: Application Part IV: Disconnects Part V: ConclusionBig change:  enabling element to 
get on the next S curve
Lead by example:  management is 
willing to change
See the entire system:  avoid 
negative outcome of seemingly 
unrelated local improvements that are 
in fact related
Drastic changes are not easy
Push system:  not necessarily 
customers-focused and may 
undermine organizational identity
May results in layoffs that might 
chill participationIncremental, long-term improvement 
process driven by workforceEmpowers workers who are closer 
to the process and build unity in 
organization
Benefit from the insight of those 
closest to the processNot as disruptive
Workforce may only achieve local 
optimum but not global optimum
Process being improved might be 
inherently flawedDifficult to engage everyone in the 
organizationBusiness Process

Food For Thought
Characterizing kaizen as simply "continuous 
improvement" trivializes the concept and portrays it as cautious and lacking in imagination... More typically, the implementation of kaizen reflects a radical commitment to an entire way of operating that requires floor-to-ceiling change in management, work, manager-worker relationships, discipline, decision making, and the organization of knowledge, that transforms an organization into a federation of problem solvers.

NUMMI plant:  10,000 suggestions per year with 
4,000 workers for the last 20 years.
At the end of 4 years, Nippondenso had made so 
many improvements that it had maxed out the 
existing system, and a re-engineering (with new 
equipment) was implemented.  This works well with 
NUMMIs product cycle (~4 years).  This is also 
consistent with the graph on slide 6.NUMMI plant 1-2 min700 people at the plant:  implementing 7000 
improvement suggestions per year.
calculated both dollar returns and intangibles, in 
which dollar returns were not calculable80% of suggestions were intangibleswhy?
Important to build capability; each time people 
made a suggestion, they learned how to make 
better improvement suggestions.  Soon the people 
who suggested intangibles suggested tangibles.
7000 seems too high to implement.  Do they all go 
through PDCA?Yes, but through distributed leadership.  Not top-
down.

Discussion
Supporting IT infrastructure is important for tracking 
suggestions and delivering metrics
Re-engineering often punctuates successful kaizen programs, because incremental learning can max out 
the existing system
Dollar values are not always the best metric for kaizen
80% of suggested improvements at one auto parts factory were 
intangiblesbut were important in their own right and they were necessary to build suggestion-making capability
PDCA should be done on all suggestionsbut from the 
bottom up.</text>

Common Disconnects/Roadblocks in Kaizen Implementation
Technical Factors
Little visible technical 
impediment on kaizen.  
Measurement metrics for kaizen efforts.Social Factors
Overly formalizing the kaizen process will collapse the 
improvement program.
Competition between departments on kaizen can 
be both positive and 
negative.
Negative workers-
management friction will 
impede the kaizen process.
Lack of management commitment to kaizen can 
impede the improvement 
program.

4-Stage Implementation of Kaizen 
at Algonquin Automotive
Stage 1:  Kaizen Kick-off
Highly visible, formal, structured implementation 1 year -18 months
Kaizen events inspired by Toyota:  1-3 days when the lines are stopped
Each meeting was carefully documented, and follow-up meetings were held.
Full of energy:  all improvements were encouraged by management.
Stage 2:  Kaizen Attenuated
Effort collapsed under its own weight, causing kaizen to receive lower 
priority
Workers focused on getting production out of the door.  Taking an hour out of 
work was viewed as infeasible.
Stage 3:  Quiet Resurrection
Individuals in various departments started kaizen efforts on an ad-hoc basis
Non-coordinated, scattered efforts across the organization
Stage 4:  Kaizen Returns
Both the organization and depts recognize individuals kaizen efforts 
Standardized kaizen documentation and performance measurements
More focused on direct groups; little inter-departmental communication

What is Kaizen-Teian?
Part I: Introduction Part II: Concepts Part III: Application Part IV: Disconnects Part V: Conclusion (Kaizen):  improvement
 (Teian):  proposal
Characteristics of Kaizen-Teian:
Gradual and continuous accumulation of small improvements
Focus on team of collaborators (v s. team of exper ts/consultants), 
engage the entire workforce
Promote a maintained progress (vs. lack of continuity)
Implement incremental improvements in small steps (vs. big leaps)
Is a building block of a typical lean organization.  (The other building 
block is identifying waste in operations.)
Typical setting:  a small team of  8-20 people from all levels and 
functions/departments of  the organization identifying, analyzing, and 
implementing a project in a matter of 4-5 days.

Concluding Comments
Kaizen-Teian emphasizes Just Do It!
Kaizen-Teian is a building block of a typical lean organization.
Kaizen-Teian is a gradual and continuous accumulation of small 
improvements and focuses on a team of collaborators .
Kaizen-Teian treats every variance from target as a problem to be 
solved and everyone in the organizati on as a responsib le contributor.
Standardization and measurements ar e the keys to successful 
Kaizen-Teian efforts.
No single program solves all the operational problems in a 
manufacturing environment.

07/07/04 --  Bruce Pan/Nicholas SvenssonESD.60 Lean/Six Sigma Systems, LFM, MIT Attributes of a push System 
Manufacturing activities are planned based on a market 
forecast rather than actual customer demand. 
Implicitly this means: 
There is an emphasis placed on a central planning funct
Service levels are assured by increasing or decreasing finished goods 
inventory levels. 
The system optim zes efficiency rather than effectiveness by leve
loading the factory. 
Material flows through the factory in batches following a prescribed 
routing sheet attached to the work order. 
There is a heavy reliance on heuristics to compensate for the inherent 
complex ty of the optimization problems encountered. 
planning horizons and fences are used to adjust the production 
plan on a weekly or monthly basis based on the forecast. 
Distinction between dependant and ndependent demand. 
Adapted  from MIT LFM  thesis by Sean Hilbert 
Part I: Introduction Part II: Concepts Part III: Application Part IV: Disconnects Part V: Conclusion 
Highlight some of the majo r implicit features  time fences, fore cast driven, complic ated heuristics and 
computer delegated decision making.  Works very well  in a stable environment  key is the discussion of 
how the system behaves in a changing environment.  i.e. how do you deal with ch ange and what are some 
of the system constraints inherent with a push system.

The Ice Cream Parlor 
Exercise 
 
 


07/07/04 --  Bruce Pan/Nicholas SvenssonESD.60 Lean/Six Sigma Systems, LFM, MIT The scenario 
There are two competing ice cream parlors.  Both located 
on Newbury St. in Boston. 
The first is located at the corner of Newbury St. and 
Arlington St.  It is named the 5 Scoops or 5S by the locals.  
It is a lean operation with limited shop floor space. 
The second is located at the corner of Newbury St. and 
Exeter St.  It is named Dairystein in honor of the 
companies herd of milking cows.  
Part I: Introduction Part II: Concepts Part III: Application Part IV: Disconnects Part V: Conclusion 
The purpose of the exercise is to  examine how two organizations wit hin the same industry can operate 
given two different operating systems.  The 5S parlo r utilizes a pull system and the Dairystein utilizes a 
push system.  As the demand uncertaint y is the same for both each team is forced to make compromises 
on their business strategy based on the constraints pl aced upon them by their supply chain models. The 
inherent constraint in the lean case is the kanban re plenishment rate.  The inhere nt restriction in the push 
case is the herd size and the continuous requirement to milk the h erd regardless of dem and.  It is hoped 
that by the end of the ex ercise the teams would hav e approximately equal prof its and when asked wou ld 
have similar ideas on how to improve their supply ch ains.  Depending on the demand profile provided 
during the exercise it should be po ssible to demonstrate the benefits of  a push system in dealing with short 
term forecast variations (hockey stick) versus the bene fits of a lean system in de aling with a more even but 
still uncertain de mand profile.

Part I: Introduction Part II: Concepts Part III: Application Part IV: Disconnects Part V: Conclusion 
Some of the more common disconnects typically c aused when the systems undergo dynamic change or 
have to deal with uncertainty.  With ei ther system it isnt practical to discuss any aspect of change until 
stability has been reached. This is  the first and most important cons ideration for both systems.  How 
stability is achieved is based on t he business realities of each company.

FDM Implementation Details 
Problem Statement:Problem Statement:
Raw materials are driven by SIOP calculable &amp; 
forecasted demand. SIOP end-item forecast accuracyranges from 15% - 65%, and is highly variable over time. 
Master schedule is driven based off these firm and 
forecast requirements. 
Project Definition:Project Definition:
De-couple the SIOP forecast from the supply chain to 
establish a process that: 
 Provides increased stability to the supply chain 
 Reduces inventory levels 
 Improves material availability 
Drive the master schedule based upon historic demand
and variation data, coupled with forward-lookingaggregate demand trends. Partner with suppliers,
manufacturing and the customer to manage a stable 
supply chain. Actions Taken:Actions Taken:
Simulation on 30 part numbers 
Completed FDM FMEA

Toni Albers LFM 00 
Emphasize that this is a long term commitment to lean implementation taking many years. To fully 
transform a supply chain from push to pull can take 10-15 years based on Toni Albers input.  Honeywell 
have a 5 year implementation strategy  of which the FDM initiative is a part. There are also multiple 
challenges with mindset an d overall organizational norms which need to be overcome when implementing 
lean in a Brownfield site. Some of these include ba tch building, weekly rather than daily ship targets, 
disconnecting Master Scheduling fr om Shop Orders etc.. All of th ese take time and the eventual 
implementation of many lean principles culminating in an implementation of a hybrid model.

07/07/04 --  Bruce Pan/Nicholas SvenssonESD.60 Lean/Six Sigma Systems, LFM, MIT Concluding Comments 
Continuous improvement and removal of waste applies equal
well to both push and pull systems. 
The entire supp y chain needs to be considered for either 
system. 
Pull systems provide v sual and real-time feedback for 
improvement. Push systems tend to hide ineff ciencies. 
Pull systems require more col aboration with suppliers as they 
expose to inventory-carrying cost via the kanbans. 
Part I: Introduction Part II: Concepts Part III: Application Part IV: Disconnects Part V: Conclusion 
Lean principles apply equally well to both push and pull systems.  Getting rid of waste and impr oving agility 
and flexibility help both systems to be effective, efficient and predictable.  Typically it is easier to postpone 
dealing with problems in a push rather than a pull system due to the extra inventory and lack of immediate 
feedback of urgency. This however also tends to be one of the signif icant Achilles heals of the push 
system.

Have two teams of 5 participate.  I person from each te am should witness the other team during the 
simulation to ensure consistent adhe rence to the rule s of engagement. 
Each team fills in column  1 of the tables on charts 16-17 with their initial ka nban sizes and herd sizes 
respectively.  These optimum esti mates should be a best guess based on the above forecast statement 
and other background informat ion provided on slide 15.  
The simulation starts with the initial high of the day being given and each team completes column 1.  The 
profit is recorded and c harted on the black board on an x-y chart ($profit vs. day).  Once complete the 
second days high temperature is pr ovided and the days act ual demand calculated.  Each team can now 
begin to re optimize or leave thei r supply chains alone.  The pull group can change th eir kanban size, 
which takes 5 days.  This is to reflect the amount of time required to reach cons ensus in the whole supply 
chain.  Alternatively the push team can choose to buy milk externally which has a 2 day delay associated 
with it.

Summary and Questions 
 Takt time is the rhythm or heartbeat at which an organization
should operate 
 A truly Lean operation will synchronize takt and cycle times as
well as make sure that operational takt times meet customer
demand 
 Taken alone takt time can lead to disconnects and issues, but 
within a Lean mind frame it is a powerful tool

one unit of production output.** 
*CUSTOMER DRIVEN: Available Operating Time / Customer Demand 
*OPERATION DRIVEN:

Takt Time of 1.4 Hours 
entire manufacturing operation 
Takt Time differs from Cycle Time, which is the actual time 
it takes to make one unit of production output. 
28/04 -- Colin Ducharme and Todd Ruddick]  ESD.60 Lean/Six Sigma Systems, LFM, MIT e.g.-- 8 hours of Daily Operating Time / 4 units of daily demand = 
Takt Time of 2 Hours

 How well do the operational takt times meet the 
customer demand? 
 Are the takt times and cycle times synchronized? 
 What percentage of operations are controlled by takt time? 
 Is there a system in place to handle fluctuations in customer demand? (Overtime, temporary workers, etc.) 
 Does the plant conform to the takt time and not deviate 
from following it? Measures of Takt Time Implementation 
It is necessary to evaluate the implementation of a takt time

Appendix: Instructors Comments and Class 
Discussion for 8.1 
 Takt time is at the heart of a value stream map 
 Operations on the critical path work to the takt time, 
regulated by the constraint in the process 
 Feeder operations need not work to the takt time, but as waste 
is eliminated, interdependency increases and the takt time 
becomes more relevant

Takt Time Disconnects 
 Technical Factors 
 
set the takt time for each 
operation 
 Once the operational takt
time is set it can be very
difficult to change(example: speeding up or
slowing down an assembly
line) 
 Hard to control customer demand fluctuations (order
stability) 
 Difficult to ensure processes remain in
control  Social Factors 
 Workforce can be resistive to being told what speed
to work at 
 A company controlled by
finance may throw the
system out of whack by
forcing products to be
made in order to 
meet/exceed a quarter
point 
 Lack of trust in managementscommitment to employees 
improve a process if
management will just lay

Application Exercise 
 Need a Volunteer 
 Instructions: 
1. Volunteer will be given 30 seconds to review the design of the 
part to be assembled 
2. Compete head-to-head with instructor to determine who can 
assemble part the fastest while maintaining an appropriate 
level of quality 
3. Competitor is to receive component parts in a standard box typical of most supplier deliveries 
4. Instructor to receive component parts in a manner designed by 
a lean implementation team 
5. Readyset...go!!

Example of Marketplace at Visteon 
 Visteon has developed marketplaces to hold parts for 
upstream operations. A marketplace is like a general store 
where personnel get their screws or other components 
instead of walking down the line to get them out of a 
bucket . With a marketplace, lift trucks are no longer 
needed . In the old inventory system, workers had to keep a 
certain amount of raw material in a buffer at all time. Lift trucks 
were used to move parts around, and they created an unsafe 
environment . Using the lean philosophy, these inventories 
are timed to shrink . So instead of having weeks worth of 
screws at the general store, there are . 
Instead of using a lift truck to deliver a pallet of screws to the 
line, someone with a cart delivers a box every two hours.1

y]  Lean/Six Sigma Sys Note the ability of th e operator that  does not need to sort 
through the packa ging to inspect and orient parts is able to 
concentrate on value-added work. Emphasize the impact on inventory turns and the financial 
implications as they relate to cash.  Note the increased focus on 
the cash position of many publicly traded companies. 
The operational and financial impact, along with the low 
cal entrance barriers shou d make parts marketplaces and 
parts presentation improvement an integral component to any 
lean implementation. Concluding comments The most significant barrier to  parts presentation and parts 
marketplace implementation is th e resistance to change of most 
organizations.  The technical re quirements are not intellectually Highlight the visual ability to ea sily assess if parts are missing

Discussion 
 Important issue in manufacturing leadership: 
 Presentation/outsourcing can be carried too far!! 
Can result in loss of key knowledge and long term 
competitive advantage 
Outsourcing is nice for price, and may lead to short-
term economic efficiency, but long term 
cannibalization of competency 
 Parts marketplace important for other parts of 
lean, such as ISPC and value stream mapping, 
etc. 
 It also depends on a PDCA, kaizen process

Discussion for 6.1 
 Standardized work is a core foundation for almost all 
other principles of lean/six sigma 
 One of the big differences between lean and mass: the source of the standardized work 
 Lean: standardized work comes from teams, is constantly 
improved 
 Mass: standardized work imposed by management and 
industrial engineers, very rigid 
 Important goal of standardized work: eliminating 
wasteful motion

Definition 
 Standardized work is A TOOL FOR MAINTAINING 
PRODUCTIVITY, QUALITY, AND SAFETY, at highlevels
1 
 Standardized work is defined as work in which the sequence of job elements has been efficiently organized,and is repeatedly followed by a team member
2 
 Standardized work is a process whose goal is kaizen. If standardized work doesnt change, we are regressing

 Three definitions shed light on different 
aspects of standardized work (SW): 
(1) Illustrates direct bene fits expected from a 
SW implemetation,
(2) Consists of a somewhat direct definition of 
SW,
(3) Expresses the ultimate  potential of  SW, 
continuous improvement
 Contrast SW with Taylorism and industrys 
recent separation of mental and physical labor 
(industrial engineers vs. line workers)
 Point out that the seven benefits listed on slide 
4 are interwoven
 Stress that SW is a beneficial tool by itself but becomes even more powerf ul as part of a lean 
system

 Workers may feel threatened that their jobs are at risk and therefore may not participate fully in optimizing the 
process 
 Standardized work may not show immediate results due to other factors: 
 worker attrition 
 additional training requirement

Types of Maintenance 
 Breakdown Maintenance: 
 Waiting until equipment fails before repairing or servicing it 
 Preventive Maintenance (PM): 
 
cleaning, or replacing parts to prevent sudden failure 
 (Predictive) On-line monitoring of equipment in order to use 
important/expensive parts to the limit of their serviceable life 
 Corrective or Predictive Maintenance: 
 Improving equipment and its components so that preventive 
maintenance can be carried out reliably

The Manufacturing Game 
 Similar to the Beer Game 
 Simulates a typical plant with three roles: 
 Operations Manager 
 Maintenance Manager 
 Spare Parts Stores Manager 
 Each round, participants make decisions such as: 
 Which equipment to take down for PMs 
 How to allocate maintenance resources 
 How many spare parts to order 
 Revenue, cost, output, uptime, inventory are recorded

The Manufacturing Game Results 
 Teams who follow a cost-minimization strategy (reactive 
maintenance policies) are able to keep costs low for a 
uptime falling and costs rising. 
 Teams who follow a preventive maintenance strategy 
initially find higher costs and reduced uptime as 
equipment is taken offline for planned maintenance. Soon, however, these teams begin to greatly outperform teams following a cost-minimization strategy.

Benefits of Preventive Maintenance 
 the cost of breakdown maintenance is usually much 
greater than preventive maintenance. 1 
 Preventive maintenance 
 Keeps equipment in good condition to prevent large problems 
 Extends the useful life of equipment 
 Finds small problems before they become big ones 
 Is an excellent training tool for technicians 
 Helps eliminate rework/scrap and reduces process variability 
 Keeps equipment safer 
 Parts stocking levels can be optimized 
 Greatly reduces unplanned downtime

PM Durations: Why they matter 
 For the exact same availability on a piece of equipment: 
 Shorter PM durations mean a difference in days of lot

Optimizing a PM Schedule 
 Question: 
 If a certain piece of production equipment requires ~10 hours of 
preventive maintenance per week, how should those 10 hours 
be scheduled? 
 Answer: 
 In a 24x7 manufacturing operation, it is typically better to 
perform the ~10 hours of activities in several smaller periods of time, for instance 5 PM activities that take ~2 hours each 
 Duration and variability in preventive maintenance are key 
factors in whether equipment will be able to maintain a steady 
flow of output

Concluding Comments 
 Performing preventive maintenance is almost always the best
long-term strategy to maintain equipment 
 PM scheduling and strategy are keys to maximizing output
while reducing work-in-process inventory 
 Due to short-term cost increases and local optimums, there are
barriers to implementing a preventive maintenance strategy at
some plants

9/04 -- LFM Students]  ESD.60 Lean Six Sigma Systems, LFM, MIT 1. What do you see as the top three ch allenges in transforming an existing 
brownfield plant into a lean production system? 
2. What are the top three strengths and the top three weaknesses in the  
transformation process undertaken in Riverside up to this point? 
3. Do you think this pl ant has passed the point of no return  where it is harder to 
revert back to the old approach than it  is to continue forward with the 
What are the biggest vulnerabilities of the ch ange process, i.e., what events or process 
failures might derail the change effort and start it to revert back to the old approach? 
What would you do to ad dress these vulnerabilities? 
4. What systems changes are required in ot her parts of an ent erprise to support a 
plant that has reached this stage of transformation? 
5. Do you believe that a brownfield plant can end up just as capable in terms of 
lean manufacturing  or even more cap able  than Greenfield plant that was 
designed to be lean from the outset?  Put differ ently, what should our 
expectations for performance be for this plant?

 For example, it would be typical for the Safety Contact Person to put in tickets 
for missing guards on the machines 
 Similarly, it would be typical for the FTPM, Quality, and other Contact Persons 
to be working on those issues 
 Also, some empowered activities take place for reasons other 
than the Coordinator position

A Historical Counterpoint 
astounding. 
9/04 -- LFM Students]  ESD.60 Lean Six Sigma Systems, LFM, MIT This paper has been written: 
First. To point out, through a series of simple illustrat ions, the great loss which the whole country is suffering 
through inefficiency in almost  all of our daily acts. 
Second. To try to convince the reader that the remedy fo r this inefficiency lies in systematic management, 
rather than in searchi ng for some unusual or  extraordinary man. 
Third. To prove that the best management is a true science, resting upon clear ly defined laws , rules, and 
principles, as a foundation. And furt her to show that the fundamental pr inciples of scienti fic management are 
applicable to all kinds of human ac tivities, from our simple st individual acts to  the work of our great 
corporations, which call for the most elaborate coo peration. And, briefly, through a series of illustrations, to 
convince the reader that whene ver these principles are correctly applied, re sults must follow  which are truly 
This paper was originally  prepared for presentation to The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The 
illustrations chosen are su ch as, it is believed, will especially appeal to engi neers and to managers of 
industrial and manufacturi ng establishments, and also quite as much to all of the men who are working in 
these establishments. It is hoped, however, that it will be clear to other readers that  the same principles can 
be applied with equal force to  all social activities: to the managem ent of our homes; the management of our 
farms; the management of th e business of our tradesmen,  large and small;  of our churches , our philanthropic 
institutions, our univ ersities, and our gov ernmental departments.

Deliver value only after iden tifying stakeholder value and 
perspective. 
Address the interdependencies across enterprise levels to 
People, not just processes, effectuate lean value. 
These are very simple statements  think of them as first principles  use these as a constant touch stone

Key Enablers for lean/six sigma front line leadership:
Lean/six sigma knowledge
Career paths that reward success with lean/six sigma
Coaching and mentoring on lean/six sigma from direct 
management and skip-level management
Forums for dialogue and agreement appropriate to lean/six sigma (such as forums for ensuring prompt action on employee 
improvement suggestions)
Important point:  Good leaders can often keep people in 
positionsfiring can may seem easier than coaching 
and helping people to grow, but what are the implications for the system?</text>

Lean implementation strategies
Top-Down  Re-engineering
Many meanings:
Range from a pretext for 
restructuring and downsizing to 
a systematic review of 
operations with comprehensive 
process mapping
Key quote:
if its not broke, break it
Roots:
Roots in private and public sectors, including re-inventing 
government
First driven by economic crisis in 1980s, now seen as a 
process for system change
Archetypical Example:
GE workout process Bottom-up Kaizen
Many meanings:
Range from suggestion systems 
(kaizen-teian) to an underlying 
philosophy and a way of life
Key quote:
many small improvements build   
long-term transformation capability  
Roots:
Post WWII Japan, beginning with 
quality circles (QC), statistical 
process control (SPC), and just-in-
time (JIT) delivery practices
Increasingly seen from a systems perspective -- Total Quality 
Management (TQM), Six Sigma, 
Lean Enterprise
Archetypical Example:
Toyota Production System (TPS)

Key Factors in the Launch  Disconnects
Technical Factors
Length of line too short
Right size racks order, but 
held up and substitutes were wrong size
Cycle time in constraint machine was too long
Kit for parts didnt hold one oversize component
In-line repair area too small
Cleaning time at end of shift used instead for productionSocial Factors
Launch team split up and re-
assigned half way through launch
Turnover among engineers throughout launch
Insufficient training for in-process control
Key Work Group members not released for training
Assumptions about pride in doing a complete job were 
overshadowed by the stress and 
peer pressure
Jealousy between working in repair area and working on line
Work Group Coordinator role was a pinch position  needing more 
preparation and support
Social contract  support to do the job right  overshadowed by high 
schedules</text>

Redefining lean
Definition:
Becoming lean is a process of 
eliminating waste with the goal of 
creating value.
Note:  This stands in contrast to definitions of lean that only 
focus on eliminating waste, which is too often interpreted as 
cost cutting  independent of its impact on value delivery

Productivity here is defined as the number of man-hours required to weld, paint, and 
assemble a vehicle.  These figures hav e been standardized for product size, option 
content, process differences, and actual wo rk schedules (i.e. differing amounts of 
break time).
Quality is based on a J.D. Powers survey of customer-cited defects in the first six months of ownership.  The number in the column are the number of defects per 100 
vehicles.  Only defects attributable to assembly operations are included.
Level of automation is a radio robotic applications in each plant divided by the 
production rate.  These figures have been normalized with 100.0 indicating the highest level of automation in this group.

Reactions/Resistance to Change
Resistance is predictable and understandable
Why do we resist change?
1) Its new and different -- full of uncertainty
2) It feels like its being imposed
3) There are specific parts of the change that I dont like
How do we resist change?
1) Suppressed anger -- Shut down, dont listen, sit there fuming
2) Displaced anger -- Dont get mad, get even
3) Outward anger -- Emotional outburst
What can we do?
1) Ask questions -- learn more about what is involved
2) Look for opportunities -- ar e there aspects of the change th at could help make things 
better?  How many opt ions can we generate?
3) Be clear about specific concerns or issues -- consider who might have 
similar concerns and who might have opposite preferences.  
4) Build agreements that take into account everyones interests</text>

Note:  This chart was on the wall in a work group meeti ng room (the organizations name has been masked).  The reduction 
in variance around 11/13 corresponds to the addition of hourly work group leader s, hourly scrap representatives and 
committeepeople to the daily shift start meeting for the work group.  Also, the Industry and Corporate Benchmarks are both 
in Greenfield Plants with newer presses designed for quick changeover.  The reduct ion in variance and continued 
downward trend line after 11/13 provide a tangible indication of the way social systems can impact production operations.Stamping Plant Hit To Hit Performance in

Front-line Leadership Illustrated (Slide 5 of 5)
Utilizing Front-line Leadership (a real world story, 
concluded):
The morale of the story: CULT URAL CHANGE IS DIFFICULT; YOU 
NEED A GOOD LEADER
When you move into a lean cell structure, you can plan the 80% 
solution and "just do it" or you can plan the 100% solution and you'll 
never change. front-line leadership must be capable of working through the 20% that you couldn't foresee during the planning 
process. This is a much more difficult task for senior leads because 
all the little work rules that developed over the years must be re-
established. When you change the way people work by rolling out a 
lean cell, something as simple as the placement of the coffee pot is a 
really big deal. These are the issues that will stop your initiative -- if 
you have a leader who can resolve them, great. If not, you must 
coach your leader. If your leader can't deal with the ambiguity of an 
80% solution, you must step in.</text>
