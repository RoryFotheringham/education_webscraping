WHAT IS HISTORY?  
 
A. Common definitions  of history 
 
B. The idea of many pasts 
 
C. Ways of studying the past 
e.g. history as past politics 
        social processes/so cial conflicts (cf. Karl Marx) 
        as the story of human progress (cf. Daniel Boorstin) 
        as the story of war (the Civil War) 
 
D. History as an interp retative discipline 
1. E. H. Carr on what constitutes a historical fact 
2. Theories of history: some examples 
a. G. F. Hegel 
b. Karl Marx 
c. F. J. Turner 
d. Lewis Mumford 
e. Thomas Kuhn 
 
E. Lines of interpretation in the history of technology 
1. Technology as the history of e xpanding knowledge/expanding systems 
(example: Thomas P. Hughes) 
2. Technology as a social force (examp le: Lynn Whites stirrup thesis) 
3. Technology as a social product; the social construction of technology 
(example: David Noble; Donald MacKenzie) 
4. Technology as a social process 
(example: Anthony Wallaces Rockdale ) 
 
F. What does all this have to  do with the Civil War? 
It is simply to say that interpretation matters.  The readings and films you will be 
viewing this term present di fferent historical interpreta tions of the Civil War.  I 
want you to pay attention to them and tease out these differences (see last 
assignment re. who got it right?) 
 
In fact, we are going to start out b ackwards so to speak by reading David 
Donalds little about Why the North Won the Civil War , so we can reflect on that 
question as we move through the term a nd all the complexities of the larger 
conflict that we will encounter.  So bear in mind that history is an interpretive, 
open-ended subject.  Quite apart from the war itself, one of the primary objects of</text>
