The spin of proton Ha influences the energy of the two spin states of 
proton Hb.  This "coupling" is transmitted by the electrons in the bonds 
linking Ha and Hb.  The lowest energy state for proton Hb occurs when 
the spins of the two protons are antiparallel.  Note that this effect does 
not require that the molecule be in an external magnetic field.
Key Features of Spin-Spin Splitting
1.  No coupling occurs among chemically (and magnetically) equivalent atoms.
 2.  A nucleus coupled to n equivalent nuclei with spin l is split into 2nl + 1 lines. 3.  Nuclei coupled to each other have the same coupling constant ("J"). 4.  The magnitude of the coupling constant J depends on the dihedral angle and       type of intervening bonds, but is not affected by the strength of the applied field. 5.  "First-order spectra" are obtained only if (va - vb)/Jab &gt; ca. 7 Hz.
 6.  The splitting pattern for nuclei coupled to two or more nonequivalent atoms      can be predicted using "tree diagrams".</text>

Cycloaddition:	A pericyclic reaction in which 2 separate conjugated, overlapping arrays of 
orbitals combine. Cycloadditions proceed by way of a cyclic transition 
state, and 2 sigma bonds are formed during the course of the reaction. 
A suprafacial process ("s" in the table below) is one in which the bonds made or broken lie on 
the same face of the orbital array undergoing reaction. In an antarafacial process ("a"), the 
newly formed or broken bonds lie on opposite faces of the reacting orbital array.

          <text>".in the synthesis of vitamin B-12, R. B. Woodward hit on a puzzle whose analysis become
the point of departure for the discovery of the Woodward-Hoffmann rules concerning the role 
of orbital symmetry in chemical reactions. This development ushered in a new era in the 
theory of organic chemistry, and it is particularly fitting that it was the protagoni st of modern
natural produc t synthesis who triggered the final breakthrough of the use of the quant um
mechanical model of structure and reactivity in organic chemistry, an advance that parallels
the establishment of the classical structural theory, the tetrahedral model of carbon, the octet
rule, and conformational analysis."

Study Guide 
General Aims of this Unit: 
1.	 We will learn to recognize pericyclic reactions and to classify them as being 
electrocyclic processes, cycloadditions, or sigmatropic rearrangements. 
2.	 We will develop a general understanding of the theoretical basis of the Woodward-
Hoffmann Rules based on the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory of Fukui. 
3.	 We will learn how to apply the Woodward-Hoffmann Rules to predict the stereochemical 
outcome of pericyclic reactions. 
4.	 We will study several pericyclic reactions in detail, learning how to predict the products of 
these reactions and how to employ them in synthesis. Specifically, we will focus our 
attention on the Diels-Alder reaction, the Cope rearrangement, the Claisen 
rearrangement, and ketene [2+2] cycloadditions.</text>

          <text>Unit IX. Radicals 
Free Radicals: Friend or Foe? 
Free radicals exist naturally in our bodies and play important roles in many 
essential biochemical processes; however, research has shown that an excess 
of free radicals can trigger destructive chain reactions in cells.  Free radical 
oxidation has been linked to premature aging, high blood pressure, arthritis, 
cancer, and many other ailments.  No wonder Americans spend millions of 
dollars every year on vitamins containing anti-oxidants!  Its even hard to buy 
face cream that doesnt 
claim to fight free 
radicals. From the old 
essentials like b-
carotene and vitamin C, 
to compounds like 
lycopene and EGCg 
that are receiving more 
recent attention, it 
appears that anti-
oxidants are the 
lucrative weapons of 
choice in the endless 
battle against free 
radicals. 
The same highly 
reactive species that 
wreak havoc on our 
bodies have been 
tamed and harnessed 
in the chemistry 
laboratory. Methods have been developed for the selective formation of organic 
radicals under mild conditions, and a great deal of work has focused on 
understanding and predicting the reactivity of free radicals once they are formed. 
Organic radicals have proven to be synthetically useful and mechanistically

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy

13C NMR is useful for: 
1.	Determining the number of chemically non-equivalent (or different types of) carbon 
atoms in a molecule, based on the number of peaks in the spectrum. (See 
substitution test, below.) 
2.	Identifying the types of functional groups in a molecule based on the chemical shift 
of each peak. In contrast to IR spectroscopy, the number of each type of functional 
group (e.g. 2 chemically non-equivalent ketones) often can be determined. 
1H NMR is useful for: 
1.	Determining the number of chemically non-equivalent (or different types of) 
hydrogen atoms in a molecule, based on the number of peaks in the spectrum. Note: 
number of peaks in this case does not include the splitting pattern (see below), e.g. a 
triplet is considered to be one peak. 
2.	Determining the relative number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms by 
measuring the relative area of each peak (by integration of each curve  not by 
measuring the relative peak heights). 
3.	Identifying neighboring functional groups based on the chemical shift of each peak, 
which is a measure of the chemical environment of each proton in the molecule. 
4.	Determining which carbon atoms are connected to which based on the splitting
pattern or multiplicity of each peak. This information is the most useful of all the 
methods we have discussed in determining the connectivity of the molecule, i.e. 
assembling all of the functional groups and fragments identified into an actual structure. 
The substitution test is used to determine whether two atoms or 
groups are chemically non-equivalent: 
1.	Replace each atom or group in turn with X. 
2.	If these two structures are identical (can be superimposed) or are enantiomers, then 
the two atoms or groups are chemically equivalent (homotopic and enantiotopic, 
respectively) and thus are indistinguishable by NMR spectroscopy. 
3.	If the two structures are different (e.g. diastereomers  making the two groups 
diastereotopic, alkene isomers, structural isomers), then the two atoms or groups are 
chemically non-equivalent and may be distinguishable by NMR spectroscopy.</text>

Study Guide 
General Aims of this Unit: 
1.	We will survey three types of spectroscopy and spectrometry: Infrared (IR) 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy (1H and 13C). For each method, we will discuss its physical basis, how 
characteristic data are affected by molecular structure, and the most useful 
applications of these data in structure elucidation. 
2.	We will apply the above methods (and others) to the elucidation of organic molecular 
structures, using a three-stage strategy: Determination of molecular formula, 
identification of functional groups, and elucidation of connectivity. 
(Nearly) Foolproof Protocol for Organic Structure Determination 
A.	Molecular Formula 
1.	Determine molecular formula using elemental analysis (EA) and MS. 
2.	Determine index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD = # rings + # -bonds) from 
molecular formula. 
B.	Functional Groups 
1.	Identify functional groups using IR and 13C NMR (and 1H NMR occasionally) 
2.	Determine symmetry (a.k.a. degeneracy) by comparing 13C NMR to molecular 
formula. 
C.	Connectivity 
1.	Identify molecular fragments using data from 1H NMR: 
a.	spin-spin splitting 
b.	integration 
c.	chemical shift 
d.	and MS fragmentation (can be done earlier in elucidation) 
2.	Assemble fragments 
3.	Confirm structural assignment  Must be consistent with ALL data.</text>

Assignment and Study Guide for Unit I 
Methods for the Elucidation of the Structure of Organic Compounds 
no single tool has had a more dramatic impact upon organic chemistry than infrared 
measurements. The development, just after the second Great War, of sturdy and simply 
operated machines for the determination of infrared spectra has permitted a degree of 
immediate and continuous analytical and structural control in synthetic organic work 
which was literally unimaginable fifteen years ago Physical methods, and the principle 
that they should be used wherever possible, are now part of our armamentarium, and we 
may expect no surcease of further developments in this direction. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance is even now on the horizon, and we shall be surprised if it 
does not permit another great step forward.

Outline &amp; Study Guide for Unit VII. Carbocations 
Every generation of scientific men (i.e. scientists) starts where the previous 
generation left off; and the most advanced discoveries of one age constitute 
elementary axioms of the next. Aldous Huxley 
Carbocationic species are intermediates in many chemical reactions carried out 
in the laboratory, as well as numerous reactions that take place in nature. 
Carbocations are so important, in fact, that Professor George A. 
Olah of The University of Southern California was awarded the 
1994 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contribution to 
carbocation chemistry. 
One famous example of a carbocationic cascade reaction 
is the biosynthesis of cholesterol from squalene oxide. 
Conversion of the linear polyene to the four-ring steroid nucleus 
happens through a series of carbocation rearrangements. 
Elucidation of this extraordinary biosynthetic pathway, one of the most complex 
known, was accomplished by Konrad Bloch, Feodor Lynen, John Cornforth, and 
George Popjak in the late 1950s.  Interestingly, Bloch and Lynen were awarded the 
1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work.  In the course of the next 
few lectures, you will learn how you can harness the power of the carbocation in a 
number of useful synthetic transformations. H3C
