Objective Function
For each fleet - flight combination:  Cost 
Operating cost + Spill cost Recaptured 
revenue
Operating cost associated with assigning a fleet 
type k to a flight leg j is relatively 
straightforward to compute
Can capture range restrictions, noise restrictions, 
water restrictions, etc. by assigning infinite costs
Spill cost for flight leg j and fleet assignment k = 
average revenue per passenger on j * MAX(0, 
unconstrained demand for j number of seats on 
k)
Unclear how to compute reve nue for flight legs, given 
revenue is associated with itineraries
Recaptured revenue
Revenue from passengers that are recaptured back to 
the airline after being spilled from another flight leg</text>

FAM Spi ll Calculation 
Heuristics
Fare Allocation
Full fare - the full fare is assigned to each leg of the 
itinerary
Partial fare - the fare divide d by the number of legs is 
assigned to each leg of the itinerary
Shared fare - the fare di vided by the number of 
capacitated legs is assigned to each capacitated leg in 
the itinerary
Spill Cost for each variable
Representative Fare
A spill fare is calculated; each passenger spilled results in a loss of 
revenue equal to the spill fare
Integration
Sort each itinerary by fare, spill costs are sum of xlowest fare 
passengers, where x = max{0, demand - capacity}</text>

Assignment
Impossible to estimate airline profit 
exactly using link-based costs
Enhance basic fleet assignment model 
to include passenger flow decision 
variables

Spill Calculation:  Results
For a 3 fleet, 226 flights problem:
The best representative fare solution results in 
a gap with the optimal solution of $2,600/day
Using a shared fare scheme and integration 
approach, we found a solution with an $8/day 
gap.
By simply modifying the basic spill model, 
significant gains can be achieved</text>

Resulting schedules operate fewer flights
Lower operating costs
Fewer aircraft required

A few observations on FAM:
Nodes can be consolidated to reduce model 
size;
Fleet-specific time-line networks are possible;
Fleet assignment not aircraft assignment! 
Note that feasibility of FAM implies that 
aircraft rotations exist (takes only a little bit 
of thinking);
However, these rotations might not be 
maintenance feasible</text>

          <text>2. Frequency Planning
Frequency of departures on a route improves 
convenience of air travel for passengers and 
increases market share:
Peak departure times (early morning and late afternoon) are most
attractive to a larger proportion of travelers in many markets
More frequent departures further reduce schedule displacement or
wait time between flights, reducing travel inconvenience
Frequency is much more important in short-haul markets than for 
long-haul routes where actual flight time dominates wait time
In competitive markets, airline frequency share is most important to 
capturing time sensitive business travelers
Frequency of departures can be as important as path quality (non-
stop vs. connection) in many cases</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>9</slideno>
          <text>Timetable Development Constraints
Most airlines choose to maximize aircraft utilization:
Keep ground turn-around times to a minimum
Fly even off-peak flights to maintain frequency share and to 
position aircraft for peak flights at other cities
Leaves little buffer time for maintenance and weather delays
Numerous constraints affect timetable development:
Hub networks require that flights arrive from spoke cities within a 
prescribed time range, to facilitate passenger connections
Time zone differences limit feasible departure times (e.g., flights 
from US to Europe do not depart before 1700, as passengers do not 
want to arrive at their destination before 0600)
Airport slot times, noise curfews limit scheduling flexibility
Crew scheduling and routine maintenance requirements also affect
timetable development</text>

Potential for additional traffic from connecting flights
Load consolidation affects frequency and aircraft 
size decisions:
Single flight with multiple stops provides service to several origin-
destination markets at the same time
Allows airline to operate higher frequency and/or larger aircraft
A fundamental reason for economic success of airline hubs</text>

          <text>Timetable Development Process
Complexity and size of timetable development 
problem make most schedule changes incremental:
A single change in departure time of a flight from A can have major 
impacts on down-line times, connections, aircraft rotations, and 
even number of aircraft required to operate the schedule
Further complicated by crew and maintenance schedule needs, 
requiring coordination with several airline operational departments
There are no computer models that can determine optimal
timetable, given huge combination of departure/arrival times, 
demand and market share estimates, and thousands of constraints
However, interactive computer scheduling databases and decision 
support tools allow for much faster what-if analysis
Substantial decision support progress in fleet assignment and 
aircraft rotation optimization</text>

          <text>3. Timetable Development
For a chosen frequency of service on each route, next step 
is to develop a specific time table of flight departures:
Goal is to provide departures at peak periods (0900 and 1700)
But, not all departures can be at peak periods on all possible 
routes, given aircraft fleet and rotation considerations
Minimum turn-around times required at each stop to 
deplane/enplane passengers, re-fuel and clean aircraft
For example, 0900 departure from city A with 1100 arrival at 
B results in possible departure of aircraft from B at 1200
If this aircraft is to return to A, 1200 departure will be off-peak 
and have potentially lower dema nd, but keeping the aircraft 
on the ground until the next peak period reduces aircraft 
utilization (block hours per day)</text>

          <text>1. Schedule Development Process
Given a set of routes to be operated in an airline 
network, and a fleet of aircraft, schedule development 
involves
Frequency planning (how often?)
Timetable development (at what times?)
Fleet assignment (what type of aircraft?)
Aircraft rotation planning (network balance)
The process begins a year or more in advance and 
continues until actual departure time:
Frequency plans established first, based on routes and aircraft
Timetables and aircraft rotations defined 2-6 months in advance
Final revisions and irregular operations until the flight departs</text>

Voluntary vs. Involuntary DBs
Comprehensive Voluntary DB Program:
Requires training and cooperation of station crews
Identify potential volunteers at check-in
Offer as much soft compensation as needed to make the 
passenger happy
US airlines very successful in managing DBs:
2004 involuntary DB rate was 0.62 per 10,000
95% of DBs in U.S. are volunteers
Good treatment of volunteers generates goodwill</text>

Background:  Flight Overbooking
Determine maximum number of bookings to accept 
for a given physical capacity.
Minimize total costs of denied boardings and spoilage
(lost revenue).
U.S. domestic no-show rates can reach 15-20 percent 
of final pre-departure bookings:
On peak holiday days, when high no-shows are least desirable
Average no-show rates have dropped, to 10-15% with more fare 
penalties and better efforts by airlines to firm up bookings
Effective overbooking can generate as much revenue 
gain as fare class seat allocation.</text>

Probabilistic Model Extensions
1.  Reduce level of confidence of exceeding DB limit:
Z factor in denominator will decrease, causing increase in AU
2.  Increase DB tolerance to account for voluntary DB:
Numerator becomes (CAP+ VOLDB), increases AU
3.  Include forecasted empty F or C cabin seats for 
upgrading:
Numerator becomes (CAP+FEMPTY+CEMPTY), increases AU
Empty F+C could also be overbooked
4.  Deduct group bookings and overbook remaining 
capacity only:
Firm groups much more likely to show up
Flights with firm groups should have lower AU</text>

3. Probabilistic/Risk Model
Incorporates uncertainty a bout NSR for future flight:
Standard deviation of NSR from history, STD
Find AU that will keep DB=0, assuming BKD=AU, with a 95% 
level of confidence:
Assume a probability (Gaussian) distribution of no-show rates
Keep show-ups less than or  equal to CAP, when BKD =AU:
Find SUR*, so t hat AU x SUR* = CA P, and Prob[AU x SUR* &gt; CAP] = 5%
From Gaussian distribution, SUR* will satisfy: 
Z = 1.645 =   SUR* - SUR
STD
where SUR = mean show-up rate
STD = standard deviation of show-up rate</text>

  ICATMIT    ICAT
Probabilistic/Risk Model (contd )
Optimal AU given CAP, SUR, STD with objective of 
DB=0 with 95% confidence is:
AU = CAP            =       CAP              . 
SUR + 1.645 STD 1-NSR + 1.645 STD
In our example, with STD= 0.05:
AU = 100 / (1-0.20 + 1.645*0.05) = 113
The larger STD, the larger the denominator and the 
lower the optimal AU, due to increased 
risk/uncertainty about no-shows.</text>

4. Cost-Based Overbooking Model
Find AU that minimizes :
[Cost of DB + Cost of SP]
For any given AU:
Total Cost =  $DB * E[DB] + $SP * E[SP]
$DB and $SP= cost per DB and SP, respectively
E[DB] = expected number of DBs, given AU
E[SP] = expected number of SP seats, given AU
Mathematical search over range of AU values to find 
minimum total cost.</text>

Customer Service and Goodwill
Many airlines tend to view aggressive overbooking in 
negative terms:
Denied boardings associated with poor customer service and loss 
of passenger goodwill
But revenue loss of spoiled seats can be greater than 
DB costs:
Objective is to reduce both actual costs and loss of goodwill due to 
denied boardings

Cost Inputs (contd)
Spoilage Costs:
Loss of revenue from seat that departed empty
What is best measure of this lost revenue:
Average revenue per seat for leg?
Highest fare class revenue on leg (since closed flights lose late-
booking passengers)?
Lowest fare class revenue on leg (since increased AU would have 
allowed another discount seat)?
Specifying spoilage costs is just as difficult.</text>

1. Manual/Judgmental Approach
Relies on judgment of human analyst to set 
overbooking level:
Based on market experience and perhaps recent no-show history
Tendency to choose OV = 1+NSR (or lower)
Tendency to focus on avoidance of DB
For CAP=100 and  mean NSR=.20, then:
AU = 100 (1.20) = 120</text>

2. Deterministic Model
Based on estimate of mean NSR from recent history:
Assume that BKD= AU (worst case scenario)
Find AU such that AU - NSR*AU = CAP
Or,  A U = CAP/(1-NSR)
For CAP=100 and NSR=0.20, then:
AU = 100/(1-.20) = 125</text>

Overbooking Relationships
1.  PAX = min [ BKD - NS + GS + SB, CAP]
= BKD + GS - NS + SB - DB
2.  BKD = NS + SU
3.  SU = PAX + DB - GS -SB
4.  NSR = (BKD  - SU) / BKD
5.  SUR = SU / BKD = 1.0 - NSR
6.  SP = CAP - PAX,  only when BKD = AU</text>

Total costs of overbooking (denied boardings plus spoilage)
Risk of excessive denied boardings on individual flights, for

Existing Airline RM Systems Need to be 
Modified for This New Environment 
yRM systems were developed for restricted fares
Assumed independent fare clas s demands, because restrictions 
kept full-fare passengers from buying lower fares
With unrestricted fares, passeng ers buy lowest available fare
yWithout modification, these RM systems do not 
perform well in less restricted fare structures
Unless demand forecasts are adjusted to reflect potential sell-up, 
high-fare demand will be consis tently under-forecast
Optimizer then under-protects, allowing more spiral down
yRM system limitations are affecting airline revenues
Existing systems, left unadjusted,  generate high load factors but 
do not maximize revenues
Many airlines are currently using manual overrides</text>

Steps Toward Fare Simplification
yFrom fully restricted BASE, simulate impacts of 
simplified restrictions and/or AP rules (separately):
Remove Advance Purchase Rules (o nly)
Remove Saturday Night Min Stay restriction (only)
Remove ALL restrictions but keep AP Rules
Remove ALL restrictions and AP Rules 
yAssess impacts of each simplification on:
Total flight revenues
Fare class mix
Revenue gain performance of Leg-Based RM (EMSRb)
yWhen does spiral down make traditional Leg RM 
controls ineffective?</text>

Fare Simplification:
Less Restricted and Lower Fares
yRecent trend toward simplified fares  compressed 
fare structures with fewer restrictions
Initiated by some LFAs and Amer ica West, followed by Alaska 
Most recently, implemented in all US domestic markets by Delta, 
matched selectively by legacy competitors
ySimplified fare structures characterized by:
No Saturday night stay restri ctions, but advance purchase and 
non-refundable/change fees
Lower fare ratios from highest to lowest available fares, typ ically 
no higher than 4:1 in affe cted US domestic markets
Revenue management systems still control number of seats sold 
at each fare level</text>

Competitive Impacts of O-D Methods
Implementation of O-D control can have negative 
revenue impacts on competitor:
4Continued use of basic FCYM  by Airline B against O-D 
methods used by Airline A results in revenue losses for B
4Not strictly a zero-sum game, as revenue gains of Airline A 
exceed revenue losses of Airline B
4Other PODS simulation result s show both airlines can 
benefit from using more sophisticated O-D control
Failure to implement network RM (O-D control) can 
actually lead to revenue losses against competitor!</text>

Alliance Network O-D Control
Alliance code-sharing affect revenue gains of O-D 
control
4Ability to distinguish between ODIF requests with different 
network revenue values can giv e O-D control airline a 
revenue advantage
4With separate and uncoordi nated RM, one partner can 
benefit more than the other, even causing other partners 
revenues to decrease
Information sharing improves network revenue 
gains, even if partners use different O-D methods:
4Exchanges of network displacement costs or bid prices

Abuse of O-D Controls
GDS and website technology has evolved to provide 
improved fare searches:
4Objective is to consistently del iver lowest possible fare to 
passengers and/or travel agent s in a complic ated and 
competitive pricing env ironment
Example: Booking two local legs when connecting 
itinerary not available, then pricing at the through 
O-D fare in the same booking class.
4Appears to be occurring more  frequently, as web site and

Revenue Impacts of O-D Abuse
How big is the revenue impact on O-D methods?
4No revenue impact on FCYM control, sinc e no distinction 
between loc al and connecting requests
Impact depends proportion of eligible booking 
requests that actually commit abuse
4Even at 25% probability of abuse, revenue gains of DAVN 
are reduced by up to 1/3
4Means  actual revenue gain of DAVN  is closer to 1.0% than

4Revenue gains almost double vs. FCYM base case
4Forecasting model can have as great an impact as choice of 
optimization model
Possible explanations for improved gains
4ODF Forecasts are not more accurate-- inability to 
accurately measure actual demand
4Overall forecasts are now larger due to more aggres sive

Response to Low-Fare Competition
Under basic leg/fare class RM, no control over value 
of different passengers booking in each class
4With low-fare competitor, matching fares requires 
assignment to specific fare class
4Fare class shared by all O-D itin eraries  using same flight leg 
and supply of seats
With O-D control, bookings are limited by network 
revenue value, not fare type or restrictions
4Low matching fares will stil l be available on empty flights
4But will not displace higher revenue network passengers</text>

4By as much as 8-9% with removal of advanc e purchase
4By 13% or more with no Sat. night stay requirements
Revenue loss is mitigated by O&amp;D control methods
4Compared to less sophis ticated FCYM practices

Price Elasticity of Demand
Definition: Percent change in total demand that 
occurs with a 1% increase in average price charged.
Price elasticity of demand  is always negative :
A 10% price increase will cause an X% demand decrease , all else 
being equal (e.g., no change to frequency or market variables)
Business air travel demand is slightly inelastic (0 &gt; Ep&gt; -1.0)
Leisure demand for air travel is much more elastic (Ep&lt; -1.0)
Empirical studies have shown typical range of airline market price 
elasticities from -0.8 to -2.0 (air travel demand tends to be elastic)
Elasticity of demand in specific O-D markets will depend on mix of 
business and leisure travel</text>

1. Basic Airline Profit Model
Operating Profit = Revenues - Operating Expense
Operating Profit = RPM x Yield - ASM x Unit Cost
The use of individual terms in this profit equation to 
measure airline success can be misleading:
High Yield is not desirable if ALF is too low; in general, Yield is a 
poor indicator of airline profitability
Low Unit Cost is of little value if Revenues are weak
Even ALF on its own tells us little about profitability, as high ALF 
could be the result of extremely low fares (yields)
Airline profit maximizing strategy is to increase 
revenues, decrease costs, but the above terms are 
interrelated.</text>

Less Restricted and Lower Fares
Recent trend toward simplified fares  compressed

Initiated by some LFAs and America West, followed by Alaska 
Most recently, implemented in all US domestic markets by Delta, 
matched selectively by legacy competitors
Simplified fare structures characterized by:
No Saturday night stay restrictions, but advance purchase and non-
refundable/change fees
Revenue management systems still control number of seats sold at
each fare level
Higher load factors, but 10-15% lower revenues:

4. Airline Competition
Airlines compete for passengers and market share 
based on:
Frequency of service and departure schedule on each route served
Price charged, relative to other airlines, to the extent that regulation 
allows for price competition
Quality of service and products offered -- airport and in-flight 
service amenities and/or restri ctions on discount fare products
Passengers choose combination of flight schedules, 
prices and product quality that minimizes disutility of 
air travel:
Each passenger would like to have the best service on a flight that 
departs at the most convenient time, for the lowest price</text>

3.  Demand Models
Demand models are mathematical representations of 
the relationship between demand and explanatory 
variables:
Based on our assumptions of what affects air travel demand
Can be linear (additive) models or non-linear (multiplicative)
Model specification reflects expectations of demand behavior (e.g., 
when prices rise, demand should decrease)
A properly estimated demand model allows airlines to 
more accurately forecast demand in an O-D market:
As a function of changes in average fares
Given recent or planned changes to frequency of service
To account for changes in market or economic conditions</text>

Airline Pricing Practices
Differential pricing present s a trade-off to customers 
between inconvenience and price levels:
Business travelers are willing to pay higher fares in return for more 
convenience, fewer restrictions on use of tickets
Leisure travelers less willing to pay higher prices, but accept 
disutility costs of restrictions on low fare products
Economic concept of willingness to pay (WTP) is 
defined by the theoretical price-demand curve:
Willingness does not mean happiness in paying higher prices
Differential pricing attempts to make those with higher WTP purchase 
the less restricted higher-priced options</text>

 Price Discrimination vs. Product 
Differentiation
Price discrimination:
The practice of charging different prices for same product with 
same costs of production
Based solely on different consumers willingness to pay
Product differentiation:
Charging different prices for products with different characteristics 
and costs of production
Current airline fare structures reflect both strategies:
Differential Pr icing based on differentiated fare products
But higher prices for fare products targeted at business travelers 
are clearly based on their willingness to pay</text>

Theoretical Pricing Strategies
For determining prices to charge in an O-D market, 
airlines can utilize one of following economic 
principles:
Cost-based pricing
Demand-based pricing
Service-based pricing
In practice, most airline pricing strategies reflect a 
mix of these theoretical principles:
Prices are also highly affected by competition in each O-D market
In the US, severe competition in some markets has led to price-
based costing, meaning airlines must reduce costs to be able to 
match low-fare competitors and passengers price expectations</text>

Simple Market Demand Function
Multiplicative model of demand for travel O-D per 
period:
D = M x Pax Tb
where: M = market sizing parameter (constant) that represents 
underlying population and interaction between cities
P = average price of air travel
T = total trip time, reflecting changes in frequency
a,b = price and time elasticities of demand
We can estimate values of M, a, and b from historical 
data sample of D, P, and  T for same market:

Why Differential Pricing?
It allows the airline to increase total flight revenues 
with little impact on total operating costs:
Incremental revenue generated by discount fare passengers who 
otherwise would not fly
Incremental revenue from high fare passengers willing to pay more
Studies have shown that most traditional high-cost airlines could 
not cover total operating costs by offering a single fare level
Consumers can also benefit from differential pricing:
Most notably, discount passengers who otherwise would not fly
It is also conceivable that high fare passengers pay less and/or
enjoy more frequency given the presence of low fare passengers</text>

Market Share / Frequency Share
Rule of Thumb :  With all else equal, airline market 
shares will approximately equal their frequency 
shares.
But there is much empirical evidence of an S-curve
relationship as shown on the following slide:
Higher frequency shares are associated with disproportionately 
higher market shares
An airline with more frequency captures all passengers wishing to 
fly during periods when only it offers a flight, and shares the 
demand wishing to depart at times when both airlines offer flights
Thus, there is a tendency for competing airlines to match flight 
frequencies in many non-stop markets, to retain market share</text>

Time Elasticity of Demand
Definition:  Percent change in total O-D demand that 
occurs with a 1% increase in total trip time.
Time elasticity of demand  is also negative:
A 10% increase in total trip time will cause an X% demand decrease , 
all else being equal (e.g., no change in prices)
Business air travel demand is more time elastic (Et &lt; -1.0), as 
demand can be stimulated by improving travel convenience
Leisure demand is time inelastic (Et &gt; -1.0), as price sensitive 
vacationers are willing to endure less convenient flight times
Empirical studies show narrower range of airline market time 
elasticities from -0.8 to -1.6, affected by existing frequency</text>

5.  Airline Prices and O-D Markets
Like air travel demand, airline fares are defined for an 
O-D market, not for an an airline flight leg:
Airline prices for travel A-B depend on O-D market demand, supply 
and competitive characteristics in that market
No economic theoretical reason for prices in market A-B to be 
related to prices A-C, based strictly on distance traveled
Could be that price A-C is actually lower than price A-B 
These are different markets with different demand characteristics, 
which might just happen to share joint supply on a flight leg
Dichotomy of airline demand and supply makes 
finding an equilibrium between prices and distances 
more difficult.</text>

Total Trip Time from Point A to B
Next to price of air travel, most important factor 
affecting demand for airline services:
Access and egress times to/from ai rports at origin and destination
Pre-departure and post-arrival processing times at each airport
Actual flight times plus connecting times between flights
Schedule displacement or wait times due to inadequate frequency
Total trip time captures impacts of flight frequency, 
path quality relative to other carriers, other modes.
Reduction in total trip time should lead to increase in total air travel 
demand in O-D market
Increased frequency and non-stop flights reduce total trip time
Increases in total trip time will l ead to reduced demand for air travel, 
either to alternative modes or the no travel option</text>

pay for air travel

 Traditional Approach: Restrictions on 
Lower Fares
Progressively more severe restrictions on low fare 
products designed to prevent diversion:
Lowest fares have advance purchase and minimum stay 
requirements , as well as cancellation and change fees  
Restrictions increase the inconvenience or disutility cost of low 
fares to travelers with high WTP, forcing them to pay more
Studies show Saturday night minimum stay condition to be most 
effective in keeping business travelers from purchasing low fares
Still, it is impossible to achieve perfect segmentation:
Some travelers with high WTP can meet restrictions
Many business travelers often purchase restricted fares</text>

Implications for Analysis
Dichotomy of airline demand and supply complicates 
many facets of airline economic analysis
Difficult, in theory, to answer seemingly simple
economic questions, for example:
Because we cannot quantify supply to an individual O-D market, 
we cannot determine if the market is in equilibrium
Cannot determine if the airlines service to that O-D market is 
profitable, or whether fares are too high or too low
Serious difficulties in proving predatory pricing against low-fare 
new entrants, given joint supply of  seats to multiple O-D markets 
and inability to isolate costs of serving each O-D market
In practice, assumptions about cost and revenue 
allocation are required:
Estimates of flight and/or route profitability are open to question</text>

  ICATMIT    ICAT
Dichotomy of Demand and Supply
Inherent inability to directly compare demand and 
supply at the market level
Demand is generated by O-D market, while supply is 
provided as a set of flight leg departures over a 
network of operations
One flight leg provides joint supply of seats to many 
O-D markets
Number of seats on the flight is not the supply to a single market
Not possible (or realistic) to determine supply of seats to each O-D
Single O-D market served by many competing airline 
paths
Tabulation of total O-D market traffic requires detailed ticket coupon 
analysis</text>

Implications for Airline Pricing
Inelastic (-0.8) business demand for air travel means 
less sensitivity to price changes:
10% price increase leads to only 8% demand reduction
Total airline revenues increase, despite price increase
Elastic (-1.6) leisure demand for air travel means 
greater sensitivity to price changes
10% price increase causes a 16% demand decrease
Total revenues decrease given price increase, and vice versa
Recent airline pricing practices are explained by price 
elasticities:
Increase fares for inelastic business travelers to increase revenues
Decrease fares for elastic leisur e travelers to increase revenues</text>

Longer average stage lengths associated with lower yields and 
lower unit costs (in theory)
Average Passenger Trip Length
Average distance flown from origin to destination
Revenue Passenger Miles (RPMS) / Passengers
Typically greater than average stage length, since some proportion 
of passengers will take more than one flight (connections)

Origin-Destination Market Demand
Air travel demand is defined for an origin-destination 
market , not a flight leg in an airline network:
Number of persons wishing to travel from origin A to destination B 
during a given time period (e.g., per day)
Includes both passengers starting their trip at A and those 
completing their travel by returning home to B (opposite markets)
Typically, volume of travel measured in one-way passenger trips 
between A and B, perhaps summed over both directions
Airline networks create complications for analysis of 
market demand and supply: 
Not all A-B passengers will fly on non-stop flights from A to B, as 
some will choose one-stop or connecting paths
Any single non-stop flight leg A-B can also serves many other O-D 
markets, as part of connecting or multi-stop paths</text>

Implications of Time Elasticity
Business demand responds more than leisure 
demand to reductions in total travel time:
Increased frequency of departures is most important way for an 
airline to reduce total travel time in the short run
Reduced flight times can also have an impact  (e.g., using jet vs. 
propeller aircraft)
More non-stop vs. connecting flights will also reduce T
Leisure demand not nearly as time sensitive:
Frequency and path quality not as important as price
But there exists a saturation frequency in each 
market:
Point at which additional frequency does not increase demand</text>

Total Trip Time and Frequency
T = t(fixed) + t(flight) + t(schedule displacement)
Fixed time elements include access and egress, airport processing
Flight time includes aircraft block times plus connecting times
Schedule displacement = (K hours / frequency), meaning it 
decreases with increases in frequency of departures
This model is useful in explaining why:
Non-stop flights are preferred to connections (lower flight times)
More frequent service increases travel demand (lower schedule 
displacement times)
Frequency is more important in short-haul markets (schedule 
displacement is a much larger proportion of total T)
Many connecting departures through a hub might be better than 1 
non-stop per day (lower total T for the average passenger)</text>

Dynamic Revision and Intervention
RM systems revise forecasts and re-optimize booking 
limits at numerous checkpoints of the booking 
process:
Monitor actual bookings vs. previously forecasted demand 
Re-forecast demand and re-optimize at fixed checkpoints or when 
unexpected booking activity occurs
Can mean substantial changes in fare class availability from one
day to the next, even for the same flight departure
Substantial proportion of fare mix revenue gain 
comes from dynamic revision of booking limits:
Human intervention is important in unusual circumstances, such as 
unexplained surges in demand due to special events</text>

EMSRb Model Calculations
Because higher classes have  access to unused lower 
class seats, the problem is to find seat protection 
levels for higher classes, and booking limits on lower 
classes
To calculate the optimal protection levels:
Define Pi(Si) = probability that Xi&gt;Si,   
where Siis the number of seats made available to class i, Xiis the 
random demand for class i</text>

ePODS replicates airline RM system actions over time,

Previously applied booking limits affect actual passenger loads and, 
in turn, future demand forecasts
Historical booking data is used to generate forecasts

Why Call it Yield Management?
Main objective of YM is to protect seats for later-
booking, high-fare business passengers.
YM involves tactical control of airlines seat inventory:
But too much emphasis on yield (revenue per RPM) can lead to 
overly severe limits on low fares, and lower overall load factors
Too m any seats sold at lower fares will increase load factors but 
reduce yield, adversely affective total revenues
Revenue maximization is proper goal: 
Requires proper balance of load factor and yield
Many airlines now refer to Revenue Management
(RM) instead of Yield Management</text>

Probability Calculations
Next, we use Excel or go to the Standard Normal 
Cumulative Probability Table for different guesses
for Y.  For example, 
for Y = 7, Pro b { (XY -10)/3 &gt; (77-10)/3 } = 0.841
for Y = 8, Pro b { (XY -10)/3 &gt; (88-10)/3 } = 0.747
for Y = 9, Pro b { (XY -10)/3 &gt; (99-10)/3 } = 0.63
So, we can see that Y = 8 is the largest integer value 
of Y that gives a probability &gt; 0.7 and therefore we will 
protect 8 seats for Y class!</text>

Deterministic Seat Allocation/Protection
If we assume that demand is deterministic (or known 
with certainty ), it would be simple to determine the 
fare class seat allocations
Start with highest fare class and allocate/protect exactly the number 
of seats predicted for that class, and continue with the next lower 
fare class until capacity is reached.
EXAMPLE :  3 fare classes (Y, B, M)
Demand for Y = 30, B = 40, M = 85
Capacity = 140

Protection for Y+B Classes
To find the protection for the Y and B fare classes 
from M, we want to find the largest value of YB that 
makes

Example:  Joint Protection
The protection level for Y+B classes satisfies:
820 * PYB(YB ) &gt;500
PYB(YB ) &gt;.6098
Again, we can make different guesses for YB.
for YB = 20, Prob { (XYB -25)/5.83 &gt; (2020-25)/5.83 } = 0.805
for YB = 22, Prob { (XYB -25)/5.83 &gt; (2222-25)/5.83 } = 0.697
for YB = 23,Prob { (XYB -25)/5.83 &gt; (2323-25)/5.83 } = 0.633

Typical 3rd Generation RM System
Collects and maintains historical booking data by 
flight and fare class, for each past departure date.
Forecasts future booking demand and no-show rates 
by flight departure date and fare class.
Calculates limits to maximize total flight revenues:
Overbooking levels to minimize costs of spoilage/denied boardings
Booking class limits on low-value classes to protect high-fare seats

2. Computerized RM Systems
Size and complexity of a typical airlines seat 
inventory control problem requires a computerized 
RM system
Consider a US Major airline with:
2000 flight legs per day
10 booking classes
300 days of bookings before departure
At any point in time, this airlines seat inventory 
consists of 6 million booking limits:
This inventory represents the airlines potential for profitable 
operation, depending on the revenues obtained
Far too large a problem for human analysts to monitor alone</text>

EMSRb Calculations (contd)
The expected marginal revenue of making the Sth 
seat available to class i is:
EMSRi(Si ) = Ri* Pi(Si )  where Ri  is the average revenue (or fare) from 
class i
The optimal protection level, 1for class 1 from class 
2 satisfies:
EMSR1(1) = R1* P1(1 ) = R2  
Once 1 is found, set BL2= Capacity - 1.Of course, 
BL1= Capacity (authorized capacity if overbooking)</text>

Joint Protection for Y+B
So, we can see that YB = 23 is the largest integer 
value of YB that gives a probability &gt; 0.6098 and 
therefore we will jointly protect 23 seats for Y and B 
class from class M!
Suppose we had an aircraft with authorized booking 
capacity 80 seats, our Booking Limits would be: 
BLY = 80
BLB = 80 - 8 = 72
BLM = 80 - 23 = 57</text>

Partitioned vs. Serial Nesting
In a partitioned CRS inventory structure, allocations 
to each booking class are made separately from all 
the other classes.
EXAMPLE (assuming uncertain demand):
Given the following allocations for each of 3 classes--Y = 30,  B = 
40, M = 70 for an aircraft coach cabin with booking capacity = 140.
If 31 Y customers request a seat, the airline would reject the 31st
request because it exceeds the allocation for the Y class
It is possible that airline would reject the 31st Y class customer, 
even though it might not have sold a ll of the (lower-valued) B or M 
seats yet!  
Under serial nesting of booking classes, the airline 
would never turn down a Y fare request, as long as 
there are any seats (Y, B or M) left for sale.</text>

 EMSRb Model for Seat Protection:
Assumptions
Basic modeling assumptions for serially nested 
classes:
a) demand for each class is separate and independent of demand in 
other classes.
b) demand for each class is stochastic and can be represented by a 
probability distribution
c) lowest class books first, in its entirety, followed by the next lowest 
class, etc.
d) booking limits are only determined once (i.e., static optimization 
model)</text>

1. Airline Revenue Maximization
Two components of airline revenue maximization:
Differential Pricing:
Various fare products offered at different prices for travel in the 
same O-D market
Yield Management (YM):
Determines the number of seats to be made available to each fare 
class on a flight, by setting bo oking limits on low fare seats
Typically, YM takes a set of differentiated 
prices/products and flight capacity as given:
With high proportion of fixed ope rating costs for a committed flight 
schedule, revenue maximization to maximize profits</text>

PY(Y ) &gt;0.70
where PY (Y ) = probability that XY&gt;Y.
If we assume demand in Y class is normally
distributed with mean, standard deviation given 
earlier, then we can create a standardized normal 
random variable as (XY -10)/3.</text>

Current State of RM Practice
Most of the top 25 world airlines (in terms of revenue) 
have implemented 3rd generation RM systems. 
Many smaller carriers are still trying to make effective 
use of leg/fare class RM
Lack of company-wide understanding of RM principles
Historical emphasis on load factor or yield, not revenue
Excessive influence and/or RM abuse by dominant sales and 
marketing departments
Issues of regulation, organization and culture
About a dozen leading airlines are looking toward 
network O-D control development and implementation
These carriers could achieve a 2-5 year competitive advantage with 
advanced revenue management systems</text>

Under Fare Simplification
ySimplified fare structures characterized by
One-way fares with little or no product differentiation, priced at 
different fare levels 
Existing RM systems employed to control number of seats sold at 
each fare level
yBut RM systems were developed for restricted fares
Assumed independent fare clas s demands, because restrictions 
kept full-fare passengers from buying lower fares
Time series forecasting models used to predict future demand 
based on historical book ings in each fare class
Given independent demand foreca sts, top-down protection for 
highest classes, extra seats m ade available to lowes t class</text>

Distorted Forecasts Affect RM Performance
ySpiral-down leads to high forecasts in lower classes
And, in turn, forecasts that are too low  in higher classes
yIn EMSR-based leg RM, at least the lowest class 
demand is rejected when demand is high
Not revenue maximiz ing, but some benefit from booking limits
yRecent PODS simulations illustrate impacts of 
distorted forecasts on O+D method performance:
Mismatch between independent path/class demands  assumed by 
network optimizer and reality of passenger sell-up
Network optimizers over-protect for forecast low-class connecting 
traffic, leading to distorted bi d prices or dis placement costs</text>

Existing RM Forecasts Are Inadequate for

yExisting RM systems need to be modified
Mismatch between RM model assu mptions and fare structures
yPrice/product hybrid forecasting increases revenues
Compared to use of standard RM forecasting methods
Gains come from higher forecasts in upper/middle classes, 
increasing protection and help ing to reduce spiral down
yModified forecasters require estimates of passenger 
WTP by time to departure for each flight
Approach is to forecast maxi mum demand potential at lowest 
fare, and convert into partitio ned forecasts for each fare class
yBut, WTP forecasting is much more difficult</text>

Factors Affecting WTP Estimates
yTime to departure
Business travelers with higher WTP book closer to departure date
yPeak vs. off-peak periods
Higher demand periods te nd to have higher WTP
yMarket characteristics
Limited competition and low capac ity (relative to demand) means 
a higher WTP among consumers
yRM seat availability  your own and your competitors
Weak RM controls on previous fl ights mean historical bookings  
dont reflect higher WTP of consumers
High availability of low-fare seat s on competitor makes it difficult

Existing Airline RM Systems Need to be 
Modified for Changing Fare Structures 
yWithout modification, these RM systems will not 
maximize revenues in less restricted fare structures
Unless demand forecasts are adjusted to reflect potential sell-up, 
high-fare demand will be consis tently under-forecast
Optimizer then under-protects, allowing more spiral down
yCurrent RM system limitations are negatively 
affecting airline revenues
Existing systems, left unadjusted,  generate high load factors but 
do not increase yields
Many legacy carriers are using rule-based RM practices
yRM forecasting models must be changed to reflect 
passenger willingness to pay (WTP)</text>

Forecasting by Willingness to Pay
yWith undifferentiated fares, forecasting must focus 
on demand by willingness to pay higher fares
Approach is to transform all hist orical book ings at different fares 
to maximum demand potential at lowest fare
yTotal demand potential at lowest fare converted to 
demand forecasts by fare level for future flights
Based on estimates of sell-up potential/WTP
yBut, most simplified fare structures still retain some 
product differentiation

Hybrid Forecasting For Partially 
Differentiated Fare Structures
Generate separate forecasts for price (priceable) 
and product (yieldable) oriented demand
A passenger is price-oriented if the next lower class from the one 
booked is closed
A passenger is product-oriented if the next lower class from the 
one booked was open.
Combine standard forecasts and WTP forecasts for 
input to RM optimizers
For product-oriented demand, bookings are treated as a historical 
data for the given class, and standard time series forecasting 
applied.
For price-oriented demand, forecasts by WTP based on expected 
sell-up behavior</text>

Fare Class Restriction Disutilities
Disutility costs associated with the restrictions of each 
fare class are added to the fare value to determine the 
choice sequence of a given passenger among the 
classes with fare values less than his/her WTP. 
The restrictions are:
4R1: Saturday night stay (for M, B and Q classes),
4R2: cancellation/change pe nalty (for B and Q classes),
4R3: non-refundability (for Q class).</text>

          <text>Route Planning and Evaluation
Given a fleet plan, the process of route planning and 
evaluation involves the selection of routes to be flown
Economic considerations dominate route evaluation:
Forecasts of potential passenger and cargo demand (as well as 
expected revenues) for planned route are critical to evaluations
Origin-destination market demand is primary source of demand and 
revenues for a given route, but far from the only source
In large airline hub networks, traffi c flow support to the new route 
from connecting flights can make it profitable
Airlines market share of total forecast demand for the new route 
depends on existence of current and expected future competition
The fundamental economic criterion for a planned route is potential 
for  incremental profitability in the short run, given the opportunity 
cost of taking aircraft from another route</text>

          <text>Approaches to Flight Profit Measurement
Ideally, add/change/remove a flight leg and then 
measure the profitability given that the rest of the 
network can be re-optimized
Captures interactive or network effects of both costs and revenues
Not easy as it requires a good model of the entire operation
Another approach  allocate all costs and revenues 
on a flight leg basis and then treat each leg as being 
independent of the rest of the network
Allocation schemes are always subjective
Does not capture network effects, very important in most cases
But, much easier to conceptualize</text>

          <text>Route Evaluation Issues
Practical considerations can be just as important:
Technical capability to serve a new route depends on availability of 
aircraft with adequate range and proper capacity
Performance and operating cost char acteristics of available aircraft 
in the airlines fleet determine economic profitability
If the route involves a new destination, additional costs of airport 
facilities, staff re-location, and sales offices must be considered
Regulations, bilaterals, and lim ited airport slots can impose 
constraints on new route operations , to the point of unprofitability
Strategic considerations can overlook lack of route 
profit:
Longer term competitive and market presence benefits of entering a 
new route even if it is expected to  be unprofitable in short run</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>11</slideno>
          <text>Incremental Revenues (SYR-OMA)
Two sources of incremental passenger revenues
Passengers boarding in SYR and deplaning in OMA 
(Local Revenue)
Passengers boarding in SYR and connecting in OMA to LAX or SFO 
(Connecting Revenue)
Connecting O-D revenues allocated to each flight leg
Proration methodology needed to split O&amp;D fare into component 
parts (e.g. mileage, ratio of full fares)
Or, assign total connecting O-D fare to flight leg being analyzed
Implicit assumption is that all revenues from a flight 
segment will be lost if the segment is cancelled
Reality is that airline might recapture some of this revenue</text>

passenger choice of different airline and schedule options
Depends to a large extent on presence and expected response of

          <text>Recent Trends: Hub Strengthening
Despite forecasts of more non-stop flights, a trend 
toward bigger and stronger hubs has re-emerged:
Largest US and European airlines have cut virtually all flights that 
do not originate or terminate at their hubs
Several smaller, weaker US hubs have been shut down
Factors that continue to reinforce hub growth:
Liberalized bilateral agreements have allowed airlines to fly even 
low-density international r outes from their hubs (e.g., CVG-MUC)
Small regional jets are being used to increase frequency of service 
to small spoke cities, not to over-fly the hub with non-stop service
Airline alliances focus on linkages between major hub networks
With recent economic downturn, importance of hub 
operations will likely continue</text>

          <text>Measuring Route Profitability
Airline costs are driven by fleet and flight schedule
Fleet drives fixed costs (capital costs) and variable cost rates (fuel 
burn rates, maintenance rates) 
Flight schedule drives utilization and thus variable costs
Costs are incurred on a flight basis and on a network basis
Airline revenues are driven by O-D markets
Prices are set by competitive considerations or by regulation
Revenues are earned on a passenger itinerary basis 
Scheduling  decisions are often made at the route and 
flight departure level
Airline managers must decide which flight legs to remove so that
other flight legs can be added</text>

Incremental cost of having more passengers on the connecting 
segments out of OMA
Opportunity Costs of selling seats beyond OMA, which could have 
been occupied by passengers from other O-D markets (known as 
network displacement costs)</text>

          <text>Hub Impacts on Route Planning
New routes to smaller spoke cities become much 
easier to justify in an established hub network:
An airline needs only 1 or 2 passengers per flight to each of 30+ 
connecting destinations to make a 100-seat aircraft profitable
However, such incremental analysis leads to a tendency to overlook 
potential displacement of other traffic on connecting legs
Same incremental logic makes it more difficult to stop service to a 
potentially unprofitable destin ation, which provides connecting 
traffic support to other flights
Difficult to justify a new non-stop service to by-pass 
the hub, as it might steal traffic from hub flights:
However, large number of departures in a connecting market can 
allow airline to build market share and perhaps introduce a non-
stop flight supported by many connecting opportunities</text>

          <text>Review: Basic Airline Hub Economics
Routing flights and passengers through a hub is 
more profitable for the airline if:
COST SAVINGS from operating fewer flights with larger aircraft 
and more passengers per flight
IS GREATER THAN
REVENUE LOSS from passengers who reject connecting 
service and choose a non-stop flight instead, if it exists
Passenger preference for multiple connecting 
departures vs. 1 or 2 non-stops per day:
Large multiple hub network operated by Delta, for example, 
provides over a dozen daily connections Boston-San Diego</text>

CREW $  869
FUEL $  904
MAINTENANCE $  875
OWNERSHIP $  767
TOTAL FOC $3415 per block-hr
Based on 1267 mile average stage length and 9.7 
block-hr daily utilization (weighted averages):
Different stage lengths and utilization by different airlines result in 
substantial variations in block-hour costs for same aircraft type
Also, differences in crew costs (union contracts, seniority), 
maintenance costs (wage rates), and ownership costs (age of a/c)</text>

Aircraft Productivity
Measured in ASMs generated per aircraft per day:
= # departures X average stage length X # seats
Aircraft utilization measured in block-hours/day:
Block hours begin at door close (blocks away from wheels) to door 
open (blocks under wheels)
Gate-to-gate time, including ground taxi times
Increased aircraft productivity achieved with:
More flight departures per day, either through shorter turnaround 
(ground) times or off-peak departure times
Longer stage lengths (average stage length is positively correlated 
with increased aircraft utili zation = block hours per day)
More seats in same aircraft type (no first class seating and/or 
tighter seat pitch)</text>

Flight Operating Costs
Flight operating costs (FOC) by aircraft type:
Reflect an average allocation of system-wide costs per block hour, 
as reported by airlines for each aircraft type
Can be affected by specific airline network or operational patterns
Collected by US DOT as Form 41 operating data from airlines
Typical breakdown of FOC for US carrier:
CREW:  Pilot wages and benefits
FUEL:  Easiest to allocate and most clearly variable cost
MAINTENANCE:  Direct airframe and engine maintenance cost, plus 
burden or overhead (hangars and spare parts inventory)
OWNERSHIP:  Depreciation, leasing costs and insurance</text>

Employee Productivity
Measured in ASMs per employee per period
As with aircraft, employee productivity should be 
higher with:
Longer stage lengths (amount of aircraft and traffic servicing for 
each flight departure not proportional to stage length)
Larger aircraft sizes (economies of scale in labor required per seat 
for each flight departure)
Increased aircraft productivity due to shorter turnaround times 
(more ASMs generated by aircraft contribute to positive employee 
productivity measures)
Yet, network airlines with long stage lengths and large 
aircraft have lower employee productivity rates</text>

Fleet composition is an optimal staging problem:
Number and type of aircraft required
Timing of deliveries and retirement of existing fleet
Tremendous uncertainty about future market conditions
Constrained by existing fleet, ability to dispose of older aircraft, and 
availability of future delivery slots
Aircraft evaluation criteria for airlines include:
Technical and performance characteristics
Economics of operations and revenue generation
Marketing and environmental issues
Political and international trade concerns</text>

          <text>Fleet Planning Process
Fleet planning requires an evaluation process for 
assessing the impacts of new aircraft (see next slide):
Traffic and yield forecasts used to estimate revenues
Planning ALF determines ASMs and number of aircraft required
Aircraft acquisition has financial impacts in terms of investment 
funding, depreciation, and interest expenses
Operating cost and revenue forecasts provide profit projections
Used to predict effects on balance sheet, cash flow, and debt load
This planning process is ideally an ongoing effort that 
requires input from many sources within the airline:

          <text>Bottom-Up (Micro) Approach
Much more detailed evaluation of routes and 
aircraft requirements allows what-if analysis, 
but requires detailed future scenarios:
Future route networks and schedules must be generated, 
and airlines share of total market demand is assumed
Forecasts of demand and revenues by origin-destination 
market are then allocated to each future flight
With more detailed inputs, bottom-up approach 
provides much more detailed outputs:

          <text>Aircraft Categories
Commercial aircraft are most commonly defined by 
their range and size:
The range is the maximum distance that it can fly without 
stopping for additional fuel, while still carrying a reasonable 
payload of passengers and/or cargo.
The size of an aircraft can be  represented by measures such as 
its weight, its seating or cargo capacity, as indicators of the amount 
of payload that it can carry.
Broad categories such as small, short-haul or 
large, long-haul aircraft can include several 
different aircraft types by different manufacturers.
Aircraft with similar capabilities are regarded as competitors in 
the airlines fleet planning decisions.  
For example, the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-800 are competing 
aircraft types, as they are both new generation aircraft with 
approximately 150 seats with similar range capabilities.</text>

          <text>Financial Evaluation of Aircraft Alternatives
Comparisons of aircraft economic performance based 
heavily on DOC (cash flow) analysis
Profit/loss approach includes aircraft depreciation
Averages training, financing, maintenance costs over aircraft life
Net Present Value (NPV) analysis can be used to 
incorporate time value of money
Depends on discount rate assumptions: Tendency is to assume too 
low for government-supported airlines; assume too high by private 
airlines trying to compensate for anticipated industry volatility
Cash flow NPV models combined with Monte Carlo 
simulation of uncertain variables
Probability distributions of fuel prices, exchange rates, traffic 
growth and yield assumptions
Result is a range of possible outcomes and expected value NPV</text>

          <text>Top-Down (Macro) Approach
Aggregate demand and cost spreadsheets used 
to evaluate financial impacts of aircraft options 
for a defined sub-system, region, or route:
Planning Load Factor establishes ASMs needed to 
accommodate forecast RPM growth (e.g., 70% planned ALF)
Capacity Gap defined as required future ASMs minus 
existing ASMs and planned retirements
Assumptions about average aircraft stage length and daily 
utilization determine aircraft productivity in ASMs per day, 
used to calculate number of aircraft required
Estimates of aircraft operating costs can then be used to 
compare economic performance of different aircraft types</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>12</slideno>
          <text>Aircraft Categories - Trends
Historically, largest aircraft were designed for routes 
with the longest flight distances.  
Relationship between aircraft size and range was almost linear.
Airlines wishing to serve a very long-haul non-stop route had to 
acquire the Boeing 747.
Airlines now have a much wider choice of products by 
range and capacity in each category:
Range of new aircraft in the small category (100-150 seats) has 
increased dramatically.
US transcontinental routes are now being flown with Boeing 737 
and Airbus 320 series aircraft.
Sizes of new long-range aircraft have decreased substantially.
Airlines even now serve certain low-demand long-haul non-stop 
international routes with Boeing 757 (180 seats) e.g., Newark to
Lisbon, and Los Angeles to Maui.</text>

          <text>Technical/Performance Characteristics
Payload/range curve is most important (next slide):
Defines capability of each aircraft type to carry passengers and
cargo over a maximum flight distance.
Affected by aerodynamics, engine technology, fuel capacity and 
typical passenger/cargo configuration
Typical shape of curve allows trade-off of payload for extra fuel and 
flight range, before maximum operational range is reached
Other important technical factors include:
Maximum take-off and landing weights determine runway length 
requirements and feasible airports
Fleet commonality with existing airline fleet reduces costs of 
training, new equipment and spare parts inventory for new types</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>Airline Fleet Composition
Fleet composition is critical long-term strategic 
decision for an airline.
Fleet is the total number of aircraft that an airline operates, as well 
as the specific aircraft types that comprise the total fleet.  
Each aircraft type has different technical performance 
characteristics e.g. capacity to carry payload over a maximum flight 
distance, or range.
Affects financial position, operati ng costs, and especially the ability 
to serve specific routes.
Huge capital investment with a long-term horizon:
US $40-60 million for narrow-body 150-seat airplane
$180+  million for wide-body long-range 747-400
Depreciation impacts on balance sheet last 10-15 years
Some aircraft have been operated economically for 30+ years</text>

          <text>Financial/Economic Issues
Required financing from internal or external sources:
Cash on hand, retained earnings,debt (loans) or equity (stocks) for 
aircraft purchases
Leasing rate can be more expensive, but more flexible, allowing for 
more frequent fleet renewal and requiring less up-front capital
Typical operating leases 3-7 years long, with or without options to 
extend, can include sub-leasing rights
Leases provide flexibility for an airline introducing a new aircraft 
type, or help with exit strategy for a given type
Financial evaluation to determine costs and revenues:
Up-front costs include purchase price, spare engines and parts, 
ground equipment, training
Newer aircraft offer lower operating costs at higher initial purchase 
price (vs. older aircraft that have been depreciated)
Increased revenue potential from larger and/or newer aircraft</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>17</slideno>
          <text>Other Aircraft Selection Criteria
Environmental factors:
Noise performance has become a major concern (Stage 3 noise 
requirements and and airport curfews on louder aircraft)
Air pollution regulations likely to ground older aircraft
Marketing advantages of newer aircraft:
Typically, most consumers have little aircraft preference
However, first airline with newest type or airline with youngest fleet 
can generate additional market share
Political and trade issues can dominate fleet 
decisions:
Pressure to purchase from a particular manufacturer or country, 
especially at government-owned national airlines</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>8</slideno>
          <text>Top-down vs. Bottom-up Fleet Planning
Top-down approach allows for rapid evaluation of 
new aircraft types, given high-level assumptions 
about:
Changes in traffic forecasts and/or operating costs (e.g., fuel price)
Airline structural changes (e.g., average stage length of flights)
Bottom-up approach provides substantially more 
detail:
Changes to individual route characteristics can be evaluated
But, very difficult to incorporate future competitors strategies
Simpler top-down approach is commonly used, since 
detailed 10-15 year scenarios are highly speculative: 
Likely to be inaccurate in face of changing market conditions
Political decisions can overrule best analysis of options</text>

2. ROUTE PLANNING
Given a fleet, selection of routes to be flown
Economic considerations dominate :
Forecasts of potential demand and revenues
Airlines market share of total forecast demand 
Opportunity cost of using aircraft on this route
Network implications for costs, revenues and profit
Practical considerations just as important:
Aircraft with adequate range and proper capacity
Performance and operating cost characteristics 
Operational constraints and aircraft/crew rotation issues
Regulations, bilaterals, and limited airport slots</text>

OR Models in Airline Scheduling
Airline scheduling problems have received 
most operations research (OR) attention
Use of schedule optimization models has led 
to impressive profit gains in:
Aircraft rotations; fleet assignment
Crew rotations; maintenance scheduling
Current focus is on solving larger problems:
Timetable optimization is still not feasible-- too many dimensions 
and constraints</text>

Airline Planning Decisions
1.FLEET PLANNING :  What aircraft to acquire/retire, 
when and how many?
2. ROUTE EVALUATION :  What network structure to 
operate and city-pairs to be served?
3. SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT :  How often, at what 
times and with which aircraft on each route?
4. PRICING :  What products, fares and restrictions for 
each O-D market?
5. REVENUE MANAGEMENT :  How many bookings to 
accept, by type of fare, to maximize revenue on 
each flight and over the network?</text>

Pricing Models
Pricing theory has not kept pace with airline 
competitive pricing practices
Difficult to  estimate  price elasticity, willingness to  pay, pote ntial fo r 
stimulation and div ersion
No practical tools for airlines to determine optimal prices
Some airlines are now implementing Pricing 
Decision Support Systems
Primarily monitoring of price changes
Little competitive modeling of pricing impacts
Dominant practice is to match low fares to fill 
planes and retain market share.</text>

4. PRICING DECISIONS
Differential pricing by airlines is universal: 
Classes o f service (First, Business, Coach)
Different fare products within th e coach cabin, with different 
restrictions, at different prices
Virtually every airline in the world offers multiple price points 
(even low-fare carriers with simplified fare structures)
Economic trade-off in pricing decisions:
Stimulation of new demand; increased market share for airline
Diversion of existing demand to lowe r fares; reduced revenues
Recent pricing difficulties of netw ork airlines due in part to greater 
diversion of revenues th an stimulation of demand</text>

Fleet Planning Decisions
Fleet planning is an optimal staging problem:
Number and type of aircraft required
Timing of deliveries and retirement of existing fleet
Tremendous uncertainty about future conditions 
Aircraft evaluation criteria for airlines include:
Technical and performance characteristics
Economics of operations and revenue generation
Marketing and environmental issues
Political and international trade concerns</text>

The Ultimate Challenge
Joint optimization and planning is a big 
challenge, both theoretically and practically: 
Few airlines have corporate databases with consistent and 
detailed demand/cost data
Research is still required to i dentify models that can capture 
dynamics and competitive behaviors
Organizational coordination within airlines and willingness to 
accept large-scale dec ision tool
Might never be possible to integr ate all subtleties of airline 
planning decis ions into a useful tool</text>

Integrated Airline Planning Models
As described, current practice is to perform 
scheduling, pricing and RM sequentially.
Integrated models would jointly optimize 
schedules, capacity, prices, and seat 
inventories:
Better feedback from pricing and RM systems can affect optimal 
choice of schedule and aircraft 
Better choice of schedule and capac ity can reduce need for 
excessive discounting and fare wars</text>

Example:  Airline Measures
A 200-seat aircraft flies 1000 miles, with 140 
passengers:
RPM = 140 passengers   X  1000 miles = 140,000
ASM = 200 seats  X  1000 miles = 200,000
Assume total revenue = $16,000; total 
operating expense = $15,000:
Yield = $16,000 / 140,000 RPM = $0.114 per RPM
Unit Cost = $15,000 / 200,000 ASM = $0.075 per ASM
Unit Revenue = $16,000 / 200, 000 ASM = $0.080 per ASM
Average Load Factor = RPM / ASM
ALF = 140,000 / 200,000 = 70.0%
For single flight, also def ined as passengers / seats</text>

1. FLEET PLANNING
Long-term strategic decision for an airline:
Affects financial pos ition, oper ating costs, and espec ially the 
ability to serve specific routes.
Huge capital investment with lasting impacts: 
US $40-60 million fo r narrow-body aircra ft
$200+  million for wide-body long-range 747-400
Depreciation impacts last 10-15 years
Some aircraft have been operated economically for 30+ years</text>

5. REVENUE MANAGEMENT
Inventory control for airlines:
Given a scheduled flight, capac ity and prices, how many book ings
to accept by fare type
Objective is to maximize revenue -- fill each seat with highest 
possible revenue
Computerized RM systems used by airlines to 
increase revenues by 4-6%:
Generate forecasts by flight date and fare class
Optimize seat alloc ations to different fare classes
Overbook ing models to minimize  costs of denied boardings and 
spoilage</text>

3. SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT
Involves several interrelated decisions, which 
to date have not been fully integrated:
Frequency Planning : Number of departures to be offered on each 
route, non-stop versus multi-stop
Timetable Development : Flight departure and arrival times, 
including connections at airline hubs
Fleet Assignment : Aircraft type for each flight, based on demand 
and operating cost estimates
Aircraft Rota tion Planning : Links consecutive flights to ensure 
balanced aircraft flows on the network.</text>

Route Profitability Models
OR models designed to perform such route 
evaluations, used by some airlines:
Demand, cost and revenue foreca sts for specific route, perhaps 
for multiple years into the future
Select routes to maximize profit s, given set of candidate routes
and estimated demands
Subjec t to fleet and capac ity constraints
Assessments should be based on total network impacts
Built on highly simplified assumptions:
Profit estimates entirely dependent on accuracy of demand 
estimates and market share models
Ability to integrate competitive effects is limited</text>

Background:  Fare Class Control
Vast majority of world airlines still practice fare class 
control:
High-yield (full) fare types in top booking classes
Lower yield (discount) fares in lower classes
Designed to maximize yields, not total revenues
Seats for connecting itineraries must be available in 
same class across all flight legs:
Airline cannot distinguish among itineraries
Bottleneck legs can block long haul passengers</text>

Value Bucket O-D Control
Allows O-D control with existing RM system:
Data collection and storage by leg/value bucket
Forecasting and optimization by leg/value bucket
Different ODF requests get different availability
But also has limitations:
Re-bucketing of ODFs disturbs data and forecasts
Leg-based optimization, not a network solution
Can give too much preference to  long-haul passengers (i.e..., 
greedy approach)</text>

O-D Control System Components
Much more than an optimization model:
Database Requirements :  Leg/bucket vs. ODF.
Forecasting Models :  Level of detail to match data; 
detruncation and estimation methods. 
Optimization Model :  Leg-based or network tools; 
deterministic vs. probabilistic; dynamic programs
Control Mechanism :  Booking classes vs. value buckets vs. 
bid price control.
Many effective combinations are possible:
Revenue gain, not optimality, is the critical issue.</text>

Displacement Cost Concept
Actual value of an ODF to network revenue on a leg is 
less than or equal to its total fare:
Connecting passengers can displace revenue on down-line (or up-
line) legs
How to determine network value of each ODF for O-D 
control purposes?

each flight leg

Value Buckets with Displacement
Given estimated down-line displacement, ODFs are 
mapped based on network value:
Network value on Leg 1 = Total fare minus sum of down-line leg 
displacement costs
Under high demand, availability for connecting passengers is 
reduced, locals get more seats
Revision of displacement costs is an issue:
Frequent revisions capture demand changes, but ODF re-mapping 
can disrupt bucket forecasts</text>

Potential for O-D Control
Simulations show potential O-D revenue gain:
As much as 1-2% additional gain over leg/class control under ideal 
simulation conditions
Network characteristics affect O-D benefits:
Substantial connecting traffic required
High demand factors on at least some feeder legs
Greater benefits with greater demand variability
CRS seamless availability links essential:
Different responses to different ODF requests</text>

The O-D Control  Problem
Revenue maximization over a network of connecting 
flights requires two strategies:
(1)  Increase availability to high-revenue, long-haul passengers, 
regardless of yield;
(2)Prevent long-haul passengers fr om displacing high-yield short-
haul passengers on full flights.
Revenue benefits of (1) outweigh risks of (2):
Probability of both connecting flights being fully booked is low, 
relative to other possible outcomes</text>

Value Bucket Implementation
Within Existing Booking Classes:
Fare codes need to be re-publishe d according to revenue value; no 
changes to inventory structure
Does not require seamless CRS links, but can be confusing to travel 
agents and consumers
Development of Virtual Inventory Classes:
Substantial cost of new inventory structure and mapping functions 
to virtual classes

Network vs. Heuristic Models
Estimates of displacement costs and bid prices can 
be derived using either approach:
Most O-D RM software vendors claim network optimal solutions 
possible with their product
Most airlines lack detailed data and face practical constraints in 
using network optimization models
Still substantial debate among researchers about which network  
O-D solution is most optim al
Revenue gain, not optimality, is critical issue</text>

Use of Network Optimization Tools
To date, few airlines have implemented network 
optimization for dynamic O-D control:
Lack of detailed historical ODF booking data
Technical and computational issues
Concerns about ODF demand forecasting accuracy (small numbers, 
high variance)
Difficult for RM analysts to interact with solutions
Recent RM developments have addressed first two 
issues, but other concerns remain.</text>

Revenue Value Bucket Concept
Fixed relationship between fare type and booking 
class is abandoned:
Booking classes (buckets) defined according to revenue value, 
regardless of fare restrictions
Each itinerary/fare type (i.e.., ODF) assigned to a revenue value 
bucket on each flight leg
ODF seat availability depends on value buckets
Value concept can be implemented within existing 
classes or through virtual classes</text>

Alternative Mechanism: Bid Price
Under value bucket control, accept ODF if its network 
value falls into an available bucket:
Network Value &gt; Value of Last Seat on Leg; or
Fare - Displacement &gt; Value of Last Seat
Same decision rule can be expressed as:
Fare &gt; Value of Last Seat + Displacement,  or
Fare &gt; Minimum Acceptable Bid Price for ODF
Bid Prices and Value Buckets are simply two different 
O-D control mechanisms.</text>

O-D Implementation Questions
Can we forecast ODF demand by flight date?
All network optimization methods require this input
Value buckets or bid price control?
Affected by other airline functions and RM users 
Which network optimization model?
Trade-off costs, revenue gains, robustness issues 
How will our RM business process change?

EMSR Heuristic Bid Price Control
EMSR value of the last available seat on each leg is 
used in a bid price decision rule.
Connecting ODF requests are accepted only if the 
total itinerary fare exceeds the current bid price:
Bid Price =MAX[EMSR1, EMSR2]  + d*MIN[EMSR1, EMSR2], 
where 0 &lt; d &lt; 1.00
Local (1-leg) requests are controlled by EMSR fare 
class booking limits.</text>

Leg-Based Heuristic Approaches
Several large airlines have implemented 
approximation models of network effects:
Estimates of displacement costs and/or bid prices based on 
leg/bucket EMSR calculations
Use existing inventory structure, databases, and RM system 
capabilities
Compatible with RM analyst work routines
Low-risk approach to O-D revenue gains, as an 
intermediate step to network optimization</text>

What is O-D Control?
The capability to respond to different O-D requests 
with different seat availability.
Can be implemented in a variety of ways:
Revenue value buckets (greedy approach) 
EMSR heuristic bid price
Displacement adjusted virtual nesting
Network optimal bid price control
All of the above can increase revenues, but each one 
has implementation trade-offs.</text>

O-D Bid Price Control
Much simpler inventory control mechanism than 
virtual buckets:
Simply need to store bid price value for each leg
Evaluate ODF fare vs. itinerary bid price at time of availability 
request
Must revise bid prices frequently to prevent too many bookings of 
ODFs at current bid price
Bid prices can be calculated with network 
optimization tools or leg-based heuristics</text>
