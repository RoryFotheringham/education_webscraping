KEY FACTOR: STRONG FIRMS (not 
necessarily large), highly competent in: 
product design, 
management, 
fitting consumer needs, 
linked to upstream suppliers and downstream 
markets, 
access to investment, 
-must compete in world markets to be strong, &amp; 
-the bulk of their innovation has to be by firms themselves [even if networked to others]</text>

          <text>Traditional Product Cycle Theory: 
Firm defines product 
Develops market 
Standardizes product 
One design dominates 
No. of competing companies reduced 
Product becomes a commodity (high volume, price drops,
low profit margin, product not unique) 
Production technology often then goes offshore 
Barriers to entry increase 
Surviving firms have: 
Capacity to advance their technology 
Large scale production 
Strong distribution and marketing 
Management talent to grow firm</text>

NIH too fragmented?

Unable to manage fundamental new science

FDA, Innovation/Stagnation 
FDA: applied science for medical product development
has not k
ept pace with basic science advance
Point: If our R&amp;D investment is in basic science and
not the 
follow-on process, there will be follow -on
problems in the system
The new science is not related to tech development
Little applied science work o n: creating new tools for
better 
answers on safety and effectiveness with faster
timeframes, more certainty, lower dev. cost

Failure rate for new drugs in clinical trials is increasing 
1993: 82% fail
2003: 91% fail
success rate in Stage 3 Clinical Trials declined from 80% in 1993 to
45% now
Cost of clinical trials is major
Top 20 pharmas spend 37% of R&amp;D on clinical trials - $31B/year
Time to market for drugs growing
8 years to market 50 years ago; over 14 years now

3rd Revolution: 
Combination of Rev 1 &amp; 2 methods and knowledge bases with a 
systems biology approach with new engineering design model
and toolset and physical sciences 
Brings in engineers not only for devices and but for design of
technology  also physical science
Biological model of complex, dynamic, interactive systems,merged with engineering priortizing and targeting design
The merger of biologists, engineers, physical scientists
ex: One -third of MIT engineers are now in some level of
biology research; BioX Stanford, UChicago, Weist Harvard,GaTech, UMich  but not NIH (NCI, NBIB)
Engineering tools  examples:
Targeted nanoparticles for delivery across cell walls, membranes
Polymer nanoparticles and quantum dots for treatment delivery
Next- generation magnetic nanoparticles for multimodal, non -invasive
tumor imaging
Implantable, biodegradable microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),
also known as lab -on-a- chip devices, for in vivo molecular sensing of
tumor- associated biomolecules
Low-toxicity nanocrystal quantum dots for biomedical sensing

in the science technology and tools need for drug development andapproval
Requires multidisciplinary teams rather than individual investigator model

benefit the overall
process, dont accrue to particular firms = its a public

LOOSE, INFORMAL ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL 
Non-bureaucratic org., loose, interacting groups teams Leadership based
solely on talent 
easy comraderie; casual tone; interactive 
long hours 
Almost all scientists  few in support staff  at first, 36 scientists, 1 secretary 
ABILITY OF LAB HEAD TO GO TOP 
Loomis heads Microwave Comm above Rad Lab  reports officially to V. 
Bush of NDRC - Lee Dubridge (later Caltech Pres)heads Rad Lab on site 
BUT- Loomis frequently goes directly to War Sec. Stimson 
Loomis forces slow military bureaucracy to adopt new technology

Summary, cont 3) Populous low income countries such as
China and India can compete with the US in
high tech by having many S&amp;E specialists
although those workers are a small proportion
of their work forces . This threatens to undo the
"North -South" pattern of trade in which
advanced countries dominate high tech whiledeveloping countries specialize in less skilled
manufacturing.
4) Diminished comparative advantage in high-
tech will create a long period of adjustment for
US workers , of which the off-shoring of IT jobs
to India, growth of high-tech production in
China, and multinational R&amp;D facilities in
developing countries, are harbingers.
To ease the adjustment to a less dominant
position in science and engineering, the US
will have to develop new labor market and
R&amp;D policies that build on existing strengths
and develop new ways of benefitting from
scientific and technological advances in other
countries.20</text>

          <text>What Online Ed Can Do Online learning can support
an education shift  new tool :
Tool for visualization,
representation, reinforcement
and  assessment .
Using feedback loops and
repetition tied to continuous
assessment, online can convey
information and content,reinforcing both.
Online will have features better
than lectures and could force
interactive classrooms and
restructuring of face- to-face
learning.

          <text>Freeman,summary This paper develops four propositions
that show that changes in the global job
market for science and engineering
(S&amp;E) workers are eroding US
dominance in S&amp;E, which diminishes
comparative advantage in high techproduction 
and creates problems for
American industry and workers:
(1) The U.S. share of the world's science
and engineering graduates is declining
rapidly as European and Asian
universities, particularly from China,
have increased S&amp;E degrees while US
degree production has stagnated.
2) The job market has worsened for
young workers in S&amp;E fields relative to
many other high-level occupations,
which discourages US students from
going on in S&amp;E, but which still has
sufficient rewards to attract large
immigrant flows, particularly fromdeveloping countries.19</text>

The US Secondary Educational System is not
Preparing our Students for Math, Science or
Engineering Majors and too Few Students end up
majoring in disciplines for high-tech careers.
Faltering secondary education system: fewer than 15%
of high school graduates have sufficient mathematics
and science credentials to even begin pursuing an
engineering degree , and 40% of four-year college
students end up taking at least one remedial course.
To keep up with a more competitive global

scoring students - not pressured to indicate what

          <text>Story Three: The Scale Up Problem 
We have three manufacturing sectors
Big multinationals  they are global, they can get production
ef
ficiencies by producing in lower cost countries and they must be in
all the global markets
Theyre OK, although they are increasingly producing abroad
+Two More Vulnerable Sectors:
Main Street firms  they do most of our manufacturing, there are30
0,000 small and mid-size firms
They have trouble getting production s cale up funding , theyre thinly
ca
pitalized, must be risk adverse to survive, and dont do R&amp;D
(although they can be very innovative about process)
Our entrepreneurial startups that make something 
they do well until they have to sc ale up for production of their
product  they lack financing for scale- up here  Venture firmsdont fund this  send startups to contract mfgs. In Asia
So they turn to contract manufacturers abroad

Importantly, me dian income of men with no high
school diploma fell 20%, men with h.s. diploma
or some college fell 13%, between 1990 &amp; 2013.
Growing income split between college and non-

Major rise in U.S. income inequality
Restoring manufacturing was a frequently cited
sub

sector affects our services sector 
U.S.: 80% services economy
But increasingly  the 21st century firm ties
complex products to services  to offer solutions
Tradeable goods are tied to services, which
makes the service tradeable
Personal services are face to face, dont scale
But with the tradeable good, you can scale both
the good 
and the service
So: success in production increasingly tied tosuccess in services, &amp; 
vice versa
Scaling is how an economy grows
Lose the product, cant scale the service either23</text>

But Germany is high wage and high cost  Germa n
wages and benefits are 66% higher than the U.S.
They run a major manufacturing surplus, including ama

They have a deep ecosystem for their manufacturers,sma

          <text>Story Four: The Tie between 
Innovation and Production 
So what if they scale up abroad? Whats the
probl
em?
Because for most products you need to tie
innovation very closely to 
initial production
You need dense feedback loops as you do productde
sign- initial production requires very creative
engineering and design  its part of innovation
So if you shift production capability, in many casesin
novation capability has to follow it
Innovation is the U.S. strong suit  its what we dobest
But the MIT report finds that if many of ourimportant innovations have to 
follow production,
then we are endangering our innovation strength
And Innovation is the key factor in growth20</text>

 Chinas form of innovative manufacturing 
spe
cializes in rapid scale -up and cost reduction 
 Joins unparalleled skills in simultaneous man
agement of tempo, production volume, and 
cost. 
 So production is able to scale up quickly and with maj
or reductions in unit cost. 
 This has enabled China to expand even in industries tha
t are highly automated or not on governmental 
priority lists, despite limited labor cost advantage or government subsidies, respectively. 
 So low costs and govt support are not sufficient to expl
ain Chinas success in manufacturing.

Missing an innovation wave is serious: Japan led quality

With global economy, as sumption of innovate

In some industrial sectors, can now sever R&amp;D

 design from production
RISK &gt; innovate Here/Produce There
That brings the econ omic foundation of our
innovation -based economy into question. Why
invest in innovation here if gains elsewhere ?
Last 25 years  IT/ electronics allowed severing of
R&amp;D/design from production via IT -based specs;

 We are producing more than ever so have had enormous 
P
roductivity gains in agriculture 
 But the MIT report tells us this manufacturing is not agriculture 
 We lost 5.8 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010 
 We thought manufacturing output was holding firm, but it wasnt -
on reexamination were finding it was in decline 
 So we didnt the productivity gains we thought we got 
 Our job loss tells us our manufacturing sector is hollowing out

We used to have firms and supply chains that were very

We hit on a financial model of emphasizing quarterlyret

So: innovation policy challenge: 
Need to scaleup innovative startups for production of new technologies 
But financial support for non -IT startups in sharp decline 
Are new policy models emerging to fix this? 
Innovation Orchards idea fits  substitute space for capital 
Rich technology, equipment, know-how space for startups 
Help get them through advanced prototype, demo, testing, pilot production 
Cyclotron Road, TechBridge provide working models 
Another missing link: connect startups to small
manufacturers 
Can link startup incubators to startups with MEPs --in every state  Greentown 
Labs/MassMEP example 
Can this work? Feds  no new money, cant create 
new programs 
But these policy fixes are already authorized, have low capital costs, better

IDEA They need each other -startups need 
production, manufacturers dont do R&amp;D, need innovation access 
46 startups a Greentown; 33 Startups were interested in linking to SME 
manufacturers from 7 different locations across eastern Mass. 
83 Manufacturers were interested in working with and connected to 
Startups. 
120 Connections were made between Startups and Manufacturers. 
People intensive effort  online matching wont work 
10 Workshops held by Greentown Labs 
Over 100 office hours held at Greentown Labs 
8 outside startup support networks expressed interest in learning from the Initiative 
16 Partnerships were formed between Startups and local Manufacturers. 
Basic training for startups on production could go online and scale; but 
personal relationship-building critical  its a marriage, love required

Must compete on price on day one no time to drive down cost 
curve 
Legacy sectors: well- defended castles 
Protected by technological -economic- political -social paradigms 
Need startups to bring new technologies to Legacy sectors 
Like: new energy technologies

          <text>Step Two: Policy Packages
Matched to Launch Categories 
(1) Front End Support : 
Needed for all technologies 
Examples - research and development (R&amp;D),
technology prototyping and demonstrations (P&amp;D),public -private R&amp;D partnerships, monetary prizes to
individual inventors and innovative companies, andsupport for technical education and training 
(2) Back End Incentives (carrots) to encourage technology 
deployment: 
Needed for secondary (component) technologies 
Examples - tax credits for new energy technology 
products, loan guarantees, price guarantees,
government procurement programs, new product buy-down programs

Innovation Orchards 
Already rich innovation cluster in Boston, but scale- up 
issue 
Need: technology and equipment rich space for startups 
full of know- how  use regional support to build 
for: advanced prototyping, demonstration, testing - perhaps 
small lot pilot production 
Gets startup down scale-up curve 
De-risking  get them into range of more traditional financing 
Could accelerate the innovation  better than VC fix 74</text>

Precedents for increased government spending
on similar scale (in 2002 dollars) 
Apollo Program ($185 billion over 9 years), 
Carter/Reagan defense buildup ($445 billion 
over 8 years), 
Doubling NIH ($138 billion over 5 years) 
Ballistic Missile Defense ($145 billion over the first 6 years - actual dollars). 
These are examples of the needed size and scope
of 
a technology development program (including
implementation), not the way such a program 
should be organized 24</text>

          <text>A Carbon Charge (Carbon Tax or Cap- and-
Trade) Market- based Incentive would be 
useful but is unlikely for some time 
A price on CO2 captures externalities 
Sends an unmistakable price signal to energy users 
Enables new entrants to enter and start to 
drive down the cost curve 
Only works if it is sustained and high 
enough 
But: politically unlikely in the U.S. anytime 
soon 32</text>

          <text>Market Launch --New Four -Step 
Analysis: 
1. Launch Pathways: Group technologies to be 
implemented into categories based on launch 
characteristics 
2. Tie to Policy Packages: Use these launch pathways 
to guide federal innovation policy roles: 
Bundle policies, available across technologies, so as 
to be as technology neutral as possible. 
3. Gap Analysis: to identify gaps between existing 
institutions in the innovation system 
4. Recommendations for Institutional Innovations to fill 
these gaps

          <text>Example, MITs The Engine 
Some Univs have incubators  tend to be early stage, 
business plan development 
But: for hard technologies, tech scale up is the challenge  
The Engines role  advd prototype, demo, testing, pilot 
production 
Issue: grad school for hard tech startups  draw from 
area incubators 
Access to MIT facilities  dont lose your ID card when you 
graduate  treat startup grads as part of the family 
6 startups in residence now, for 2 years (too short?), can be 
many more in non-residence support status 
Bridge funding  MIT $25m, want $100m 
Blend Cyclotron Road and TechBridge?

prototyping capability) and Draper, but also area companies.77</text>

          <text>!This multiplier effect reflects how manufacturings
linkages run deep into the overall economy and means
that improvements in manufacturing productivity
translate broadly into the economy as a whole. 
!Many service sector jobs are tied tightly to domesticmanufacturing; their number will expand or contractwith the size of the manufacturing base. 
!Must embrace new technologies, processes and
efficiencies for productivity gain in manufacturing. 
"Manufacturing is the currency of intl trade, not services 
 but trade deficits  
$812B in mfg. goods 2008 (pre-recession; surplus in
services: only $139B) 
- too big a gap for US intl services sector to offset
huge role of mfg. 
- similar $800B+ deficit in mfg. goods in 2016

          <text>6.Prospector Theory 
Romer argues that talent (engaged in research) is 
the pacing mechanism for innovation -based growth 
Develops Prospector Theory (not in this article) 
Reviews the chemical engineering sector in the 3nd half of the 19
th century 
Germany and Britain dominate the sector 
Because they created institutions to train large numbers 
of chemical engineers 
Its like the California Gold Rush in 1849---
The nation/region that creates a strong talent pool in a 
sector  ie, the largest number of well -trained 
prospectors  will find the most gold (ie,dominate 
technical advance) 21</text>

          <text>7.Romer on Growth, Trade, and 
Research Relationships (pp. 212 -215): 
Growth is co- related with the degree of integration into world 
markets 
Having a large number of consumers or large population is not key 
 not a substitute for trade with other nations 
Trade forces economic integration with a large pool of human 
capital 
Economy with large stock of human capital (engaged in research)fosters economic growth 
Accounts for unprecedented growth of 20th century economies 
Less developed economies can benefit from access to human capitalvia trade and the integration it brings (story of growth in Asian economies) 
Closed economies stagnate

Merrill Lynch Report 
(http://www.slideshare.net/tseitlin/intro -to-nanotechno logy-merrill -lynch ) 
BASIC POINT: how do investors look at potentialtechnology breakthroughs? Do they believe theydrive growth? 
GROWTH PATTERN: 
Merrill Report cites its economist Norman Poire 
Poire: growth innovations drive the economy and stock market 
Takes 28 years for wide acceptance of a new technology 
Takes 56 years for rapid growth to evolve 
Takes 112 years for technology maturity  after that, growth in the technology area parallels growth of population rates

          <text>Paul Krugman on the Neoclassical 
Economic Challenge in the 2008 
Financial Crisis: 
As I see it, the economics profession went astray 
because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive -looking mathematics, for truth. () But 
while sabbaticals at the Hoover Institution and job opportunities on Wall Street are nothing to sneeze at, the central cause of the professions failure was the desire for an all -encompassing, intellectually elegant 
approach that also gave economists a chance to show 
off their mathematical prowess. -Paul Krugman,

!In the Interplay between machine and human:
!comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing
routine, codifiable tasks
!But it also amplifies the comparative advantage of workers in supplying
problem -solving skills, adaptability, and creativity .
!Frontier of automation is rapidly advancing -
!challenge to substituting machines for workers in tasks requiring flexibility,
judgment, and common sense remains immense .
!In many cases, machines both substitute for and complement human labor .
!Focus only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism -

!Fixing the growth rate is tied to growing productivity, which is tied to technological innovation
!Problem: traditional infrastructure (repairing roads, sewers) isnt technological innovation  it is
not productivity enhancing
!Yet we have have a big productivity growth problem a traditional infrastructure bill wont fix
!We already rode those surface transportation innovation waves, they largely played out
!And how much can we do? Obama Stimulus was only able to spend $25 billion on
transportation  not that many shovel ready projects
!Its not bad  could help in unemployment in lower skilled working class, but a high growth rate
fixes a lot of problems, and this wont do that

INEQUALITY, CONT 
!Rising demand for educated labor in advanced economies, including US
!If the supply of educated labor does not keep pace with persistent outward shifts
in demand for skills, the skill premium will rise.
!In the words of the Red Queen in Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland, ittakes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.
!When the rising supply of educated labor began to slacken in the early 1980s(college graduation rate stabilizes between 1975 -1982, only starts rising again
in 2004), a logical economic consequence was an increase in the college skill
premium .

!Last three decades: polarization of the labor market
!Wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top
!Employment growth was at the bottom of the income and skill distribution,
!Not for those in the middle.
!1940-1970:
!physically demanding, repetitive, dangerous, and cognitively monotonous work receded, because of
extraordinary productivity gains in agriculture.
!Rising consumer affluence spurred demand for manufactured goods and leisure complements.
!Growth of technologically intensive corporations, health care services, and higher education created
employment for credentialed professionals
!and a cadre of supporting clerical, administrative, and sales workers.
!automation was reducing labor demand across large number of occupations, but overall job prospectsappeared broadly favorable during period.
!1980-2010
!professional, technical, and managerial occupationsgrew even more rapidly
!Skilled blue-collar occupations shrank rapidly
!clerical and sales occupationsthe vulnerable production jobs of the information agedeclined

!Traditional Economics: technological advance , since the industrial
!revolution, including automation, always creates net new jobs  has
that now changed?
!COMPLEMENTARITY: automation has not wiped out a majority ofjobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for labor
as it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raisesoutput in ways that lead to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustmentsin labor supply. Indeed, a key observation of the paper is that journalists and even
expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for humanlabor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor thatincrease productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor.

!Brynjorfsson and McAfee (in Second Machine Age ):

!But view rising inequality as more manageable  tax policy can help:
!Pigouvian taxes (tax on business for engaging in specific negative activity), carbon tax, and

!based on this find 47% of US jobs have high likelihood of being replaced by automation
!Rob Atkinson, ITIF:
!Attacks Frey and Osborne: their list of occupations to be replaced are experiencing low productivity gains
!they assume a highly unlikely 3% labor productivity rate  havent seen since 19th century
!They also assume there is a fixed amount of work (lump of labor fallacy)
!but work is more dynamic, unemployment can be offset by the introduction of new goods or more goods into
the market, by shorter working days, or by a combination of the two that is decided by society.

!The problem now is not automation it s Secular Stagnation  
!Term developed in the 1930s by Alvin Hansen - economy ends up stuck with low growth and high
unemployment because of a shortfall of investment
!Larry Summers returns in 2013 to this theory -with interest rates around zero, U.S. output is insufficient to
support full employment.
!factors hampering investment demand: decreasing population growth, a relative decrease in the cost of
capital goods, and excess money being retained not used by large corporations .
!on savings side, excessive reserve holdings among developing countries, post crisis financial regulations,
inequality and increasing intermediation costs.
!excess of savings over investment slows growth and increases unemployment.
!instead of supply creating its own demand, demand is unable to create sufficient supply
!Calls for fiscal stimulus
!Overall  US has: low productivity , low capital investment, low growth rate, growing inequality , declining middle

!Issue: steep, persistent rise of earnings inequality
!in the U.S. labor market
!and in developed countries generally
!Why Look at Inequality?
!First, earnings premium for education has risen across a large number of advanced nations
!this rise contributes substantially to the net growth of earnings inequality
!In the US, 2/3s of the overall rise of earnings dispersion between 1980 and 2005 is accounted for by the increased premium
associated with schooling in general and postsecondary education in particular
!Second, literature finds that interplay between the supply and demand for skills provides insight into why the
skill premium has risen,
!specifically, the earnings gap between college and high school graduates has more than doubled in the United States over the
past three decades .
!Third - skill premium offers insight into the evolution of inequality within a market economy,
