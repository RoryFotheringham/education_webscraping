Power Distribution
Problem:  The group constants depend on the flux itself.
Criticality:  Set              and          equal to zero. 
Perform two multigroup calculations:
Use a library code to obtain  cross sections and average them by treating spatial 
and time dependence very cr udely.  Calculate the intragroup fluxes relying on 
models of neutron slowing down and 
thermalization, e.g., assuming that                       for energies between 1 
eV and 105eV,                           in the high-en ergy range, and proportional to the 
Maxwellian distribution for thermal energies.
This fine spectrum calculation may involve as many as 1000 groups.
These intragroup fluxes are, then, used to calculate the group constants for a 
coarse group calculation with spatial dependence.  Iteration is possible.
LWRs:   Usually three fast groups and one thermal.
Fast Reactors:  As many as 20 groups.t v1 g

Time Dependence
To study the time-dependence of the flux we have to solve the multigroup 
equations in slide 3 augmented to include the equations for delayed neutrons.
There are two time scales:
Short-term changes (seconds) due to tempera ture effects and external deliberate 
changes
Long-term changes (hours or more) due to fuel depletion and fission-product 
buildup.</text>

General Aspects
Design Objective
Safe, reliable, economical operation at the rated power level over the core 
lifetime.
Interaction with other disciplines
Thermal considerations determine core size and geometry.
The length of time a fuel element can utilized is determined by its ability to 
withstand radiation damage and thermal/mechanical stresses.
The design process is iterative drawing heavily on past experience.</text>

Reactivity Feedback
The reactivity depends on the neutron density (or power level) itself.
This is due to the fact that k depends on macroscopic cross sections, which 
themselves involve the atomic number densities of the materials:
The atomic density depends on the power level because:
Material densities depend on temperature,  which, in turn, de pends on the power 
distribution
The buildup of poisons and burnup of fuel (long-term effect).
We write

which        is zero.

Core Composition Changes  Fission Product Poisoning
Some fission products have large thermal absorption cross section.  The 
poisoning effect is insignificant for fast reactors.

We measure the impact of a poison by calculating the reactivity decrease it 
causes.
The thermal utilization                       is the only factor that is appreciably

10 CFR 50.68 Criticality Accident Requirements (2)
 If no credit for soluble boron is taken, the k-e ffective of the spent fuel storage racks loaded 
with fuel of the maximum fuel assembly r eactivity must not exceed 0.95, at a 95 percent 
probability, 95 percent confidence level, if floo ded with unborated water. If credit is taken for 
soluble boron, the k-effective of the spent fuel storage racks loaded with fuel of the maximum 
fuel assembly reactivity must not exceed 0.95 , at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent 
confidence level, if flooded with borated water,  and the k-effective must remain below 1.0 
(subcritical), at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent confidence level, if flooded with 
unborated water.
 Radiation monitors are provided in storage and associated handling areas when fuel is present 
to detect excessive radiation levels and to initiate appropriate safety actions.
 The maximum nominal U-235 enrichment of the fre sh fuel assemblies is limited to five (5.0) 
percent by weight.</text>

Point Kinetics
Recall (slide 6):
Local perturbations, e.g., by moving  the control rods, leads to a read justment of            
that is usually slight and happens in a fe w milliseconds.  Then, the readjusted shape 
rises or falls as a whole depending on  whether the perturbation increased or 
decreased k.
Point kinetics allows us to investigate th e level (or average) flux assuming that the 
shape does not change appreciably.
We average over all energy gro ups and write the neutron density as                           
n(t) is the total neutron density or the total power

Fuel Depletion (Burnup)
During reactor operation, fuel (235U) is depleted and new fuel (239Pu) is produced.
There is a net decrease of reactivity over time.
In general,
is the neutron fluence
The dependence of the flux on the fuel  density complicates the calculations.
In lieu of the fluence, it is customary to use the thermal  energy output per unit mass of 
fuel (burnup) in MWD/T (MW days per metric ton of uranium fuel).
Current limit:  62 GWd/T.  For a 1,000 MW  PWR, burnup is about 15 GWd/T after 
one year.[]) t , r ( exp ) , r ( N ds ) s , r ( exp ) , r ( N ) t , r ( Na

In general, failure consequences for U02have been insignificant below 
300 cal/g for both irradiated and unirradiated fuel rods. Therefore, a 
calculated radial average energy density of 280 cal/g at any axial fuel 
location in any fuel rod as a result of a postulated rod ejection accident

will be minimal and that both shor t-term and, long-term core cooling

General Design Criteria 27 and 28
Criterion 27--Combined reactivity control systems capability . The reactivity control 
systems shall be designed to have a combined capability, in conjunction with 
poison addition by the emergency core cooling system, of reliably controlling 
reactivity changes to assure that under postulated accident conditions and with 
appropriate margin for stuck rods the capability to cool the core is maintained.
Criterion 28--Reactivity limits . The reactivity control systems shall be designed 
with appropriate limits on the potential am ount and rate of reactivity increase to 
assure that the effects of postulated reac tivity accidents can neither (1) result in 
damage to the reactor coolant pressure boundary greater than limited local yielding 
nor (2) sufficiently disturb the core, its support structures or other reactor pressure 
vessel internals to impair significantly the capability to cool the core. These postulated reactivity accidents shall include consideration of rod ejection (unless prevented by positive means), rod dropout, steam line rupture, changes in reactor 
coolant temperature and pressure, and cold water addition.</text>

The Single-Failure Criterion
Fluid and electric systems are considered to be designed against an 
assumed single failure if neither (1) a single failure of any active component (assuming passive components function properly) nor (2) a 
single failure of a passive component (assuming active components 
function properly), results in a loss of the capability of the system to 
perform its safety functions.
The intent is to achieve high relia bility (probability of success) without 
quantifying it.
Looking for the worst possible single failure leads to better system 
understanding.</text>

characteristics tends to compensate  for a rapid increase in reactivity.</text>

Design Basis Accidents
NUREG/CR-6042, USNRC, 1994.A DBA is a postulated accident  that a facility is designed 
and built to withstand without exceeding the offsite 
exposure guidelines of the NRCs siting regulation (10 CFR Part 100).
Each DBA includes at least one significant failure of a component.  In general, fail ures beyond those consistent 
with the single-failure criterion are not required (unlike in PRAs).</text>

Siting Criteria (10 CFR 100)
Consideration of:
Characteristics of reactor design
Population characteristics, exclusion area , low population zone, population center 
distance
9Assume a bounding fissio n product release base d on a major accident
9Define an exclusion area of such size th at an individual located at any point on 
its boundary for two hours immediatel y following the accident would not 
receive a total radiation dose to the wh ole body in excess of 25 rem (250 mSv) 
or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem (3000 mSv) to the thyroid from 
iodine exposure.
9Define a low population zone of such size that an individual located at any 
point on its outer boundary who is expose d to the radioactive cloud during the 
entire period of its passage would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole 
body in excess of 25 rem (250 mSv) or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem (3000 mSv) to the thyroid from iodine exposure.

Principles of License Renewal
The regulatory process is ade quate to ensure the safety of 
all currently operating plants, with the possible exception of 
the detrimental effects of aging on certain SSCs.
10 CFR 54 focuses on managing the adverse effects of aging.
Plant-specific licensing basis must be maintained during the 
renewal term in the same manner and to the same extent as during the original licensing term.</text>

6. The reactor is isolated after the initiation of the accident, 
i.e. the regular heat sink is removed.  
PWR: Upon initiation of the accident the steam

Professor Neil Todreas9Appendix C: Basic Assumptions of the LOCA
1. The reactor has been operating for an infinite period of time 
at an assumed slight overpower condition. No power or other 
transient preceeds the accident.
2. Peak core power density or lin ear power generation is at the 
maximum allowable value.
3. A double-ended rupture of one primary coolant loop is 
assumed (largest existing pipe)
PWR: rupture of cold leg imposes most severe conditions
BWR: rupture of a recirculation loop
Remaining intact loops continue their operation as 
dictated by available electric supply or stored rotational 
energy.
4. Off-site power is lost upon initiation of the accident and is 
restored after several days. (continued)</text>

Summary of the Expert Opinion Elicitation Process 
 Formal elicitation process used to estimate generic BWR and PWR 
passive-system LOCA frequencies associat ed with material degradation.  
 Developed qu antitative estimates for pi ping and non-piping base cases for 
anchoring elicitation responses. 
 Panelists provided quantitative es timates supported by qualitative 
rationale for underlying technical is sues in individual elicitations. 
 Generally good agreement about LOCA contributing factors. 
 Large individual uncertainty and panel variability in quantifying 
estimates. 
 Quantitative resu lts determined by aggregatin g ind ividual panelists 
estimates. 
 LOCA  elicitation provides a suffi cient technical basis to support 
transition break size development.

 NRC staff adjusted results of expert elicitation process
to account for: uncertainties in elicitation process,
LOCAs caused by inadvertent actuation of active
components, LOCAs caused by large loads (such as
heavy loads, seismic, waterhammer), and other
considerations (such as degradation in specific piping,
specific pipe sizes). Selecting the TBS</text>

 BWR Plants 
 Thermal fatigue, intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC), 
mechanical fatigue, flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) identified as important
degradation mechanisms. 
 Increased operating transients (e.g., water hammer) compared to PWR
plants. 
 BWR community has more experience identifying and mitigating
degradation due to IGSCC experience in the early 1980s. 
 BWR service experience must be carefully evaluated due to preponderance
of pre-mitigation IGSCC precursor events. 
 PWR Plants 
 Primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC), thermal fatigue, and 
mechanical fatigue identified as important degradation mechanisms. 
 PWSCC concerns paramount for panel. 
 Near-term frequency increases due to PWSCC are likely before effective
mitigation is developed. 
 Most panelists believe that issue will be successfully resolved within the
next several years. Elicitation Insights: BWR &amp; PWR Plants</text>

Breaks larger than the TBS (50.46a) 
 The evaluation must be performed fo r a number of postulated LOCAs of 
different sizes and locations suffici ent to provide assurance that the most 
severe postulated LOCAs larger than  the TBS up to the double-ended 
rupture of the largest pipe in the reactor coolant system are analyzed. 
These calculations may take credit for the availability of offsite power and 
do not require the assumption of a single failure. Realistic initial 
conditions and availability of safety -related or non safety-related 
equipment may be assumed if supported by plant-specific data or analysis . 
 (i) Coolable geometry . Calculated changes in core geometry must be such that 
the core remains amenable to cooling. 
 (ii) Long term cooling . After any calculated successful initial operation of the
ECCS, the calculated core temperature must be maintained at an acceptably 
low value and decay heat must be removed for the extended period of time 
required by the long-lived radioactivity remaining in the core.</text>

Piping Base Case Development 
 All elicitation responses relative to the base cases. 
 Base case conditions specify the piping system, piping size, material, loading, 
degradation mechanism(s), and mitigation procedures. 
 Five Base Cases Defined. 
 BWR 
 Recirculation System (BWR-1) 
 Feedwater System (BWR-2) 
 PWR 
 Hot Leg (PWR-1)

Overconfidence Adjustment 
 Experts are generall y overconfident about their uncertainty. 
 Demonstrated using almanac-type questions with kno wn a nswers. 
 Rule of thumb: true coverage level is ap proximately half the nominal 
coverage level. 
 Nominal elicitation coverage level: 90% (95th 5th percentiles) 
 Implication is that true coverage level i s about 50% (75th 25th 
percentile). 
 Evaluate the effect of adjust ing the nominal coverage level.

	Baseline method uses geometric mean of the individual panelist estimates
to determine group estimates for all total LOCA frequency parameters: 
5th, 50th, 95th, mean. 
	Based on assumed lognormal structure of individual estimates. 
	Ensures estimates are not significantly influenced by outliers. 
	Results using median or trimmed geometric mean are similar to 
baseline method. 
	Alternative method is to use the arithmetic mean all the individual 
panelist distributions (mixture distribution). 
 Assumes that individual results are obtained from equally credible 
models that are randomly sampled from population of models. 
	Key regulatory parameters may be dominated by outliers. 
	Difference between 5th and 95th percentiles is much wider.

Technology-Neutral Regulatory Framework 
(NUREG-1860)
 This alternative to 10 CFR 50 woul d have the following advantages:
It would require a broader use of design-specific risk information in 
establishing the licensing basis, thus better focusing the licensing basis, its safety analysis and regulatory oversight on those items most important to safety 
for that design.
It would stress the use of performance as the metrics for acceptability, thus 
providing more flexibility to designers to decide on the design factors most 
appropriate for their design.
It would be written to be applicable to any reactor technology, thus avoiding the time consuming and less predictable process of reviewing non-LWR designs against the LWR oriented 10 CFR 50 regulations, which requires case-
by-case decisions (and possible litigation) on what 10 CFR 50 regulations are 
applicable and not applicable and where new requirements are needed.
It would provide the foundation for technology-specific implementation, 
through the use of technology-specific implementing guidance in those areas unique to a specific technology.</text>

Protective Strategies
 The protective strategies address accident prevention and mitigation and consist of 
the following:
physical protection (provides pr otection against intentional acts);
maintaining stable operation (provides measures to reduce the likelihood of challenges to 
safety systems);
protective systems (provides highly reliable  equipment to respond to challenges to 
safety); 
maintaining barrier integrity (provides isol ation features to prevent the release of 
radioactive material into the environment); and
protective actions (provides planned activities to mitigate any impacts due to failure of 
the other strategies).</text>

Notes
 With the exception of the source term, realis tic calculations are carried out to obtain 
the mean and uncertainty distribution of the important parameters for estimating 
frequency and consequences.
 Source Term calculations use the 95% probability value of the amount of 
radionuclides released, obtained from a  mechanistic calculation, and use RG 1.145 
or the equivalent for calculating atmospheric dispersion.

Why Risk-Informed Design?
The NRC is preparing a new risk-informed licensing 
process for future reactors.
DOE (NERAC) goals refer to reliable reactivity control and decay heat removal.
Important uncertainties are identified early.
The combination of the structuralist (i.e., defense in depth) 
and the rationalist (i.e., risk-based) safety philosophies 
could be addressed early in the process.
Design options can be compared.
PRA methodological needs are identified early so that 
improvements can be made.

Defense in Depth
 The defense-in-depth principles address the various types of uncertainty (i.e.,
parameter, modeling and completeness) and require designs to:
consider intentional as well as inadvertent events;
include accident preventio n and mitigation capability;
ensure key safety functions are not depe ndent upon a single element of design, 
construction, maintenance or operation;
consider uncertainties in equipment and human performan ce and provide appropriate 
safety margin;
provide alternative capability to prevent unacc eptable releases of radioactive material; 
and
be sited at locations that facilitate pr otection of public health and safety.</text>

Comments on the F-C Curve
 The PRA results must demonstrate that the total integrated risk from the PRA 
sequences satisfy both the latent cancer QHO and the early fatality QHO.
 The summation of the risk from all the PRA sequences is carried out using  the 
mean value of each sequence dose and frequencies.
 Meeting the F-C curve imposes additional constraints in addition to satisfying the 
QHOs because specific dose limits are imposed at all frequencies.
 Both the individual risk of each new reactor and the integrated risk from all of the 
new reactors at one site, associated with  a future combined license application, 
should not exceed the risk expressed by the QHOs.
 It is not required that the integrated risk from existing reactors, where there are 
multiple reactors at a single site, meet the risk expressed by the QHOs, even though 
the site may be considered for new reactors.</text>

Insights
Data appropriate for gas reactors are needed.
PRA insights were used to 
change the configuration of the  design (Designs 5 and 6) 
add a secondary onsite power source (Designs 7 and 8)
add a nitrogen accumulator system (Design 9)
Several designs satisfied the probabilistic goals but not the deterministic criteria.  Are 
the latter unnecessary regulatory burden?
Design 8 (3x100% loops; microturbine; elimin ation of the failure-to-start mode for an 
onsite AC power supply) is be st in terms of CDF (7.58x10-8ry-1).
Mircoturbines have never been used in a NPP emergency powe r supply system.  As such, 
they will be thoroughly scrutinized during the licensing process.  Data are needed.
Adding redundant ECCS loops beyond 2x100% cap ability does not result in significant 
improvement (Designs 1-8).  This is due to the insensitivity of the CCF models.
No quantitative guidance exists as to how the values of the beta factor change when the design 
changes.
Causes: hardware (48.3%), maintenance (26.1%), operations ( 14.1%), environment (11.5%). 
Deliberation allows

LBE Selection using PRA
1. Drop all PRA sequences with point estimate frequency &lt; 1.E-8/yr.
2. For sequences with point estimate frequen cies equal to or greater than 1E-8, 
determine the mean and 95th percentile frequency.
3. Identify all PRA event sequences with a 95th percentile frequency &gt; 1E-7 per 
year.
4. Group the PRA event sequences with a 95t h percentile frequency &gt; 1E-7 per year 
into event classes (similar initiating events and similar accident behavior in terms 
of system failures and/or phenomena; similar source terms).
5. Select an event sequence from the event class that represents the bounding 
consequence.
6. Establish the LBEs frequency for a given event class.  The frequency of an event 
class is determined by setting the LBEs mean frequency to the highest mean frequency of the event sequences in the event class and its 95th percentile 
frequency to the highest 95th percentile frequency of the event sequences in the 
event class.
7. Verify that each LBE meets the acceptance criteria.</text>

Criteria and Goals
Deterministic Criterion (General Design Criterion 35)
An ECCS must be designed to wi thstand the following postulated 
LOCA: A double-ended break of the largest reactor coolant line, 
the concurrent loss of offsite pow er, and a single failure* of an 
active ECCS component in  the worst possible place.
*Common-cause failures are not considered single failures.
Probabilistic Goal
fLOCA = 5.45x10-4per reactor year infrequent initiator 
9Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) 10-2
AND
9fLOCA x CCDP 10% of the CDF goal of 10-4per 
reactor year = 10-5
CCDP 10-2is the only goal in this case</text>

Deterministic Criteria for LBEs
 In the frequent range:
no impact on the safety analysis assumptions occurs
no barrier failure occurs
redundant means of reactor shutdown remain functional
redundant means of decay heat  removal remain functional
the cumulative dose meets the 5 mrem dose specification of Appendix I of 10 CFR 50
 In the infrequent range:
a coolable geometry is maintained
at least one barrier remains
at least one means of reactor shutdown remains functional
at least one means of decay heat removal remains functional
9the cumulative dose of LBEs with fr equencies greater than or equal to 1E-3 per year, has to meet 
the 100 mrem specification of 10 CFR Part 20.   
9for LBEs with frequencies less th an 1E-3 per year the worst (m aximum based on meteorological 
conditions) two hour dose at the EAB (exc lusion area boundary) meets the F-C curve
 For the rare range, no additional deterministic (DiD) criteria apply.

 Event sequences that must be considered  in the safety analysis of the plant 
and must meet some deterministic cr iteria in addition to meeting the 
frequency-consequence curve.
 Purpose:
to provide assurance that the design meets the design criteria for various 
accident challenges with adequate defense-in-depth (including safety margin) to account for uncertainties, and
to evaluate the design from the standpoint of the dose guidelines in the sitingcriteria of 10 CFR Part 100.</text>

          <text>Special Treatment  Requirement s
	Requirements imposed on structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that go 
beyond industry-established requirements for commercial SSCs. 
	Safety-related SSCs are subject to special treatment, including quality 
assurance, testing, inspection, condition monitoring, assessment, evaluation 
and resolution of deviations. 
	Non-safety-related SSCs are not. 
	The categorization of SSCs as safety-related and non-
safety-related does not have a rational basis. 
	These requirements are very expensive. 
	The impact of special treatment on SSC performance is 
not known.

          <text>Comparison with Acceptance Guidelines
	The acceptance guidelines were established with the Commissions Safety 
Goals and subsidiary objectives in mind, and these goals were intended to be 
compared with mean values. Therefore, the mean values of the distributions 
should be used. 
	For the distributions generated in typical PRAs, the mean values typically 
corresponded to the region of the 70th to 80th percentiles, and coupled with a 
sensitivity analysis focused on the most important contributors to uncertainty, 
can be used for effective decision-making. 
	Approach:  Address parametric uncertainty and any explicit model 
uncertainties in the assessment of mean values; perform sensitivity studies to 
evaluate the impact of changes in key assumptions or the use of alternate 
models for the principal implicit m odel uncertainties; and use quantitative 
analyses or qualitative analyses as n ecessary to address incompleteness as 
appropriate to the decision and the acceptance guidelines.

	Risk-informing regulatory activities have 
enhanced and extended the traditional, 
deterministic, by: 
	Allowing consideration of a broader set of potential 
challenges to safety, 
	Providing a logical means for prioritizing these 
challenges based on risk significance, and 
	Allowing consideration of a broader set of resources to 
defend against these challenges

The ACRS Pragmatic Approach 
 Apply defense-in-depth (the structuralist approach) at a 
high level, e.g., the ROP cornerstones (e.g., IEs, Safety 
Functions). 
 Implement the rationalist approach at lower levels, except 
when PSA models are incomplete. Revert to the 
structuralist approach in these cases.</text>

We continue to be surprised 
 The NRC and DBNPS failed to adequately review, 
assess, and followup on relevant operating 
experience.  Recent events have shaken our confidence in our 
assumptions. 
 The NRC failed to integrate known or available 
information into its assessments of DBNPSs safety 
performance. 
[Davis Besse NPS Lessons-Learned Re port, US NRC, September 30, 2002]  DBNPS failed to assure that plant safety issues

ACRS Interpretations of DiD 
 Structuralist : DiD is embodied in the structure of 
regulations and in the design of the facilities built to
comply with those regulations. What if this barrier or 
safety feature fails? 
 Rationalist : DiD is the aggregate of provisions made to 
compensate for uncertainty in our knowledge of accident 
initiation and progression.

Defense In Depth (RG 1.174) 
 A reason able balance is preserved  among p revention of core damage, prevent ion of 
containment failure, and consequ ence mitigation. 
 Over-reliance on  programmatic activities to compensate for weaknesses in plant design 
is avoided. 
 System redundancy, independenc e, and diversity are preser ved commensurate with the 
expected  frequen cy, consequences of challe nges to the system, and u ncertainties (e.g., 
no risk outliers). 
 Defenses against common-cause failures ar e preserved, and  the potential for the 
introduct ion of new common-cause failure mechanisms is assessed. 
 Indepen dence of barriers is not degraded. 
 Defenses against human errors  are preserved. 
 The inte nt of the GDC in Appendix A to 10 CF R Part 50 is maintained.</text>

The Concerns 
 Arbitrary appeals to the structuralist interpretation of
defense-in-depth might diminish the benefits of risk-
informed regulation. 
 Strict implementation of risk-based regulation (the
rationalist interpretation of defense-in-depth) without
appropriate consideration of the structuralist defense-in-
depth could undermine the historical benefits.</text>

          <text>Department of Nuclea r Science and Engineering 6 
Uncertainties 
 Aleatory uncertainty is built into  the structure of the PRA model 
itself. 
 Epistemic uncertainties: 
 Parameter uncertainties are those associated with the values of the 
fundamental parameters of the PRA model, such as equipment failure 
rates, initiating event frequencies, a nd human error probabilities that are 
used in the quantification of the accident sequence frequencies. 
 In many cases, understanding of certain processes or phenomena is 
incomplete, and there may be different opinions on how the models should 
be formulated. Examples: modeling human performance, common cause 
failures, and reactor coolant pump seal behavior upon loss of seal cooling. 
This gives rise to model uncertainty . 
 Completeness is not in itself an uncertainty, but a reflection of scope 
limitations. The problem with completeness uncertainty is that, because it 
reflects an unanalyzed contribution, it is difficult (if not impossible) to 
estimate its magnitude. Examples: the analysis of some external events 
and the low power and shutdown modes of operation, and influences of 
organizational performance.</text>

 Characteristics of the options (E. Proust, CEA) 
 the two options do not provide the same 
overall services : recycling responds to more 
extended requirements than bare spent fuel 
management 
 for the power companies, the cost of R&amp;R is 
well established (commercial practice and

associated costs are forecasted with more

          <text>Fallacy of the Traditional Economic Resource Model*
Classical economic theory suggests that the price of non-renewable 
resources should rise over time, as the fixed available stock grows scarcer and 
more and more costly resources have to be used.218 Forecasters relying on this 
model have routinely predicted that th e uranium  price would im minently begin a 
steady rise as resources began to becom e scarce, and these forecasters have just as 
routinely been proved wrong. 
218For a usef ul discussion of the logical flaw s of this classical m odel  still am azingl y widely 
used, es peciall y in projections of  future uran ium prices  see M.A. Adelm an, M y Education 
in Mineral (Especia lly Oil) Econom ics, Annual Review of Energy and Environment, Vol. 
22, 1997, pp. 13-46. Another excellent critique of the standard model (drawing on examples 
related to uranium resources) is Thom as L. Neff, Are Energ y Resources Inexhaustible? 
presentation to the Gl obal Energ y Prospect s: Suppl y-Side Issues, London School of 
Econo mics and P olitical Science, N ovember 11, 19 85. Neffs basic answ er is close to  yes, 
and with respect to uranium , he concludes  we were not so much captiv e of natures limits 
as of  our own in thinking about uraniu m res erves and resources.

          <text>Profes sor Neil Todreas Problems with the BCG study
 Estimates unit cost of $620/kgHM for both reprocessing 
and MOX fab  much less than real plants have achieved 
for either process 
	Achieves this by: 
	Using low 3% government rate (OMB insist s on 7% for such 
projects) 
	Assumi ng large increase in capa city at m inor addi tional cost 
	Assumi ng never has an y contract or technical delays, so dramatic 
increase in throughput  unrealistic 
	Variety of other unrealistic assumptions 
	By contrast, real experience of using Areva technology in 
U.S. (SRS MOX plant) has resulted in costs m any times 
higher than in France  unmentioned by BCG

The impact of financing
Assume: Capital, operating costs = reported costs for 
THORP, (similar  to UP3), continuous operation for 30 
years at 800 tHM/yr. What is revenue requirement? 
 Government-financed (4% real): $1350/kgHM 
 Utility-financed: &gt;$2000/kgHM 
 Private venture financed: &gt;$3100/kgHM 
 Hence, achieving our $1000/kgHM illustrative figure 
would already require governm ent financing, dramatic 
technological im provement, or a com bination of both

Profes sor Neil Todreas Sustainability: uranium resources
	U resources recoverable at prices below those at which 
recycling would be justified are likely to be sufficient to 
fuel an expanding nuclear energy enterprise for many 
decades 
	Red Book estim ates of U resources rose significantly in 
last decade, even with little uranium exploration  more 
will be found now that high prices are motivating 
exploration 
	Current price run-up has nothing to do with lack of U in 
the ground, everything to do with constraints on rapidly 
bringing additional production on-line; but over time, 
profits to be made will mo tivate additional production 
	Reliance on recycling is not a path to energy security  as 
unforeseen events across the globe (or at home) can play 
havoc with a countrys  plutonium programs

From an electrochemical point of view all 
structural materials are composites.
Electrochemical differences can result in accelerated electrochemical reactions.
If these reactions occur environmentally assisted attack may be promoted.
In these situations both anodic and cathodicprocesses must be considered.</text>

Farmers Paper (1967)
 Iodine-131 is a major threat to health in a nuclear plant 
accident.
 Attempting to differentiate between credible (DBAs) and incredible accidents (Class 9; multiple protective system 
failures) is not logical.
 If one considers a fault, such as a loss-of-coolant accident 
(LOCA), one can determine various outcomes, from safe 
shutdown and cooldown, to consideration of delays and partial 
failures of shutdown or shutdown cooling with potential 
consequences of radioactivity release.</text>

Quantitative Safety Goals of the 
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(August, 1986)
 
 
Early and latent cancer mortality 
risks to an individual living near the 
plant should not exceed 0.1 percent of 
the background accident or cancer 
mortality risk, approximately             
5 x 10-7/year for early death  and         
2 x 10-6/year for death from cancer . 
 
  
The prompt fatality goal applies to an average individual living in the region between 
the site boundary and 1 mile beyond this boundary.
The latent cancer fatality g oal applies to an average i ndividual living in the region 
between the site boundary an d 10 miles beyond this boundary.</text>

Reactor Safety Study (WASH-1400; 1975)
Prior Beliefs:
1.    Protect against large LOCA.
2.    CDF is low (about once every 100 million years, 10-8 per reactor year) .
3.    Consequences of accidents would be disastrous.
Major Findings
1. Dominant contributors: Small LOCAs and Transients.
2. CDF higher than earlier believed (best estimate: 5x10-5, once 
every 20,000 years; upper bound: 3x10-4 per reactor year, once
every 3,333 years).
3.   Consequences significantly smaller.
4.   Support systems and operator actions very important.</text>

Risk Assessment Review Group
 We are unable to define whether the overall probability of a 
core melt given in  WASH-1400 is high or low, but we are certain 
that the error bands are understated. 
 
 WASH-1400 is "inscrutable." 
 
 "the fault -tree/event-tree meth odology is sound, and both can 
and should be more widely used by NRC." 
 
 "PSA methods should be used to deal with generic safety issues, 
to formulate new regulatory re quirements, to assess and 
revalidate existing regulatory req uirements, and to evaluate new 
designs."</text>

Large Early Release Frequency
LERF is being used as a surrogate for the early   
fatality QHO.  
It is defined as the frequency of those accidents 
leading to significant, unmitigated releases from   
containment in a time frame prior to effective  
evacuation of the close-in population  such that   
there is a potential for early health effects.  
Such accidents generally include unscrubbed   
releases associated with  early containment failure  
at or shortly after vessel breach, containment 
bypass events, and loss of containment isolation.</text>

Shutdown PRA Issues
Risk is dominated by operator actions - importance 
of HRA.
Generic studies give useful insights, but risk-controlling factors are plant-specific
.
Shutdown risk is dynamic - average risk is generally 
low (relative to full power risk), but is subject to risk spikes.
Shutdown risk is more amenable to management.
At-power risk is designed in.

Technological Risk Assessment
Study the system as an integrated socio-technical
system.
Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) supports Risk 
Management by answering the questions:
What can go wrong? (accident sequences or scenarios)
How likely are these scenarios?
What are their consequences?</text>

The Pre-PRA Era (prior to 1975)
Management of (unquantified at the time) uncertainty was always a 
concern.
Defense-in-depth and safety margins became embedded in the regulations.
Defense-in-Depth is an element of the NRCs safety philosophy that employs successive compensatory me asures to prevent accidents or
mitigate damage if a malfunction, a ccident, or naturally caused event 
occurs at a nuclear facility. [Commissions White Paper, February, 
1999]
Design Basis Accidents are postulated accidents that a nuclear facility 
must be designed and built to with stand without loss to the systems, 
structures, and components necessary to assure public health and
safety.</text>

PRA Policy Statement (1995)
The use of PRA should be increased to the extent supported by the 
state of the art and data and in a manner that complements the defense-in-depth philosophy.
PRA should be used to reduce unnecessary conservatisms associated with current regulatory requirements.</text>

LOOP FREQUENCY INSIGHTS
Overall LOOP frequency during critical operation has 
decreased over the years (from 0.12/ry to 0.036/ry)
Average LOOP duration has increased over the years:
Statistically significant increasing trend for 
19861996
Essentially constant over 19972004
24 LOOP events between 1997 and 2004; 19 during the 
summer period
No grid-related LOOP events between 1997 and 2002; 13 in 2003 and 2004
Decrease in plant-centered and switchyard-centered LOOP 
events; grid events are starting to dominate

PWR SYSTEM INSIGHTS
EDG
EDG start reliability much improved over past 10 years.
Failure-to-run rates lower than in most PRAs.
AFW
Industry average reliability consiste nt with or better than Station 
Blackout and ATWS rulemaking.
Wide variation in plant specific AFW reliability primarily due to 
configuration.
Failure of suction source identified as a contributor (not directly 
modeled in some PRAs).
HPI
Wide variation in plant specific HPI reliability due to configuration.
Various pump failures are the dominant failure contributor.

MLD Development
Begin with a top event that is an end state.
The top levels are typically functional.
Develop into lower levels of subsystem and component 
failures.
Stop when every level below the stopping level has the 
same consequence as the level above it.</text>

Dependencies
Some dependencies are modeled explicitly, e.g., fires, 
missiles, earthquakes.
After the explicit modeling, there is a class of causes of failure that are treated as a group.  They are called common-cause failures.

Human Performance
The operators must decide to perform feed &amp; bleed.
Water is fed into the reactor vessel by the high-
pressure system and is bled out through relief valves into the containment.  Very costly to clean up.
Must be initiated within about 30 minutes of losing secondary cooling (a thermal-hydraulic calculation).</text>

They have been found to be significant contributors to incidents.

Criteria for a CCF Event:
Two or more components fail or are degraded at the same plant 
and in the same system.
Component failures occur within a selected period of time such that success of the PRA mission would be uncertain.
Component failures result from a single shared cause and are 
linked by a coupling mechanism such that other components in thegroup are susceptible to the same cause and failure mode.
Equipment failures are not caused by the failure of equipment outside the established component boundary.COMMON-CAUSE FAILURE (CCF) EVENTS

INITIATING EVENTS INSIGHTS
Most initiating events have decreased in 
frequency over past 10 years.
Combined initiating event frequencies are 4 to 5 
times lower than values used in NUREG-1150 
and IPEs.
General transients constitute majority of initiating events; more severe challenges to plant 
safety systems are about one-quarter of events.

Reliability and Availability
Reliability : Probability of successful operation over a 
period (0, t).
Availability : Probability the item is working at time t.
Note :  
In industrial applications, the term reliability includes the 
probability that a safety system wi ll start successfully and operate 
for a period (0, t).
The term unavailability usually refers to maintenance.</text>

Comments on Importance Measures
 Importance measures are typically evaluated for individual SSCs, not groups.
 The various categories of risk significance are determined by defining 
threshold values for the importance measures.  For example, in some 
applications, a SSC is in the "high" risk-significant category when FV &gt; 0.005 
and RAW &gt; 2.0.
 Importance measures are strongly affected by the scope and quality of the 
PRA.  For example, incomplete assessments of risk contributions from low-
power and shutdown operations, fires, and human performance will distort the 
importance measures.</text>

Direct cycle  separate ULOHS and ULOF may not be possible  loss of heat sink (precooler) may lead  to loss of flow to prevent compressor surge or stall,

Why? 
 Leakage component is very small (neg ligible for some gases, such as He)
 Possibilities :
1. Use core and reflector materials th at exhibit an increase in absorption 
cross section/reduction in refl ection upon spectrum hardening
2. Use gas that has high scattering ma croscopic cross section to increase 
benefit of leakage effect

regulation of power to compensate for operator errors or 
equipment failures even if the scram fails .  Core designed such that it inherently achieves safe 
shutdown state without exceeding temperature limits that 
would lead to core or vessel damageThis must be achieved under the most restricting

Note that this is much stronger requirement than for

Loss of coolant is not credible in IFR since coolant 
under no pressure and if vessel fails, the coolant 
remains in guard vessel ( but it is an issue in GFR, 
hence it needs to be accommodated )
Inherent shutdown is determined by:

          <text>What is GNEP? 
This morning, I want to speak to you about one part of this 
initiative: our plans to expand the use of safe and clean 
nuclear power. Nuclear power generates large amounts of 
low-cost electricity without emitting air pollution or 
green house gases. 
.... my Administration hias atino'uhced a bold new proposal called the Global 
Nuclear Energy Partnership. Under this partnership, America will work with 
nations that have advanced civilian nuclear energy programs, such as 
France, Japan, and Russia. Together, we will develop and deploy 
innovative, advanced reactors and new methods to recycle spent nuclear 
fuel. This will allow us to produce more enemy. while dramatically reducinq 
the amount of nuclear waste and eliminating the nuclear byproducts that 
unstable regimes or terrorists could use to make weapons.

Coolant is high pressure (15 MPa), H2O liquid; 
Low boiling point, Good heat transferCoolant is high pressure (7-20 MPa), Gas: He, 
CO2; Mediocre heat transferCoolant is low pressure ( 0.5 MPa), Liquid 
metal: Na, Pb; High boiling point, 
Excellent heat transfer
Some fraction of cooling inventory remains 
after LOCA&gt;98% of coolant escapes in a complete 
depressurizationUse of guard vessel retains adequate liquid 
inventory in reactor vessel
Large liquid reflood reservoir is available; 
Boiling and heat of vaporization facilitate 
coolingLimited high pressure gas injection available; At 
low pressure only air available in large 
amountCan design for passive decay heat removal by 
natural convection to ambient air or water
Post-LOCA goal is timely reduction of 
containment pressure to reduce leakage
Reducing pressure after shutdown does not 
negatively impact coolabilityMaintaining high pressure facilitates long term 
cooling, especially via natural convection
Low pressure is always detrimental to heat 
transfer and transport; Cooling capability 
is proportional to pressure; Adequate natural convection only at several 
atmospheresSystem is low pressure
Refueling under water at 1 atm can rely on an 
effective passive heat sink; Visual observation possibleCooling during depressurized refueling is 
challenging; Refueling at high pressure 
creates more LOCA sequences; Visual 
observation possibleRefueling is at low pressure, but blind; Heat 
removal is assured
Benign reactor physics characteristics; Negative 
coolant void reactivity (in common with most thermal reactors)Small delayed neutron fraction and Doppler

(in common with all fast reactors); Fuel

The most widely accepted correla tion for estimating the critical velo city for a tube bundle is 
Connors equation: 
where Pettigrew suggested a P/D effect on Connors constant: 
The critical velocity is constant for a fixed geometry and, with the exception of small changes 
in coolant density, does not  depend on the power and fl ow conditions in the core. (3.23)

where yrmsis turbulence induced vibratio n from axial and cross flow, mtis total 
linear mass, and f1is fundamental frequency of fuel rod. 
The wear rate ratio is the constrained parameter, and the ratio of the cycle 
lengths is the design limit.  
If a new design has a shorter cycle length than the reference core, then it can 
safely accommodate a higher rate of wear.  
The wear rate limit, due to its dependence on cycle length, will depend on both 
the power and the fuel burnup.  The power, however, depends on the wear rate 
limit, and the burnup, when limited by fuel  performance constraints, depends on 
the power.(3.39)</text>

feasibility regions for Hydride
 Feasible region: 1.1 P/D1.2. In this region there are 
no limitations due to the reactivity coefficients, and 
the theoretical burnup can be achieved.
 Feasible region but with limited burnup: 
1.2&lt;P/D1.35. These geometries can safely reach 
only a fraction of the theoretical burnup.
 Non feasible region: P/D&gt;1.35. These geometries are

Reliability and Availability
Reliability : Probability of successful operation over a 
period (0, t).
Availability : Probability the item is working at time t.
Note :  
In industrial applications, the term reliability includes the 
probability that a safety system wi ll start successfully and operate 
for a period (0, t).
The term unavailability usually refers to maintenance.</text>

Comments on Importance Measures
 Importance measures are typically evaluated for individual SSCs, not groups.
 The various categories of risk significance are determined by defining 
threshold values for the importance measures.  For example, in some 
applications, a SSC is in the "high" risk-significant category when FV &gt; 0.005 
and RAW &gt; 2.0.
 Importance measures are strongly affected by the scope and quality of the 
PRA.  For example, incomplete assessments of risk contributions from low-
power and shutdown operations, fires, and human performance will distort the 
importance measures.</text>

1. New capacity pla nning flexibility
2. High content of repetitive factory 
fabrication with uni t standardization
3. Shorter construction period
4. Potential market much larger5. Reduced financial risk resulting in lower 
financing rates
6. Lower costs of first-of -a-kind engineering in 
multi-modular systems
More rapid return on investment from   
single module
Packaging flexibility1.   Reduction in  planning margin
2a) Increased factory fabrication2b) More replication3.   Reduced construction time4.   Better match to demand5.   Smaller front end investment
6.   Bulk ordering
Multiple units at a single site
Improved availability (fast and efficient 
repair/replacement of defective modules)
Faster progression along learning curve
Increased station lifetime (easier 
refurbishment)
Elimination of some en gineered safety systems 
and the downgrading (in terms of safety) of 
some other plant features

          <text>UniStar Nuclear Business Model 
The UniStar Nuclear Business Model provides a compelling investment 
opportunity. For a fleet of units with a leveraged overnight capital cost of 
$1,998/kw and a return on equity at risk of 15%, the following take reflects the 
approximate resulting bus bar cost structure:

Variable O&amp;M 
Fixed O&amp;M $6 
$1 
Nuclear Decommissioning Trust 
,, , .", ,,, , ,,, ,,,", .,., ,.,,,,, ." ,,,, .,...,,, $2 
$16 
Equity Return 
Note: 
1) Decommissioning trust contributions based on an assumed NRC minimum of $475 million for a single 
1,600MW unit in 2015. Real rate of trust arrets return (asset compounded rate of return less inflation 
rate) - 2.0%. 
2) Negative tax cost represents tax benefit. Tax losserlcredits fully monetized when incurred. 
3) Debt service levelired using cost of debt. Equity return and taxes levelired using cost of eauitv.

Professor Neil Todreas3Dealing with economists (cont.)
The poor nuclear construction/operation experience of the 20thcentury has 
stung them. Whereas
 engineers are typically willing to accept projected improvements 
which stem from new design/operation regimes,
 economists await demonstration of improved cost performance 
from first mover construction and operation experience.
Hence MIT base case values became:
Overnight cost $2000/kWe
O &amp; M cost* $  15/kWe-hr (includes fuel)
Construction period 5 years
Capacity factor 85%
Plant life 40 years
*MIT base O&amp;M case is 25% reduc tion of non-fuel costs from recent $ 18/kWe-hr average fleet performance.</text>

Cost investment reduction of FBRs is an important R&amp;D 
axis
Management cost of waste should be taken into account: 
- FBRs have the potential of managing all their waste, 
- LWRs may require a second stratum of dedicated reactors (ADS or 
critical burner reactors), the cost of which should be integrated in the 
production cost of LWRsComparaison of

Professor Neil Todreas24Economy of Scale
Economy of scale refers to the genera l proposition that bigger is cheaper per 
unit output. In quantitative terms:
where
Ci, Co= cost of size iand reference (o) units, respectively
Ki, Ko= size or rating of subject units
n = scale exponent, typically ~ 2/3
Thus if a 50 MWe power station costs 2000 $/kWe, a 1000 MWe unit would be 
predicated to cost:1

Professor Neil Todreas25Caveats Using Economy of Scale Projections
1) Learning curves apply to  replication of the same design, by the same work 
force, in the same setting (e.g., factory), all of  which are likely to change 
in the long run.
2) Larger size may lead to lower reliability (i.e., capacity factor) and 
therefore net unit cost of product ma y increase, i.e., there may well be 
dis-economies of scale.
3) Important factors such as material s resource depletion or technological 
innovation are not taken into  account in an explicit manner.
4) At some point, size increases may re quire switching to new materials  for 
example, to accommodate higher stre sses, in which case the economy-of 
scale relation has to be renormalized.
5) Shared costs of many units on a si ngle site are also important: e.g., 
multi-unit stations save considerably on administrative infrastructure costs.

          <text>Summary
 Nuclear plants are complex man-machines.
 NRC regulations do not ensure safety  they 
establish requirements which if met will help.
 The utility determines whether the plant is safe or 
not.
 The management of the utility is part of the 
plants safety system as are all the employees.
 Safety culture as set by senior management will 
determine the plants economic and safety 
success.</text>

          <text>Homework Assignment
 Review NRC Bulletin 2002-01 to identify the 
events that lead to the Davis Besse reactor 
vessel head degradation.
 Research the studies performed following the 
discovery of the degradation and provide a 
summary of the breakdowns by the utility, INPO 
and the NRC that could have avoided this 
situation.
 Prepare a short summary highlighting the 
failures of each organization.
 Provide a rough estimate of the cost to FENOC 
of this lapse in both lost revenue and cost.</text>
