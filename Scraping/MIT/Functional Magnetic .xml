          <text>10/22/08 HST.583 | Diffusion weighted imaging 21/33How high b-value?
 Increasing the b-value leads to:
+ Increased contrast b/w areas of higher and lower 
diffusivity in principle
 Decreased signal-to-noise ratio Less reliable 
estimation of diffusion measures in practice
 DTI: b ~ 1000 sec/mm2
 HARDI/DSI: b ~ 10,000 sec/mm2
 Data can be acquired at multiple b-values for trade-off
 Repeat acquisition and average to increase signal-to-
noise ratio</text>

          <text>10/22/08 HST.583 | Diffusion weighted imaging 19/33How many directions?
 Acquiring with more gradient directions leads to:
+ More reliable estimation of diffusion measures
 Increased imaging time Subject discomfort, 
more susceptible to artifacts due to motion, 
respiration, etc.
D T I :
 Six directions is the minimum
 Usually a few 10s of directions
 Diminishing returns after a certain number [Jones, 2004]

          <text>10/22/08 HST.583 | Diffusion weighted imaging 25/33Distortions: Eddy currents
Fast switching of diffusion-
encoding gradients induces eddy currents in conducting 
components
Eddy currents lead to residual 
gradients that shift the 
diffusion gradients
The shifts are direction-
dependent, i.e., different for 
each DW image
Results: Geometric distortions

          <text>5The Form of the Model
 
If your X matrix does not appropriately model the factors 
contributing to mean activation, then your estimates can 
be seriously biased. 
This bias can, in principle, be detected by looking at the 
residuals. 
Think of the example of a straight line t to data for which 
a parabola would be much better. 
How would the residuals (deviations from the t) tell you 
that your model is inappropriate?

Permute the labeling of high (cases) and low (controls) 
troponin and calculate voxel-wise t-statistics. 
Use AlphaSim to determine a suitable threshold and 
cluster constraint (threshold of 0.05, minimum cluster of 
43 voxels). 
Result: Patients with strokes in the right insula and right 
inferior parietal lobule tended to more frequently have 
high troponin than other stroke patients.

          <text>1Model Selection
 
In any course in regression analysis, one learns how to 
choose a best model from within a family of interesting 
candidate models. 
Part of this approach involves examining candidate 
models for goodness-of-t, mostly be examining residuals 
as discussed earlier. 
Another part of this approach is model comparison, which 
involves tting a large model, with perhaps too many 
parameters, and then comparing this t to a smaller 
model in which some of these parameters are 
constrained, either to equal zero, or else perhaps to equal 
each other.

          <text>1Two Approaches to Data Analysis
 
Fixed-Effects Analysis: Average data over subjects, look 
at p-values for contrast on average map. (Degrees of 
freedom number of time points in scan.) 
Random-Effects Analysis: Estimate contrast map for each 
subject. Use these maps as data for a second-level 
analysis. (Degrees of freedom number of subjects.)

          <text>6Error Variance Assumptions
 
Inappropriate modeling of temporal correlation can give 
you a biased estimate of the uncertainty in effects, and 
grossly incorrect estimates of degrees of freedom for 
voxel t-or F -statistics. 
In principle, one can test this by looking to see if the 
residuals at each time course are (at least approximately) 
white noise.

Ay, H. et al. (2006). Neuroanatomic correlates of

Hypothesis: 
A High level of troponin is a sensitive marker of heart 
damage. 
Heart damage could result from strokes in certain 
locations. 
Can we determine where these locations might be 
by comparing stroke patients with high troponin with 
matched low-troponin controls?

In addition to requiring that p values be below a threshold, 
one can impose as an additional requirement that there 
be a minimum number of voxels clustered at any active 
location. 
There are obviously many ways to pair critical p-values 
with minimum cluster sizes. 
There is a stand-alone C program, AlphaSim that can 
determine cluster signicance levels by simulation. 
AlphaSim is part of the AFNI distribution (Bob Cox, NIH, 
afni.nimh.nih.gov)

Calculation of posterior distribution of contrast is 
straightforward by numerical integration. 
Introducing subject-level covariates (e.g., age, treatment) 
is easy in principle, though simulation (Gibbs Sampler) 
will have to replace exact integration.

Stage 1: Obtain the a map of effects for each subject.
 
Stage 2: Use these effect maps as data in the second
 
stage of the analysis.
 
Form the t-statistic for an overall test of signicance of the
 
effect or contrast.
 
Note that these maps enter into the second stage on
 
equal footing.

          <text>0Separation of Signal from Noise
 
A necessary step in any fMRI analysis is to remove 
nuisance effects from the data. 
Usually these results are low-frequency trends, and they 
are removed either by high-pass ltering, or by explicit 
modeling via covariates in the GLM. 
Always keep in mind that if your have signal which looks 
like the trend being removed, then you might be throwing 
the baby out with the bathwater. 
One example might be a nuisance physiological effect, 
which youd like to model and remove. If this effect is, at 
least in part, associated with an experimental stimulus, 
then you could be discarding important signal with the 
noise.  p. 10</text>

yi = + xi + ei,

ei N(0, 102). To relate this to the previous 
parameterization, note that

(Aside: Note that the vectors [1, 1,..., 1]T and 
[x1,x2,...,xn]T not orthogonal! Consequently, the t-tests 
for and  will not be independent.)

          <text>9The Problem of Not Enough Subjects
 
Random-effects models include variability between 
subjects into the standard errors of estimates. 
If you only have a few subjects (e.g., 5 or so), then there 
is not much information in the data to estimate this 
variability! 
So your standard errors are large, and its much harder to 
establish signicance than it is with FE analyses. (Note 
the degrees of freedom of the t-statistics in our example: 
n(s 1) for FE; s 1 for RE. So the t-distribution is more 
diffuse, and the standard error has the extra b 2/s term.)

          <text>4Summary
 
The concept of a permutation test is extraordinarily powerful 
and useful. These tests are easy to understand, and, in 
principle, easy to apply. They are useful in situations where 
one wishes to employ a statistic with unknown distribution 
under the null hypothesis, or perhaps a well-known test 
statistic in situations where the assumptions for the usual 
null distribution are not satised.

          <text>7Fixed Effects Analyses
 
It is conceivable that one might want to make inference 
for only the subjects at hand, without any desire to 
extrapolate to a larger population. 
This might be the case for clinical applications of fMRI, for 
example, where the objective is to understand the 
subjects  patients  who are being studied or treated. 
Fixed effects models should be used in such cases. 
But since fMRI is presently a research tool, xed effects 
analyses are usually less appropriate than random effects 
analyses, in which one is concerned with inferences valid 
for a population, or equivalently, for the next subject 
which one might obtain.

The box formed by the two individual condence intervals 
is considerably smaller than the actual bivariate 
condence region. 
Each condence interval for a parameter has condence 
level 0.95, so the region formed by the intersection of 
these intervals has condence 0.952 =0.9025 &lt; 0.95.

In conjunction analysis, one attempts to nd what 
activation is statistically signicantly in all (or, perhaps, 
most) subjects. 
This feature can then be thought of as typical, i.e., more 
likely than not to be present in the population from which 
the subjects are drawn.

          <text>3A Regression Model
 
For representative voxels in each subject: 
log(yt)= 0 + half + type + 
half type + t 
where type is a 3-level factor for face type (Angry, 
Neutral, Fixation); half (levels 1 and 2) compares the 
rst and second half of the experiment, and t is (for 
simplicity) here modeled as white noise.

          <slideno>46</slideno>
          <text>6Illustrative Example (Contd)
 
A paired t-test with 81 = 7 degrees of freedom leads 
to the t-statistic 2.515. 
Comparing this value to the theoretical reference null 
distribution (T7), one determines a two-sided p-value of 
0.040. 
The t-test is quite robust to modest departures from 
assumptions, even for N =8, so using the T7 as a 
reference distribution for the p-value is probably OK. 
However, what if one did not want to make the 
assumptions necessary for the validity of this theoretical 
null distribution? 
(Note that for some complicated test statistics, or for 
very messy data, one often doesnt know a reasonable 
approximation to the null distribution.)

Assume that several machines are used in a production 
environment. To x ideas, lets say these machines are 
for DNA sequencing. 
If I have several of these machines in my lab, I would 
presumably be interested in quantifying the relative 
performance of each of them. Fixed effects models would 
be appropriate. 
On the other hand, if I owned the company that makes 
the machines, then Id want to characterize the 
performance of any one of the machines, conceptually 
drawn at random. The machines would then constitute a 
population, and Id use random effects analyses.

We next consider approaches to data analyses which 
involve more than one subject. 
The rst difculty that one has to address in these 
situations is warping each subjects data onto a common 
template, such as Talaraich coordinates. 
This process can easily introduce and difculties and 
distortions of its own, but these are beyond the scope of 
the present discussion.

          <text>1Summary: Gaussian Random Fields
 
GRF theory requires that we know the spatial correlation, 
at least approximately. 
In order to meet this requirement, we must do fairly hefty 
spatial smoothing (i.e., precoloring). 
This has the obvious disadvantage of blurring together 
brain structures with different functions, particularly if the 
smoothing is not done on the cortical surface. 
Compare with AlphaSim, another way for accounting for 
spatial correlation due to smoothing.

          <text>2Model Selection (Contd)
 
Model comparison thus reduces to hypothesis testing, in 
the simplest textbook situations, to F -tests. 
This approach can be applied to fMRI, although instead 
of a single F -test, we will have F maps and associated 
p-value maps to interpret. 
More general model comparison tool compare the 
reduction in residual sum of squares between nested 
models, penalizing for complexity due to adding 
parameters. Two such criteria are AIC and BIC (Akaike 
Information Criterion; Bayesian Information Criterion).

If one thresholds a continuous GRF, the the Euler 
Characteristic is 
EC = (# Blobs) (# Holes), 
if the threshold is sufciently high, then this will 
essentially become the (# Blobs). 
If the threshold is higher still, then the EC will likely be 
zero or 1. 
If we threshold high enough, then we might be able to 
assume, at an appropriate signicance level, that all blobs 
are due to activation.

          <text>4Habituation/Sensitiziation Contrast
 
For models of log of the data, contrasts become 
dimensionless ratios. (Only BOLD changes have real 
meaning.) 
The following contrast is useful for testing for 
sensitization/habituation: 
cS =exp[(A,2 N,2)(A,1 N,1) 
We also looked at 
cH =exp(N,2 N,1) 
Data from each subject are summarized by contrasts 
estimates and standard errors, which are used as input 
to a second-level Bayesian analysis.

          <text>7Error Variance Assumptions (Contd)
 
How does the temporal autocorrelation vary from voxel to 
voxel? Is it adequate to use the same model for each 
voxel? 
Assuming equal within-voxel variances when these 
variances differ considerably is also something that one 
might want to look out for, though checking the correlation 
estimates is probably more important.

          <text>9The Random-Effects Idea
 
A contrast at any given voxel is regarded as a sum of 
three components: 
1.	 The true (but unknown) contrast 
2.	 A random shift from the truth which depends only on 
the subject. 
3.	 A second random shift from the truth due to 
measurement uncertainty within a subject. 
In the limit of many subjects, (2) can be made arbitrarily 
small; in the limit of long scans, (3) can be made 
arbitrarily small (except perhaps for a measurement bias).

This robustness, unfortunately, does not extend to 
random effects. Estimates of variances between subjects, 
for example, will likely be sensitive to to the assumption of 
Gaussianity. That being said, Gaussian random-effects 
models are very widely used, because there are not good 
alternatives.

          <text>An Illustrative Example (Model)
 
In order to illustrate many of the basic ideas, it is sufcient 
to consider an example of condence intervals (or 
hypothesis tests) on just two parameters. 
Consider the simple linear regression model 
yi =  + (xi x)+ ei, 
where xi =0, 10, 20,..., 100,  =0,  =1, and the 
ei N(0, 102). 
(Aside: Note that the vectors [1, 1,..., 1]T and 
[x1 x,x 2 x,...,x  n x]T are orthogonal.)

Example: The Permutation Distribution 
The set of 16 numbers can be divided into 2 ordered 
pairs (rst, last) 518,918,400 ways  of which only 1 will 
correspond to the correct pairing. 
The basic idea of a permutation test is to randomly 
permute the labeling of the data (i.e., the assignment 
of values to pairs, and the ordering of these pairs) many 
times. 
For each labeling, a test statistic of interest is calculated 
(here a paired t-statistic). 
One then compares that statistic obtained from the 
correctly labeled data (here, T =2.515) with the 
empirical reference distribution of the same statistic 
calculated for many permuted labellings.

          <text>8Gaussian Errors
 
When doing inference, we assume that the noise in our 
data follows Gaussian distributions. 
(This assumption is necessary for determining standard 
errors of estimates; it is not required for the estimates 
themselves.) 
Fixed effects analysis are not very sensitive to violation of 
this assumption. The central limit theorem implies that 
averages tend to be Gaussian in many situations, and 
coefcient estimates are essentially weighted averages. 
Standardized contrasts will generally be approximately 
t-distributed (Central Limit Theorem; if standard errors 
and degrees of freedom are appropriately estimated).

          <text>The Rest of the Story . . .
 
The t-statistic on the previous slide was obtained by 
choosing the maximum of 646416 = 65, 536 random 
draws from the null distribution of the test statistic (i.e., 
the T50 distribution). 
So one might typically expect to see a t-statistic this large 
or larger in a typical fMRI volume, even if what youre 
imaging is a bottle of water. 
We need to adjust p-values for the number of tests 
performed, a process which statisticians call adjusting for 
multiple comparisons.

Assume 2 and normal contributions to the likelihood for 
the within-subject variances and contrast estimates, 
respectively. 
Model the betwen-subject effects as normally distributed 
with mean zero and unknown variance. 
Use non-informative prior distributions for within-subject 
standard deviations, contrast estimates, and usually (but 
not necessarily) for the between-subject standard 
deviation.

          <text>4Summary: Bonferroni
 
For an overall test at the  signicance level, select
 
individual voxels among N total as active if p /N.
 
Not a bad approximation if voxels are nearly independent.
 
Can be very conservative if there is considerable spatial 
correlation among voxels. 
Using both a p-value threshold and a minimum cluster 
size via AlphaSim is one way to partially overcome this 
conservatism.

Over repeated future data, the probability that either 
parameter falls in its interval is 1 =0.95. Since the 
model has been set up so the the estimates (, )are 
independent, the actual probability of rejecting H0 for the 
pair of condence intervals 
 = Pr( T1 t1 or T2 t2)= || || 
1(1)2 =1(10.05)2 =0.0975.

This is approach achieves exactly the desired

          <text>1Typicality
 
Friston, Holmes and Worsley (NeuroImage, 1-5, 1999) 
introduce the concepts of typicality and conjunction 
analysis as a way to make inference with respect to a 
population in a xed-effects context. 
If one has a small sample of subjects, and a certain 
feature is observed in several of these subjects (adjusting 
for multiple comparisons), then one can say, qualitatively, 
that this feature is typical, and thus likely to be present in 
a population. 
This is to be contrasted from quantitative assessment of 
what the average effect is in a randomly selected 
subject from a population.

One typical aspect of block designs (such as the angry 
faces study) is that subjects tend to habituate to the 
stimulus, with consequent decreased BOLD activation. 
An interesting aspect of the present data is that, in many 
regions subjects tended to have a stronger BOLD 
response in the second half as compared to the rst. This 
is called sensitization.

Maximum active clusters of 42 or more below threshold

Note the following: 
For a higher p-value threshold, the minimum
 
signicant cluster size will be larger.
 
This approach accounts for spatial correlation induced 
by smoothing, but not for and spatial correlation 
present in the unsmoothed data.

          <text>3Critique of Usual Two-Stage Approach
 
The usual two-stage approach to multi-subject analyses 
treats the contrast estimate maps from each subject as 
given data, without consideration of the uncertainty in 
these values, which may be considerable and which may 
differ from subject to subject. 
A better approach is two summarize a contrast of interest 
by two maps: a contrast estimate map, and a 
corresponding standard error map. This is the approach 
advocated by Worsley (NeuroImage (2002)), for example.

          <text>0Not Enough Subjects (Contd) 
Its important to realize that the large standard errors for
 
RE analyses with few subjects is usually not a fault of the
 
2metholdogy. Rather, one is incorporating 
b
 in the
 
standard errors of the estimates, and this is quantity 
which cant be well estimated except under two 
conditions: 
You have lots of subjects, and so 2
/s is reasonably
 b
small, and your t-test for effect signicance has 
adequate degrees of freedom. 
You regularize the estimate of 2
b
 by including
 
information which isnt in the data. This can be done 
explicitly, via a prior distributions and a Bayesian 
analysis, or implicitly, as in Worsley (2002).

The Bonferroni and GRF approaches ensure that the 
probability of incorrectly declaring any voxel active is 
small. If any voxels survive, one can reasonably expect 
that each one is truly active. 
An alternative approach is to keep the proportion of 
voxels incorrectly declared active small. Among those 
voxels declared active, a predetermined proportion (e.g., 
0.05), on average, will be declared active in error (false 
discoveries).

A Gaussian random eld is a stationary Gaussian
 
stochastic process, usually in 2 or 3 dimensions.
 
The one-dimensional case of GRF is Brownian motion 
(formally, a Weiner process). 
Unsmoothed BOLD activation is not well approximated as 
a GRF, so spatial smoothing is generally done if one is to 
use GRF theory. 
Smoothing is averaging, and averages of (almost) 
arbitrary random variables are approximately Gaussian. 
This is the essence of the Central Limit Theorem.

Data: For 50 consecutive stroke patients with high

voxels are infarcted in each stroke lesion. 
We could compare these with voxel-wise t-tests, except 
that the masks are very non-Gaussian.

          <text>3IV. Model Validation
 
The GLM is a very powerful tool, but like any modeling 
tool, it is only good to the extent that the modeling 
assumptions are valid. 
If assumptions are grossly violated, then inferences can 
be seriously misleading.

          <text>2Summary: False Discovery Rate
 
Can be more sensitive at detecting true activation than 
Bonferroni without requiring the heavy spatial smoothing 
of GRF theory. 
But a change in philosophy is required: instead of making 
the likelihood of any voxel being falsely declared active 
small, one is willing to accept that a small proportion of 
voxels will likely be false discoveries, and instead attempt 
to control the size of this proportion.

          <text>Noise modeling: 
Noise Sources: 
  1. Thermal (white) = 50% in CtxGM, 90+% in WM. (3T, unsmoothed) 
  2. Physio (correlated) 
      - Motion - partial voluming, spin history 
      - Respiration  
      - Heart beat 
      - "Resting State Networks" 
  3. Scanner-related (white) 
When Sn != I 
Autocorrelation - can predict noise at one tp given previous better 
  than chance (not necessarily deterministic). 
Tend to be low freq: respiration, heart beat (aliasing), motion, other physio. 
Why should you care: 
  1. Invalidates t and F (tends to make too liberal) 
  2. Less efficient than white. 
Autocorrelation plot of residual 
Time invariant - model as an ACF, generate Sn from ACF 
Estimate of ACF from residuals (biased) 
W = inv(chol(Sn)) 
New model (generalized least squares): W*y = W*X*beta 
"Fully efficient" 
Without pre-whitening: cov(gamhat) = C*inv(X'*X)*X'*Sn*X*inv(X'*X)*C' 
With pre-whitening:    cov(gamhat) = C*inv(X2'*X2)*C'

Efficiency and Optimal design 
Deconvolution, overlap, simultaneous equations.

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Experiment with 3 identical stimulus presentations (Nrep=3). 
Stimulus schedule - far enough apart for no overlap (FIER) 
Results in 3 identical HRFs. 
Noise added. 
Sampled at TR. 
Ntp = number of time points/TRs over experiment. 
This is the "Observable" (y). 
From this we want to compute the hemodynamic response amplitude 
and quantify the uncertainty. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Non-Matrix Formulation: 
Construct Post-stimulus delay (PSD) Window (aka Peristimulus) 
One bin for each TR in the window 
Number of bins = Window/TR (Nbeta) 
Each bin corresponds to 3 measurements 
For each bin compute: selective sum, count/Nrep, average 
Plot the averages (betahat, betas, parameter estimates) 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Compute signal estimate (yhat) (resynth) 
Compute residual r = y-yhat 
SumSquareError = SSE = sum(r^2) 
DOF = Ntp - Nbeta 
Residual variance = rvar = SSE/DOF = MeanSquareError (MSE) 
Residual stddev = sqrt(rvar) = RootMeanSquareError (RMSE) 
LMSE = LeastMeanSquareError Estimator 
StandardVariance = rvar/Nrep 
StandardError = sqrt(rvar/Nrep) = sqrt(StandardVariance) 
t = Average/StandardError 
Adequate analysis, but not very flexible (eg, how to add more 
  conditions, overlay, nuisance variables, etc, ?). 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Matrix Formulation: y = X*beta 
y = observable (Ntp-by-1) 
X = design matrix (Ntp-by-Nbeta) 
beta = true parameters/weights (cf betahat vs beta) (Nbeta-by-1) 
row = time point 
First col of X = 1 where stim are presented, 0 else 
Second col = First shifted down one row. 
Third col = ... 
One col for each delay = Nbeta 
cols = post stimulus delay 
col vector = regressor 
Set of linear equations: Ntp knowns, Nbeta unknowns 
Must have: Ntp &gt; Nbeta (overdetermined) 
Solve = Fit = Estimate: betahat = inv(X'*X)*X'*y (cf betahat vs beta) 
betahat = regression coefficient, parameter estimate, average 
Pseudoinverse: inv(X'*X)*X' = X+ (for non-square matrices) 
Selective Sum = X'*y 
Count = X'*X (strictly only true for FIER) HST.583: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Data Acquisition and Analysis, Fall 2008

    (HM-NM) - (HF-NF) = HM - HF - NM +NF : Cb = [+1  0 -1 -1  0 +1] 
       C = [+1 -1  0 -1 +1  0] 
           [+1  0 -1 -1  0 +1] 
Nuisance - set weights to 0. 
 
Four conditions: C1 C2 C3 C4. Estimate each one separately and test 
(C1+C2) - (C3+C4) vs combining C1/C2 and C3/C4 into two regressors (A 
and B) and testing A-B. 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hypothesis testing and the quantification of uncertainty and risk 
Null hypothesis (H0): nothing is happening 
The H0 can be  
  1. True (there is truly NOTHING happening) 
  2. False (there is truly SOMETHING happening) 
We can make the following decisions base on our analysis: 
  1. Reject H0 (postive) (there's not nothing happening)  
  2. Fail to Reject (negative) (not necessarily accepting H0)  
This leads to four possible results (2x2): 
           H0True  H0False 
  Reject     FP      TP 
  Fail       TN      FN 
Two types of errors: 
  Type  I: False Positive (FP) (alpha, FPR, selectivity; TPR=1-FPR) 
  Type II: False Negative (FN) (beta,  FNR, sensitivity; TNR=1-FNR) 
Power analysis/ROC is (1-beta) vs alpha = TPR vs FPR 
 
Rate = frequency that we would make a certain decision if we did the 
same experiment over and over again without changes to the signal, 
design, or noise ("frequentists"). 
 
Hard to quantity FNR - need actual TPR. 
Can quantify FPR (assuming the model is correct). 
 
Protect yourself against false positives by choosing a threshold 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Parametric Statistics and the Linear Model 
gamma = C*beta 
gammahat = C*betahat 
 
Under H0: beta = 0, y = X*beta+n = n, so  
  betahat = inv(X'*X)*X'*n 
  gammahat = C*betahat = C*inv(X'*X)*X'*n 
Could determine distribution emperically from rest scans 
 
E(gammahat) = gamma 
cov(gammahat) = rvar * C*inv(X'*X)*C'  (StandardVar/Err) 
gammahat ~N(gamma, cov(gammahat))

beta = true beta (unknown) 
n = noise, unknown, ~N(0,nvar*Sn),  
  nvar=true variance (unknown)  
  Sn = true temporal covariance matrix (unknown) (=I for white noise) 
HDR Model (FIR):

  anything sampled at TR within the window 
Parameters: beta, nvar, Sn, PSDMax 
Properties: 
  betahat = inv(X'*X)*X'*y 
  E(betahat) = beta (unbiased) 
  E(rvar) = nvar (unbiased) 
  Cov(betahat) = rvar * inv(X'*X) (error bars) 
Generally true regardless of X, y, beta, etc. 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Assuming a shape to the HDR: 
Gamma function: h(psd) = beta * ((psd-D)/tau)^2 * exp((psd-D)/tau) 
Sampled within the window (zero outside and less than D) 
Three parameters: 
  beta = amplitude (linear, unknown) 
  D = delay (nonlinear, assumed, eg 2.25 sec) 
  tau = dispersion (nonlinear, assumed, eg, 1.25 sec) 
Draw plots showing different taus and betas 
Assume values for nonlinear parameters, but estimate/fit linear parameters 
Draw observable 
Draw signal estimate for different betas 
Draw residual for different betas (SSE) 
Draw SSE as a function of beta

2006.05.02 (A. Kolasny) 
The 101 subject lddmm processing has been completed. This required 244,824 
cpu/hrs of processing and 40TB of storage. 
SDSC and NCSA TeraGrid sites, BIRN SDSC cluster and JHU CIS cluster 
were used for processing the 40,804 lddmm jobs . We will now begin the 
statistical analysis and vi sualization processing. 
2006.03.14 (A. Kolasny) 
Added an additional 10TB of storage to the JHU CIS storage repository. This 
used to complete the right hippocampus processing. Experimenting with 
sshfs and unionfs to assist in cluster processing. 
2006.02.10 (A. Kolasny) 
Completed lddmm processing for the 101 left hippocampus data sets. This 
computation required a total of 13 cpu/years of computing. We utilized the 
JHU CIS cluster, SDSC BIRN Cluster and TeraGrid for the processing. The 
processing required 20TB of storage which is being stored on the BIRN rack 
and the TeraGrid /gpfs-wan storage repository. Started processing the right

 The establishment of reliable biomarkers 
necessitates understanding and 
overcoming sources of variability due to 
subject and site.
 Access to a common set of acquisition 
protocols, processing and analysis tools, 
and data sharing infrastructure increase 
the chances of success.</text>

with minor artifacts, this is not usually true of 
automated processing pipelines.
Therefore:
1.use larger fields-of view and many slices
2.no parallel imaging

Several studies by Jack et al. (1998, 2000, 2004) of older 
sporadic AD cases (mean ages 7479 years in the different 
studies) have reported annua lized rates of hippocampal
atrophy of 34% with age-matched controls (mean ages 77
80 years) having rates of atrophy of 1.41.7% per year and 
similarly aged MCI subjects have intermediate rates at 1.8
3.7% per year.

 Biomarkers
- must have a scientific basis
- a change in the marker must reflect a 
change in disease progression
- be measurable and reproducible
Non-cognitive biomarkers are often used 
because cognitive measures often do not

modifications.</text>

 Acknowledge the variability across the 
different levels of anatomy. 
 Inter-subject correspondence doesnt have to 
be based on macro-anatomy. 
 DTI-based registration, fMRI based registration ... 
 Even if we had a perfect method for structural 
alignment, our fMRI data would not be in 
perfect alignment due to the variability 
between structure and function.

 Alignment measure: 
 Based on landmarks (Talairach and Tournox) 
 Based on image features (e.g. intensities, attribute vectors) 
 Intensity-based measures are usually naive: 
 E.g. sum of squared differences between image intensity 
values. 
 We know they are optimized at good alignment  but 
the solution is non-unique. 
 Regularization is typically achieved via warps!

 Dont forget that registration warps your data, so 
results based on geometric properties (e.g. size, 
shape) should be interpreted delicately

 What is spatial correspondence across 
subjects? 
 Historically in MRI it is based on macro-

 No ground truth: so how to validate? 
 To asses the optimizer: 
 Compute average across population and 
quantify sharpness 
 Compare the value of an objective alignment 
measure, e.g., mutual information 
 To asses the algorithm: 
 Measure overlap/alignment of ROIs (e.g. sulci 
regions, tissue maps, etc.)

Basic Idea of PCA 
Rotation of coordinates. First, nd direction of greatest
variability in the multidimensional cloud of data points.
Now iterate: let i+1st axis in rotated system be the
direction of greatest variability orthogonal to all i
previously determined directions.
If X is the column-centered case-by-variables data
matrix, then the rotation matrix is the (orthogonal)
matrix of eigenvectors of XT X. This is usually called
the loadings matrix.
The principal components (PCs, also called scores) are 
the coordinates of the data points with respect to the 
new coordinate system. 
The PCs are uncorrelated, with variances equal to the 
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (i.e., XT X/(n1)).

FX,Y was rst dened by Gelfand and Yaglom (1959) as 
the measure of information between X and Y. 
Geweke (1982) decomposed FX,Y into a sum of three 
measures of linear feedback: 
FXY + FY X + FXY = 
log(3/4)+log(1/2)+log(2/3)= 
log |3||1||2| = |4||2||3|
log(|1|/|4|)= FX,Y

          <text>8Why do PCA?
The rst few components often account for most of the 
variability. We can keep only the components with 
large variances, that is, PCA can be used for 
dimension reduction. 
The loadings for at least some of the PCs might be 
interpretable, (e.g., rst PC above might correspond 
roughly to the size of the turtle shell, or the rst few 
eigenimages might correspond to neural networks 
which seem sensible given the experiment).

          <text>3ICA: Blind Source Separation
Imagine that there are n time-varying sources si(t). 
We cannot directly observe the si; instead we observe 
linear combinations 
xi(t)= ai1s1(t)+ai2s2(t)+... + ainsn(t),
or, in matrix form 
X = AS
(Note, by the way, that there is no error term above.) 
If the si(t)are independent at each t, then one can, in 
principle, determine the si uniquely up to a multiplicative 
constant.

NonGaussianity Criteria: Kurtosis 
Kurtosis is the fourth central moment. The fourth 
moment is equal to 3 for Gaussians, leas than 3 for 
densities which peak near the center (leptokurtic, 
sub-Gaussian), and greater than 3 for densities at near 
the center (platykurtic, super-Gaussian). 
Assume x and y have variance 1. Kurtosis is 
(x)= (xi x)4 3
i 
Kurtosis is additive: 
(c1x + c2y)= c14(x)+c24(y)
Kurtosis is computationally simple, but highly sensitive 
to outliers.

          <text>1Preprocessing
Since ICA does not make use of covariances, it makes 
sense computationally to rst center and pre-whiten the 
data. 
If this is done, then the mixing matrix A (analogous to 
the eigentimecourses in PCA) will be orthogonal. 
Thus, one might consider doing PCA rst, then 
whitening (and thus discarding the covariance 
information on which PCA is based), and following with 
ICA.

          <text>Association vs. Causality
Causality: Predictability according to a law or set of laws. 
Association: Occurring together, with or without a causal 
relation (If A and B are associated, then perhaps A 
causes B, B causes A, or maybe C drives both A and B.) 
Methods for causal inference are invariably dependent on 
model assumptions. 
denitive answers require a combination of various kinds 
of evidence.

Spatial-Temporal Duality, Continued 
Thus the loadings of the eigenimages of the spatial 
covariance matrix XT X are proportional to the scores 
for the dual analysis with time points as variables, and 
vice versa. 
Since n&lt;&lt;p, it is computationally far more efcient to
compute the eigenvectors of the nn matrix XXT . We
 
can then use the duality to easily get the p-dimensional 
eigenvectors of XT X.

          <text>3ICA vs PCA
PCA and ICA are formally very similar: both produce a 
sequence of images and associated timecourses. 
PCA was developed for multivariate Gaussian data, for 
which uncorrelatedness implies independence. 
There is a natural ordering of principal components, 
based on the eigenvalues of the covariance or correlation 
matrix. 
PCA is often used to hopefully reduce the dimensionality 
of the problem, but replacing a high-dimensional dataset 
with a smaller number of orthogonal principal 
components.

Decomposition of Variance
Let x2 
i be the variance of xi, the ith row of X, i.e., the 
variance of image at the ith time point. Then 
n n 
x2 
i = i = tr (XXT ) 
i=1 i=1 
So the variance is preserved by the PCA. 
Hence, the normalized eigenvalues 
k
k  ii
can be interpreted as the proportion of variance 
attributable to the kth PCA.

How Many PCs: Common Approaches
Plot the eigenvalues in decreasing order (a scree plot, 
and look for a break (knee), with the eigenvalues to 
the right of the knee being very small. 
Retain eigenvalues greater than the average. (Recall 
that the eigenvalues are the variances of the PCs). 
Formally test for the smallest eigenvalue equal to zero, 
then the last two eigenvalues equal to zero, etc., until 
the null hypothesis is rejected. This tends to retain more 
components than other approaches, in part because 
the tests are not independent.

          <text>5PCA on Correlations
In addition to centering the columns of the data matrix, 
one can also scale these columns to have unit variance, 
prior to performing the PCA. 
This is equivalent to doing PCA on the correlation 
matrix, rather than the covariance matrix. 
It is often desirable to perform PCA on correlations 
rather than covariances, and it is nearly essential to do 
so when some of the variables are on different scales.

There is an extensive literature on this topic. 
Andersen et al. reference W.G. Mallows, Latent vectors 
of random symmetric matrices, Biometrika, 48, 
133-149, 1960. 
In practice, one often empirically keeps a few 
eigenimages, such that a reasonably large proportion of 
the variance is explained, and for which the networks 
indicated by the images have reasonable 
interpretations. 
Replication over subjects is more convincing than any 
formal statistical test, since the tests are asymptotically 
valid, and even then only when the Gaussian 
assumption is satised.

          <text>7How PCA in fMRI is Different
Usual PCA scenario: Rows of Xnp are a sample of 
size n of a p-variate Gaussian. 
In fMRI, Xnp is a matrix of time space, hence a 
sample of size one from a np-dimensional Gaussian. 
(Actually, one can also cast the X matrix for typical 
non-fMRI PCAs in this form, but the covariance matrix 
will be block diagonal with the pp covariance matrix of 
the column variables repeated n times on the diagonal, 
because of the independent cases).

          <text>2Probabilistic ICA (MELODIC)
In order to avoid overtting, and also to be able to

to extend the IC model to include noise.
One approach is implemented in the FSL package
MELODIC (Beckmann and Smith)
The MELODIC model (i indexes voxels):
xi = Asi + + i 
xi is p1, A is pq, where q&lt;p,  is the mean, 
i N(0,2i).

          <text>0 Correlation
If one plots observations of two random variables in a 
2D scatterplot, then correlation measures the extent to 
which these points fall along a straight line. 
If X and Y are random variables, with expected values 
E(X)and E(Y), then the correlation  is dened as 
E[(X E(X))(Y E(Y))]
 =   
E(X E(X))2 E(Y E(Y))2 
The sample form of this equation is

Granger Causality: Simulated Example 
Multivariate autoregressive model (here, two series): 
(1) (1) (2) Xt =0.8Xt1 +0.5Xt1 + t 
X(2) =0.8X(2) 
t t1 + t 
Noise term is white, with unit variances. 
Granger causality is dened to be the log of the ratio of the
prediction variance involving the past of only one series,
to the corresponding variance using past of both series.
We follow convention and refer to this as causality;
Granger himself later suggested that temporally related
would have been a better term.

Statistical Inference
For the rst time, we now use the Gaussian assumption 
of our data model, and not just the covariance matrices. 
We distinguish between estimates (e.g., k) and their 
corresponding population values. 
Var (k)22/(p1) k
Var (uk) k j 
2 ukukT 
p1 
j=1 (k j )
j= k 
Asymptotically valid for large n and p. Substitute 
estimates for population values. 
Var (wk)is of the same form as above, with obvious 
changes.  p. 2</text>

          <text>3 Decomposition of X
Finally, we can use the SVD (interpreted via PCA) to
express the space-time matrix X as a sum of pn n

rank-one matrices, each determined by a spatial 
eigenimage wi and a temporal eigenvector ui, weighted 
by decreasing eigenvalues i: 
n 
TX = 
iuiwi 
i=1 
Each term is the outer product of an eigenimage with a 
univariate timecourse. One can hope that the rst few 
eigenimages are interpretable, and that they explain 
most of the variability in X.

          <text>4ICA vs PCA (Continued)
ICA fails for Gaussian data. It is an attempt to nd 
independent non-Gaussian components. (In practice, 
one rst centers and whitens the data, so that the data 
are uncorrelated from the beginning.) 
There is no natural ordering of independent 
components, so no natural way to reduce 
dimensionality. 
The PCA algorithm is essentially unique, based on the 
singular value decomposition. 
ICA is algorithm-dependent. And even repeated runs 
using the same algorithm can give different answers, 
since there are random choices made in the 
optimization algorithm (e.g., random starting vectors).

          <text>8The Basic Idea of ICA
A linear combination of the xis is necessarily also a 
linear combination of the sis: 
y = w T x = w T (As)z T s
We want to nd a vector z for which y is as 
non-Gaussian as possible. 
There are 2n local solutions, equal to si(t), for 
i =1,...,n. 
If two or more of the si are Gaussian, then the sources 
cannot be found, since any linear combination of 
Gaussians is also Gaussian.

veins are labeled in FAIR Only arteries
Large # of slices cuts into # slices doesnt limit label time
labeling slab volume
Label efficiency not velocity Lower efficiency (15-25%) due to
sensitive Laminar flow.

If O2 consumption rises only modestly (15%), why 
does flow need to go up a lot (50%)?
Uncoupling between flow and metabolism?
No real paradox: as flow oxygen extraction is 
hampered by decreased capillary transit time.  
The simple answer is it takes a lot of flow increase
