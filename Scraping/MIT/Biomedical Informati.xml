Reading and Homework
Read the primary papers for each session before
the session.
Use the secondary papers and any other material you 
can find to expand you understanding and answer 
homework.
All homework is due at the beginning of the 
assigned class.  We take no prisoners. Primarily 
electronic submission.
Tutorials can be run from your own computers.

Original work
There are three forms of student creativity that are 
recorded in this class.  First, each student must show 
mastery of the materials in the homework problems. 
Second, we have tutorials in which each student should achieve a high level of competence.  We do not test this formally except to observe the ability of each student to perform the stated exercise.  Third, we have individual 
projects.  You must make sure that your original work and 
creativity are apparent in the final presentation.  Just 
reading from a review article is far short of our standard.  In all three cases, If a student consults with others or uses published materials, this must be recorded and fairly described.  Plagiarism will not be tolerated.</text>

Review of database technology
History
What is their role?
What do they do well?
What do they do poorly?
Ontologies
Why are they desirable?
What are their advantages?What are their weaknesses?

Review of relational database technology
Started in mid-80s
Composed of tables with rows and columns
Minimal language to construct and query them: 
SQL
Generally fixed and unchanged relationships
Java-based interface JDBC a real 
breakthrough; common interface for all 
flavors.  Can write programs!!!
Databases dont talk to each other

OWL  Web Ontology Language (3)
RDF Schema Features:

created by making one or more statements that a 
property is a subproperty of one or more other properties. For example, hasSibling may be stated to be a subproperty of hasRelative. From this a reasoner can 
deduce that if an individual is related to another by the 
hasSibling property, then it is also related to the other bythe hasRelative property.

OWL Ontologies
Describe meaning
OWL is a language (set of relationships) that 
can be extended with additional definitions
OWL is written in RDF, is machine-readable,    
and can be parsed and combined
Representing databases as ontologies
Can represent a database schema by an 
ontology
Will discuss state-of-the art programs to do the 
conversion
If we can convert, can have the best of both 
environments</text>

Why?
Overcome noisy PPI data as well as evolutionary variations
Gap
Occurs when a protein interaction in  one path skips over a protein in 
the other
Mismatch
Occurs when two proteins at the same position in the alignment do 
not share sequence homology
Neither gaps nor mismatches may occur consecutively

SMA5304: Biomedical Information Technology
Why proteins, protein interactions and groups of 
interactions are likely to have equivalent functions across species?
Based on these similarities, can we predict new functional information about proteins and interactions that are poorly characterized?
What do these relationships tell us about the evolution of proteins, networks and whole species?</text>

Consists of two paths one from each network ( N1 
and N2 )
Proteins in the first path pair with putative 
homologs occurring in the same order in the 
second path
A homologous protein pair may not occur more than 
once per pathway alignment
May include nonhomologous proteins

Comparison
Network alignment
process of globally comparing two networks, identifying regions 
of similarity and dissimilarity
Network integration
process of combining several networks, encompassing interactions of different types over the same set of elements, to study their interrelations.
Network querying
a given network is searched for subnetworks that are similar to 
a subnetwork query of interest

Nuclear medicine imaging technique
Patients given injection of very  small amount of tracer (e.g. fluorine 18  radio active version 
of glucose. Can be used to image brain where glucose is  the main source of energy)
PET scanner used to detect emis sion from the injected tracer
2D and 3D images of the scanned area is created by the computer
Can be used for:
Early detection and monitoring of cancer
Can reveal changes in metabolism and how organs and tissues are working
Can show if (and where) cancer is spreading to other parts of the body
Neurological disease
Can provide biochemical functi on information of the brain
Assessment of cardiovascular disease
Can be used to assess blo od flow to the heart and how the heart is functioning
Limitations:
Can give false results if  chemical balances with in body are not normal.
Resolution of structure s of the body may not be as clear  compared with CT and MRI scans 
although information gained fr om PET scan is much more.PET image of human brainPET image of human brain

Image Data - CT scan
Diagnostic procedure that takes a detailed cross-sectional x-ray picture of a 
"slice" of the body 
X-ray machine rotates around the patien t and takes pictures from many angles
Computer combines the pict ures into a very detail ed cross-sectional image 
Show the shape, size and the exact location of organs and tissues in any "slice" of the body 
Good spatial resolution
Able to distinguish 2 struct ures which are very near each  other as separate entities
Image size of CT scans depend on:
Number of slices
Resolution of scanner
Area scanned 
Other important information:
Device type

Questions Medical Data Can Answer
What is the patients medical history?
What are the symptoms?
What are the examination findings?
What are the changes in symptoms and signs over time? 
Progression of chronic diseases
Provides information for prescribing treatment
What are the changes in physiological function over 
time?
What were previous treatment given?
What was the rationale for treatment?</text>

Technology
Image Data - MRI scan
Diagnostic procedure that us es magnetic/radio waves to affect the bodys atoms
Radio waves force nuclei (usually hydrogen  body  consists mainly of water) into different 
position
When they restore their position, radio waves are emitted
Scanner picks up signals and a computer uses the sign al to compose the image
Image formed is based on location  and strength of the signals
Used to visualize structur e and function of the body
Provides detailed images of body in any plane
Provides much greater contrast between soft tissues than CT scan
Useful for brain, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and cancer imaging
Contrast agents sometimes used to enhance appearance of  blood vessels, tum ors or inflammation.
Image size of MRI scans depend on:
Number of slices (for 3D reconstruction)
Resolution of scanner
Area scanned

The airplane analogy
Understand how an airplane work:
Observe how an airplane flying phenotype:
Take the plane apart into individual parts
Record the interaction maps
What is the missing information? Why it is difficult to 
construct an airplane operations manual from the description of the parts and their interaction maps?
Meso-scale studies: functional modules or steps that 
are small enough to be readily described by parts; and 
yet large enough to link with other modules to understand how the whole plane works: engine, steering, fuel, navigation systems etc.</text>
