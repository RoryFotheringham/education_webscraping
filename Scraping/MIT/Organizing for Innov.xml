The Nature of a Creative Idea
 A creative idea is very similar to another kind 
of idea..?
 Therefore it is not very viable at birth.
 It is easily squelched.
 The originator very often has not developed 
sufficient faith in the idea.
 A group, therefore, can be a hostile 
environment to introduce a creative idea into.</text>

 There are boundaries inside the

difficulty (sometimes more) as the 
external boundary:

Two Conclusions
 There have been many studies in which groups and 
individuals are compared on their ability to produce 
creative ideas and they all agree on the following two conclusions:
1 .   Groups produce more creative 
ideas than individuals do.
 2.  Groups produce more creative 
ideas than individuals do.</text>

The Local Nature of Technology
 This implies that:
 Anyone outside of the organization cannot fully 
understand the way that those within the 
organization define technical problems without 
understanding the organization's culture.
 This difficulty in understanding the problem is the 
principal barrier to technology transfer.
 Barriers of this sort arise any time that we try to 
transfer knowledge across organizational 
boundaries.
 It thus holds true for internal communication as well 
as communication with other organizations.
 It is one of the causes of poor interfunctional 
relations in organizations.</text>

Personal Contact
 Most of the information came through 
personal contact.
 Where are the majority of these people?
 Inside or outside of the organization?</text>

Technology
 Technology is defined in terms of:
 The Business Goals
 The Marketing Strategy
 and most importantly,
 The Culture 
 of the organization in which it is developed.
 Technical problems are thus defined in terms 
of that culture and its system of values.</text>

 So far, no answers but three questions.
 Why dont those outside the organizations 
supply better ideas?
 Why arent those inside the organization 
consulted more?

 Does a similar effect influence

 If it does, that would argue in favor of 
geographic clustering.
 To test this, Ron Ozer determined the 
mean distance of each firm in the study 
from all of the other firms.
 He then related this measure to the 
amount of communication that scientists in each firm reported.</text>

 It thereby provides a better 
connection to those technologies and better ongoing technical support to the project effort.
 This is, however, accomplished

difficulty in coordination of the project tasks and less 
responsiveness to market 
change.Project Team Organization
 Project Team structure groups 
people from different disciplines 
together in a single team all 
reporting to a common manager.
 It thereby provides better 
coordination of the project tasks 
and increased sensitivity to 
market dynamics.
 This is, however, accomplished 
at the cost of a separation from 
the disciplinary knowledge 
underlying the project effort.  
When this is carried to an extreme, it will gradually erode the technology base of the organization.</text>

          <text>One Layer Lower
 If departmental organization enables 
closer contact with the technologies 
supporting a given development, are all 
technologies equal in the degree to 
which we must stay in close contact?
 If the answer is No, then what 
determines the degree of contact that 
we must maintain with different 
technologies?</text>

          <text>Time &amp; Coordination
 The biggest problem with departmental 
organization is the difficulty in 
coordinating the work across the 
different departments.
 But coordination is less necessary, 
given sufficient time.
 Some industries have managed to lessen 
coordination needs by extending 
development time.</text>

          <text>Organizing the Process
 There are many ways in which this process 
can be organized.
 However there are really only two basic structures 
that can be combined in many ways.
 Product Development managers have been very 
innovative in combining these two forms into very 
elaborate organizational structures.
 There has, however, been very little rational 
basis for choosing among these structures.</text>

          <text>Imbalance
 What is the problem when power, authority 
and credit drift to the project side of the 
product development matrix?
 Project managers are in a high pressure role.
 Pressure emanates from the Marketing function and 
from key customers.
 The competition already has their next generation out.  
Where is ours?
 This can tempt project managers into premature 
clearance of the product.</text>

          <text>The Basic Tradeoff and Dilemma in Product 
Development Organization
Departmental Organization
 Departmental structure is more 
closely mapped to the structure 
of the supporting technologies
 It thereby provides a better 
connection to those technologies and better ongoing technical support to the project effort.
 This is, however, accomplished 
at the cost of  much greater 
difficulty in coordination of the project tasks and less 
responsiveness to market 
change.</text>

Standard Industrial Practice
 Ignores the rate at which technologies 
are developing (despite the fact that 
this can often be measured).
 Usually ignores the interdependencies 
in project work (seasoned project managers are an exception).
 Focuses on project duration (and 
usually makes the wrong decision on this parameter).</text>

 It is the resolution of the two forces that

 Project management pulling the product

 Departmental management holding back.

 What is the problem when power, authority 
and credit drift to the project side of the 
product development matrix?
 Project managers are in a high pressure role.
 Pressure emanates from the Marketing function and 
from key customers.
 The competition already has their next generation out.  
Where is ours?
 This can tempt project managers into premature 
clearance of the product.</text>

          <text>Management of Transitions  IV
 Projects must be protected through 
transitions.
 There must be areas of continuity to offset the areas of change.
 Team size must grow in a gradual fashion.
 This has implications for both or ganizational structure and physical 
architecture.
 Both must be very flexible to a llow this to happen along with a gradual 
transition in reporting relationship.
 There should be an extra effort to retain a sense of ownership
among team members.
 Avoid runway management.</text>

          <text>The Inevitable Conflict
 Do not be surprised by the presence of 
conflict in the product development 
matrix.
 Conflict is designed into the matrix.
 Be worried when conflict is absent from 
the product development matrix.
 The absence of conflict means that one 
side won.
 The system is out of balance.</text>

          <text>Countering Imbalance
 There must be a countering force to 
constrain the project managers temptation 
toward premature release.
 Where better to find this force than in 
departmental management?
 Departmental management should be 
responsible for the technical integrity of the 
product.
 Of course, if the balance shifts too far toward 
departmental management, products may be 
delayed too long and time-to-market
extended too far.</text>

          <text>Management of Transitions
 The critical points of vulnerability in the life of 
a project are the points of transition.
 Transitions can involve ma ny parameters, for example:
 People
 Management
 Leadership &amp; leadership style.
 Primary organizational responsib ility and reporting relationships.
 Nature of the work.
 Types of knowledge required.
 Physical location.
 To change all of these simultaneously is to 
court disaster.</text>

          <text>Main Conclusion
 We must combine both organizational 
structure and physical structure 
(organizational location and physical 
location) to create the desired 
communication and support for innovative new product development.
 We must use both in a systemic manner, 
sometimes using one to offset the shortcomings 
of the other.
 Neglecting either will  lead to difficulties and 
detract from the optimal functioning of the 
innovation process.</text>

          <text>Communication Between Floors
 Vertical separation is disastrous for 
communication.
 We are captured psychologically by the 
floor that we are on.  That floor becomes 
for us the building.
 Visual contact can offset this effect.
