1. Primary Chemical Structure 
(Atomic &amp; Molecular: 0.1&#8211;1 nm) 
Length scale of bonding &#8211; strongly dictates biomaterial performance  
Primary 
&#8226; Ionic: e-donor, e-acceptor ceramics, glasses (inorganic) 
&#8226; Covalent: e-sharing glasses, polymers 
&#8226; Metallic: e-&#8220;gas&#8221; around lattice of + nuclei

         Structural Hi erarchy in Materials &amp; Biology 
What are &#8220;biomaterials&#8221;? 
A good working definition from the text is: &#8220;A nonviable material used in a 
medical device, intended to interact with biological systems .&#8221;* 
MEDICAL DEVICE EXAMPLES ANNUAL # (U.S.)* 
Sutures (temporary or bioresorbable) 250 M** 
Catheters (fluid transport tubes)    200 M 
Blood Bags       40 M 
Contact Lenses      30 M Intraocular Lenses      2.5 M 
Coronary Stents      1.2 M*** 
Knee and Hip Prostheses     0.5 M Breast Prostheses 
(cancer or cosmetic)   0.25 M 
Dental Implants      0.9 M Renal Dialyzers 
(patients)   0.3 M

facilitates open heart surgery) 
Vascular Grafts      0.3 M 
Pacemakers (pulse generators)     0 . 4 M 
Biomaterials are defined by their application , NOT chemical make-up

Lecture 9: 
Surface Modification of Biomaterials 
Purpose : alter surface properties to enhance performance in biological 
environment while retaining bulk properties of device 
Specific Objectives: 
1. clean a surface 
2. reduce/eliminate protein adsorption  
&#8226;	reduce undesirable/uncontrolle d responses to implants &amp; 
extracorpeal devices 
C3b/IgG adsorption &#8658; activation of WBCs 
&#8226;	reduce nonspecific adsorption  on biosensors &amp; bioassays 
Source: Wikipedia (Gray's Anatomy)(noise &amp; fouling) 
&#8226;	current strategy: hydrated, hydrophilic surfaces   
       PEO is current &#8220;gold standard&#8221; 
3. reduce/eliminate cell adhesion  
&#8226;	create surfaces that mimic nature&#8217;s cell resistant surfaces 
ex. Human serum albumin: naturally low affinity to 
      components of body fluids &amp; tissues ( consider its 
     high conc. in blood&#8212;60 wt% of proteins! ) </text>

6. promote cell attachment/adhesion 
&#8226; modify &#947;1 (vary chemistry &#8658; &#8593; protein adsorption) 
&#8226; create positive surface charge 
-many proteins  have net negative surface charge  
&#8658; &#8593; protein adsorption 
-cell glycocalyx  has neg. charge &#8658; nonspecific attraction 
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
NOTE: a strongly ++ surface 
can inhibit cell growth 
&#8226; increase surface rough ness/porosity    
-promotes cell attachment ( &#8593; surface area for binding) 
- can inhibit cell growth 
&#8226; bind cell adhesion ligands  to surface 
-	adhesion proteins (fibronectin)  
-	adhesion protein epitopes:  RGD (fibronectin, collagen&#8230;);

        ex. crosslinking (p assive) or pH &#8220;valves&#8221; (active)  
&#8593; pH 
8. increase lubricity ( &#8595; friction/wear) 
in vivo : hydrophilic surfaces 
9. increase hardness

4. reduce thromogenicity 
&#8226; hydrophilic surfaces
 - eliminate protein adsorption 
&#8226; hydrophobic surfaces
 - inherently weak surface/cell interface 
- exploits shear stre ss due to blood flow 
&#8226; surface-bound heparin 
- natural surface of endothelia l cells lining blood vessels 
- inactivates factor Xa &amp; thrombin by binding anti-thrombin 
&#8226; surface-bound albumin 
- no ligands for platelets (can attach if HSA denatures-how?) 
&#8226; albumin affinity coatings
 - surfaces that stro ngly adsorb albumin from blood to make a  
  passive coating;  ex. bilirubin K d ~ 10-8 l/mol 
&#8226; endothelial cell attachment
 -natural blood vessel lining &#8658; fibrinolytic activity

What Biocompatibility Testing is Required? 
Recommended tests depend on the  category of device 
I. Non-contact devices 
II. External contact devices 
A. Intact surfaces : contact with external body surfaces only 
e.g., electrodes, external prostheses, monitors
 B. Breached or compromised surfaces 
e.g., burn dressings, wound-h ealing devices, occlusive patches 
III. Externally communicating devices 
A. Intact natural channels
  e.g., contact lenses, urin ary catheters, colonoscopes 
B. Blood path, indirect : conduit for fluid entry to vasculature 
 e.g., solution and bl ood administration sets  
C. Blood path, direct: contact circulating blood 
  e.g., IV catheters, dialyzers and tubing, oxygena tors and tubing 
IV. Internal devices 
A. Bone   
e.g., orthopedic plates &amp; pins, bone prostheses, cements 
B. Tissue and tissue fluid (incl. prolonged mucous membrane) 
e.g., pacemakers, drug delivery  devices, breast implants, IUDs  
C. Blood 
  e.g., pacemaker electrodes, vascular grafts, heart valves </text>

Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER): drugs 
Center for Biologic Eval uation and Research (CBER) : biological therapeutics 
combination products (therapeutic + device) ma y fall under any of above 
Premarket Approval Process for Class III Devices 
Established in: Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 814  
1. Administrative and lim ited scientific review  
- conducted by FDA personnel within 45 days of receipt 
- determines if application is of sufficient quality for filing 
- &#8220;filing&#8221; initiates 18 0-day review clock 
2. In-depth scientific, regulatory and Quality System review 
-conducted by FDA personnel 
-includes inspection of manufacturing facility 
-	usually results in a &#8220;deficiency letter&#8221;  
     voices FDA concerns with an application 
Major deficiency letter &#8211; stops the 180-day clock 
Minor deficiency letter &#8211; 180-day clock continues 
- applicant has 30 da ys to respond   
3. 	Advisory panel review </text>

Depth-Resolved ESCA/XPS 
&#190; The probability of a photoelectron escaping the sample without 
undergoing inelastic collision is inversely related to its depth t within 
the sample: 
&#9115;&#8722;t &#9118;() ~ e x p &#9116; Pt 
&#9117;&#955;e &#9120;&#9119; 
where &#955;e (typically ~ 5-30 &#197;) is the electron inelastic mean-free path , 
which depends on the el ectron kinetic energy and the material.  
(Physically, &#955;e = avg. distance traveled between inelastic collisions.)

Surface Characterization of Biomaterials in Vacuum 
The structure and chemistry of a biom aterial surface greatly dictates the 
degree of biocompatibility of an implant.  Surf ace characterization is 
thus a central aspect of biomaterials research. 
Surface chemistry  can be investigated directly using high vacuum 
methods: 
&#8226;	Electron spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA)/X-ray 
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) 
&#8226;	Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) 
&#8226;	Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) 
1. XPS/ESCA 
Theoretical Basis:  
&#190; Secondary electrons ejected by x-ray bombardment from the 
sample near surface (0.5-10 nm)  with characteristic energies  
&#190; Analysis  of the photoelectron energies yields a quantitative 
measure of the surface composition

Case Examples 
1. Diabetes Treatment by Cell Encapsulation 
Diabetes Mellitus (Type I or insulin-dependent): pancreatic disorder in which 
pancreas ceases to produce insulin 
&#8226; 100M cases worldwide 
&#8226; 15M cases in U.S. &#8658; $94B in treatment annually 
&#8226; Symptoms: tiredness, weight  loss, extreme thirst 
Note: In Type II diabetes, 
insulin is manufactured 
but not used. 
Traditional Therapy : Daily insulin injections 
Problem: abnormal release pattern  generates long-t erm complications 
&#8226; Blindness 
&#8226; Loss of circulation in limbs (frequently requires amputation) 
&#8226; Kidney failure 
What is Insulin? 
&#8226; hormone (MW ~6 kD) released in response to blood glucose levels 
&#8226; assists cells in glucose absorption </text>

- Implanted in peritonea l (abdominal) cavity 
- Membrane connected to vasc ulature by PTFE grafts 
- No exogenous insulin r equired for &gt; 10 weeks 
- Little fibrosis up to 30 weeks  (biocompatible acrylic) 
- Mechanisms of failure: 
a) membrane rupture (80-90% of devices by 5-7 mo.) 
b) thrombosis 
c) infection 
d) loss of islet functi on, islet necrosis 
 
 
 
&#8226; Human trials 1994 (Sharp &amp; Lacy) 
 
- Implanted subcutaneously 
- PAN-PVC hollow fiber (1.5 cm length)  
- Human islets in alginate matrix 
- 90-95% islet viability after 2 weeks  
 
 
Limitation:  Insulin quantity&#8212;several meters of fiber for th erapeutic # of cells 
 Possible solutions:   
a) &#8220;super&#8221; cell lines&#8212;high insulin  output, low nutrient needs 
b) advances in angiogenesis

Protein Adsorption on Biomaterial Surfaces  
 
Background 
a) Pr otein acti vity varies i n adsorbed vs. solvated state 
 
Why?         
 
1. higher local concentration &#8212; function may be 
conc. dependent 
 
 e.g., cell adhesion increases with adhesion 
peptide concentr ation 
  
 
 
 
2. change in reactivity &#8212;access to &#8220;active&#8221; a.a. 
sequence &#8593; or &#8595; 
 
&#8658; enhanced or reduce d binding capability 
 
e.g., fibri nogen:  platelets adhere when adsor bed, 
not in sol n. 
 
 
3. denaturation &#8212;conformation varies from soln.   
     conformation 
&#8658; different a.a. sequences exposed 
 
*enhance or deactivate normal function  
     * elicit unintended functi on 
 
e.g., nat ural pol ymer s used as biomat erials are 
more immunogenic than synthetic polymers

In adsorption experiments , the val ue usually meas ured is a s urface 
concentration, e.g., ng/cm2 or &#181;g/cm2 &#8211; often denoted as &#915; or &#952;

Biosensors 
1. What are biosensors? 
The term is used in the literature in many ways.  So me definitions: 
a) A device used to measure biologically-derived signals  
b) A device that &#8220;senses&#8221; using &#8220;biomi metic&#8221; (imitative of life) strategies   
ex.,&#8220;artificial nose&#8221; 
c) A device that detects the presence of biomolecules 
We will adopt a recen t IUPAC definition: 
&#8220;A self-contained integrated device which [sic] is capable of providing 
specific quantitative or semi-qua ntitative analytical information using a 
biological recognition element which is in direct spatial contact with a 
transducer element.&#8221; 
2. Uses of biosensors 
&#8226; Quality assurance in agriculture, food and pharmaceutical industries 
ex. E. Coli, Salmonella 
&#8226; Monitoring environmental polluta nts &amp; biological warfare agents 
ex., Bacillus anthracis  (anthrax) spores 
&#8226; Medical diagnostics  
ex., glucose  
&#8226; Biological assays 
ex., DNA microarrays </text>

3. Classes of biosensors 
A) Catalytic biosensors: kinetic devices that measure steady-state concentration   
    of a transducer-detectable species formed/lost due to a biocatalytic reaction 
Monitored quantities:	 i) rate of product formation 
ii) disappearance of a reactant 
iii) inhibition of a reaction 
 Biocatalysts used: 	 i) enzymes 
ii) microorganisms 
ii) organelles 
iv) tissue samples 
B) Affinity biosensors : devices in which receptor molecules bind analyte  
    molecules &#8220;irreversibl y&#8221;, causing a physicochemical change that is detected  
     by a transducer
 Receptor molecules: i) antibodies 
ii) nucleic acids  
iii) hormone receptors 
Biosensors are most often used to detect molecules of biological origin , based 
on specific interactions. </text>

Example 2:  fiber optic sensors: fluorophore s incorporated into tip change 
fluorescence level depending on level of target present 
crosslinked network tip with 
entrapped fluorophores &amp; 
E=h&#957;2 light of initial E = h &#957;1 
biomolecule (light used to 
photopolymerize matrix!) measure fluorescent 
light returning: excites fluorophore 
Typically: 
- Oxygen present at tip q uenches fluorescence from tr apped fluorophore (ex., 
tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10 phenantroline) Ru(II) dichloride = Ru(dpp) 32+ Cl2) 
- Action of trapped oxidase (biological  element, ex., GOD) depletes O 2, causing 
&#8593; fluorophore emission 
Glucose 	+ O 2 + H 2O &#8594; Gluconic acid + H 2O2

How can we account for 
natural O 2 fluctuations? 
Multichannel fiber optic : 1. enhancing selectivity and/or 
2. multianalyte detection   
How can we measure multiple

A) Detection Elements 
 
1) Catalysis Strategies : enzymes most common 
    ex., glucose oxidase,  urease (catalyzes urea hydr olysis), alcohol oxidase, etc. 
 Commercial Example: glucose sensor using glucose oxidase (GOD) 
 
Glucose  +  O
2 + H 2O &#8594; Gluconic acid + H 2O2 
                                 GOD 
 
3 potential measurement routes:   1. pH change (acid production) 
      2 .  O 2 consumption (fluorophore monitor) 
      3 .  H 2O2 production (electrochemical) 
  
Commercially Available Biosensors:  glucose, lactate, alcohol, sucrose, 
galactose, uric acid, alpha amylase, ch oline, L-lysine&#8212;all amperometric based 
(O
2 /H 2O2) 
 
 
 
2) Affinity Binding strategies : antibodies &amp; nucleic acid fragments most 
common  
 
Commercial Example:  DNA chip

6. Ideal Biosensor Characteristics 
1. Sensitivity: high &#8710;S/ &#8710;canalyte    (S = signal) 
2. Simple calibration  (with standards) 
3. Linear Response: &#8710;S/ &#8710;canalyte  constant over larg e concentration range 
4. Background Signal: low noise, with ability for correction (ex., 2nd fiber 
sensor head lacking biological species to meas ure background O 2 changes) 
5. No hysteresis&#8212;signal  independent of prior hi story of measurements 
6. Selectivity&#8212;response only to change s in target analyte concentration 
7. Long-term Stability&#8212;not subject to f ouling, poisoning, or oxide formation 
that interferes with signal; prolon ged stability of bi ological molecule 
8. Dynamic Response&#8212;rapid  response to variation in analyte concentration 
9. Biocompatibility&#8212;minimiz e clotting, platelet interactions, activation of 
complement when in direct contact with bloodstream  </text>

- lysis of pathogens via membrane  pore formation (C5b, C6-C9)   
3 recognized pathways (to C5 convertase) 
Classical pathway: 
antigen-antibody immune complex (IC)

2. Bacterial Infection 
&#8226;	Bacteria compete with cells to adhere to surface 
&#190; similar mechanisms; better adapted to nonviable surfaces
&#190; resistant to antibiotics (dif ferent surface expression) 
&#8226; Most common bacterial infections: 
&#190; metallic  biomaterials: S. aureus
&#190; have receptors for fibr onectin &amp; collagen  
&#190; ) polymeric  biomaterials: S. epidermidis  (on skin
ex. artificial hearts, synt hetic vessels, joint replac ement implants, fixation 
devices, IV catheters, urologic devices, contact lenses 
~60,000 U.S. deaths/yr from device-related infections 
urinary catheters, central venous catheters 
3. Blood Incompatibility 
&#8226;	blood-materials interactions lead to clot or thrombus 
&#190; may compromise device by occlusion 
ex. small (&lt; 5 mm dia.) vascular grafts,  stents, IV catheters 
Diagrams of stent &#190; may detach ( embolize ) &amp; create vessel occlusion downstream  
and heart valve removed

Quantifying Cell Behavior 
1. Cell Cultures 
a. Why use cell cultures? 
in vivo  (living organisms) in vitro (glass, i.e., culture) 
Pros 1. native 3D environment 1. simplified model systems 
2. all relevant signals present 2. study parameters independently 
3. observe as function of time 
Cons 1. many variables &#8211; noisy data 1. unnatural 2D environment 
2. animal rights concerns 2. may lack important signals 
b. Types of cell cultures 
Primary cultures:  directly from living organism 
&#9786; reflect function of real organism / eventually die off; # 
/ some cell types poor dividers (nerve) Primary cells 
time 
Cell lines:  derived from primary cells (not clones)

Quantification approaches: 
1. individual cell measurements 
2. migration of cell populations 
&#190; Individual Cell Measurements : 
Time-lapse videomicroscopy  tracks cell motion (beneath fluid or gel) on 
a surface as a function of time elapsed.   
d 
1. Measure distance traveled from starting pt. ( d) as a function of 
time ( t) 
2. Fit data to model to obtain rms speed (S) and persistence time (P) 
(cell dependent)

3. Standard deviations  of computed values 
&#190; If quantity z of interest is a function  of measured parameters 
z = f(x,y,...) 
What is S z? We assume: z = f (x , y ,...) 
Deviations ( &#948;z) of z from its universal va lue can be written as: 
&#8706;z &#8706;z&#8706;z = &#8706;x + &#8706;y +...&#8706;x &#8706;y 
The standard deviation fo r z is calculated: 
2 2&#9115;&#8706; z &#9118; 2 &#9115;&#8706; z &#9118; 2Sz = 
&#9117;&#9116;&#9116;&#8706; x &#9119;&#9119;Sx +&#9116; &#9119;&#9116; &#9119; Sy +... y&#9120; &#9117;&#8706;&#9120; 
Case Example:  We measure motility ( &#181;) and persistence ( P) of a cell and want 
to know the standard de viation of the speed: 
S 2 P &#181;=  rearranges to S = 2 &#181;

&#190; Many calculators, spre adsheets &amp; other math tools are programmed to 
perform linear least-squares fitting, as well as fits to more complex 
equations following a similar premise. 
&#190; Many nonlinear equations can be line arized by taking the log of both 
sides 
e.g., 
m ln y =bx becomes ln y = mx + ln b 
or y ' = mx '+ b ' 
&#190; Multiple regression 
In some cases, we wish to fit data  dependent on more than one independent 
variable. The proc edure will be exactly analogous  to that used above, and 
solutions can be ob tained through matrix algebra.   
Here we will consider the simple case of a linear dependence on 2 independent 
variables. 
Our minimization criterion can thus be written:  
N 
M =&#8721;[ y &#8722; (ab x + c zi )] = minimum i + i 2 
i=1 
&#8706;M &#8706;M &#8706;MMathematically we require: &#8706;a = 0, = 0, = 0&#8706;b &#8706;c

Case Example : Measurements of C5a productio n for blood exposure to an 
extracorpeal filtration dev ice and tubing gave same  means, but different 
variabilities. Are the standard deviati ons different within 95% confidence? 
Control (tubing only):  S x&#8217;2 = 26 ( &#181;g/ml)2, &#957;2 =9 
Filtration device: S x2 = 32 ( &#181;g/ml)2, &#957;1 = 7 
21. Calculate Sx 2 and Sx&#8217; (provided) 
2. Compute F 
2SxF =S 2 = 32/26 = 1.231 
x ' 
3. Determine critical F values from F-distribution chart 
&#957;1 =7 and &#957;2 =9 (m, n for use with tables) 
1&#8722; P = 0.025 &#8658; F0.025 = 0.207 2 
1+ P = 0.975 &#8658; F0.975 = 4.202 
For 0.207 &#8804; F &#8804; 4.20 &#8658; &#963; x = &#963;x&#8217;
 F=1.231 falls within this interval.

C. F Distribution 
&#190; Allows comparison of variability of  behavior between  populations  
using test of hypothesis: &#963;x = &#963;x&#8217;
Named for British statistician 
Sir Ronald A. Fisher. Define a statistic: 
2 2&#967; 2 =&#957;1S /&#963; where &#957;1 is degrees of freedom. &#957;1

&#190; Quantifying Error of the Straight-Line Fit 
If the error on each yi is unknown (e.g., a single measurement was made): 
The standard deviation for the regression line  is given by: 
M&#963;= N &#8722; 2	N-2 in denominator since 2 degrees of 
freedom are taken in calculating m and 
b (two points make a line, so &#963; for N=2 
is meaningless. )This assumes: 
-a normal distribution of data points about the line 
- spread of points is of sim ilar magnitude for full data range 
&#8220;Goodness&#8221; of fit can be fu rther characterized by the correlation coefficient, r 
(or coefficient of determination, r2), calculated as: 
N 2 
&#8721;( y &#8722; y )	&#8722; Mi 
r 2 = i=1

Sources of data variation: 
&#190; Contamination of surface &#8658;  cytotoxicity or modi fied surface chemistry 
&#190; Variations in the number of ce lls seeded on each surface  
&#190; Variations in biomaterial synthesi s (reagent amounts, T, time, etc.) 
&#190; Variations in cells (d ifferent cell passages) 
&#190; Variations in media (e.g ., different concentrations, proteins agglomerated) 
&#190; Variations in sterilization procedure 
&#190; Researcher error (e.g., sneezing on samples)

Biomaterials Surfaces: Chemistry 
Like metallic implants, some polymers used in biomaterials applications 
are susceptible to chemical reactions that lead to degradation through 
hydrolysis. In many cases, a polymer is specifically chosen for its ability 
to degrade in vivo.   
Polymer Hydrolysis 
Polymer hydrolysis involves the sc ission of suscep tible molecular 
groups by reaction with H 2O. 
&#190; May be acid, base or enzyme catalyzed

Biomaterials Characterization in Aqueous Environments 
 
 
High vacuum techniques are important tools for characterizing surface 
composition, but do not yield info rmation on surface structure or 
chemistry in a water-based environment. 
 
  
Aqueous-based methods for surface ch aracterization are limited.  Here 
we will consider three common techniques:  
 
1. water contact angle studies  
- surface reconstruction (a) 
- water absorption (b) 
- surface chemistry analysis

 3. Force modulation mode 
 
&#190; Tip oscillates in z-axis at  &#969; &lt; &#969;&#959; = (k/m)1/2 (cantilever resonance 
frequency), making interm ittent sample contact; &#969; ~3-120kHz.  
 
&#190; Interactions between tip and sa mple cause amplitude attenuation 
 
&#190; Contact force applied to sample is  modulated, giving elasticity

Measurement of Adsorbed Proteins 
1. Techniques for Quantifying Adsorbed Amount 
a) Labeling Methods : tag protein for quantifica tion, use known standards 
for calibration 
i) Radioisotopic labeling 
&#190; proteins labeled with radioactive isotopes that react with 
specific a.a. residues 
e.g., tyrosine labeling with 125I; 131I; 32P 
OH - CH 2 125I 
-CH 2 OH 
125I 
&#190; Small % radioactive proteins added to unlabelled protein  
&#190; &#947; counts measured and cali brated to give cpm/ &#181;g 
Advantage: high signal-to-noise &#8658; measure small amts (ng) 
Disads: dangerous &#947; emissions, waste disposal, requires protein  
     isolation  
ii) Fluorescent labels 
&#190; measure fluorescence from optical excitation of tag </text>

For a rough estimate of &#945;-helix content, the follo wing expressions have 
been employed: 
208&#945;&#8722; helix % = [&#952;] &#8722; 4000 
33, 000 &#8722;4000 from [ &#952;]mrd data at 208 nm 
&#952;&#945;&#8722; helix % = []222
40, 000 from [ &#952;]mrd data at 222 nm 
Advantages: no labeling required; simple set-up 
Disads: need experimental geometry wi th high surface area, e.g.,  
     colloidal particles (high signal)

Surface Modification Methods 
A. Plasma Treatments 
Plasmas : ionized gases (ions, el ectrons, free radicals , atoms, molecules) 
created by ion/electron impact under applied E-field:  A + e &#8594; A+ + 2e 
Uses 
1. surface etching 
&#190; employs inert gases (e.g., Ar) 
&#190; purposes: remove impurities, increase roughness 
2. surface reactions 
&#190; crosslink polymer surfaces 
                  modify tr ansport properties, redu ce surface mobility  
&#190; generate surface functional groups 
&#8593; or &#8595; &#947;1, create reactive surfaces

Surface Phenomena 
A simple rule: Surface phenomena are dr iven primarily by an 
associated reduction in surface free energy. 
Important examples in biomaterials: 
&#8226; adsorption of a species from environment 
&#8226; surface segregation of a species from bulk 
&#8226; surface reconstructions 
&#8226; surface reactions 
1. Adsorption phenomena 
Tenet 1: Higher energy surfaces are quickly coated /contaminated by 
lower energy species. 
Examples: * Water on glasses, metals or oxides 
* Hydrocarbons on inorganic surfaces 
* Surfactants at air/water interface Measured &#947; of metals &amp; 
oxides ~ 37 dyn/cm 
Classes of adsorption: 
&#190; chemisorption &#8211; strong modifications to electronic 
structure/electron density of adsorbate molecule     (&gt; 0.5 
eV/surface site) 
Example: H 2O on silica H O H 
OH OHEads = 1.7 eV O 
Si Si Si Si 
O O </text>

          <text>11 3.051J/20.340J 
Surface segregation also occurs co mmonly in organic materials&#8230; 
Example 2: PVC blended w/ 0.25 wt% short fluorocarbon 
(C45O18F59H31). 
&#947;PVC = 41 dyn/cm vs. &#947;blend = 17.3 dyn/cm &#8776; pure -CF 3 
&#947;CF3 = 14.5 dyn/cm 
In polymers, ENTROPY can play a significant role in surface 
segregation. Chain ends surface segregate 
to decrease entropic penalty 
Polymer &#8220;random coil&#8221; 
conformations are restricted by the presence of a surface 
&#8658; Less chain configurations! 
Short chains surface segregate 
when mixed with long chains 
Surface segregation importance to 
biomaterials applications: 
&#8226; Toxicity 
&#8226; Corrosion resistance Surface modification with a 
&#8226; Modified protein/cell adhesivity comb polymer additive 
But&#8230;also a strategy for 
surface modification!

The hydrophilicity  of a surface can be gauged by measuring the contact angle  of a 
droplet of water on the surface.  The balan ce of interfacial forces is described by

2. Surface Segregation
An interfacial adsorptio n phenomenon involving a bulk component of a 
multi-component material. 
Example 1: Surface segregation of a dilute solute (B) in a binary AB alloy  
Surface fraction of B (X B,S) can be described using the Langmuir-
McLean relation: 
X BS = XB &#9121;&#8722;&#8710;GS &#9124; , 
&#9122; &#9125;1 &#8722; XBS 1 &#8722; XB exp

Tenet 2: The &#8220;high energy surface&#8221;  of tenet 1 is relative to its 
surrounding medium. 
In H 2O based environments, a hyd rophilic material has a lower 
interfacial energy  than a hydrophobic one. 
Example: Adsorption/denaturing of pr oteins on hydrophobic surfaces in 
water-based environments

CH 3 H 
O 
&#9168; + + _ + OH 
+ _ _ 
Charged &amp; H-bonding groups orient 
towards H 2O; hydrophobic groups 
orient towards polyethylene 
Such adsorption phenom ena are examples of &#8220;t hermodynamic adhesion&#8221; 
Adhesion &#8211; state in which 2 dissimilar bodies are held together in 
intimate contact such that a force can be transferred  across the interface. 
Thermodynamic adhesion is driven by interfacial forces associated with 
reversible  processes.   </text>

A Simple Corrosion Rule: anything that upsets the dynamic 
equilibrium of the charged double layer can accelerate corrosion.   
Galvanic Corrosion :  if 2 metals in  contact where -E A &gt; -E B (i.e., A 
more neg./anodic) , B becomes an e-&#8220;sink&#8221; &#8658; accelerating corrosion of 
A 
B + 
+ +

2. Aqueous Corrosion of Metals 
In water or in vivo , even a &#8220;passive&#8221; oxide l ayer (terminated by bound 
water) becomes susceptible to corrosion.   
Why? 
&#8226; Mz+ diffusion will always occur 
&#8226; oxide may dissolve  
&#8226; damage to oxide layer 
Corrosion : the destructive result of chemic al rxn between a metal or 
metal alloy and its environment. 
Aqueous corrosion : involves electronic charge transfer 
i.e., an electrochemical rxn 
Typically, metal surface acts as both anode  (oxidation=loss of e-) &amp; 
cathode (reduction=consumption of e-) in different regions 
-anodic rxn: M &#8594; Mz+ + ze 
cathodic rxns:  O 2 (dissolved) + 4H+ + 4e-&#8594; 2H 2O 
in acidic 2H+ + 2e-&#8594; H 2 (g) 
O2 (dissolved) + 2H 2O + 4e-&#8594; 4OH&#173;
in neutral 
or basic    2 H 2O + 2e-&#8594; H 2 (g) + 2OH&#173;
Locally, a biological environment can be neutral, acidic or basic.

How does metal ox idation happen?  
One scenario  is&#8230; 
step 1 : physisorption of O 2; ~20-25 kJ/mol 	1 eV/molec = 96.5 kJ/mol 
kT293 &#8776; 0.025 eV 
step 2 : molecular oxygen dissociates and  
            reduces by chemisorption;  ~600 kJ/mol 
step 3:  bond rearrangement; crysta llization of oxide layer 
Resultant reduction in surface energy 
&#947;Compare: at 1400 &#176;C: &#947;&#948;-Fe = 1900 dyn/cm 
FeO = 580 dyn/cm 
Consider metal oxidation  as 2 half reactions: 
O2 + ze-
Electrons and ions must traverse 
the oxide layer  for rxn to proceed.  
Across the oxide film, an  oxidation potential,  
E0 ~ 1V generates an  electric field:

Lecture 3: Biomaterials Surfaces: Chemistry 
Surfaces are high-energy regions of materials and thereby facilitate 
chemical reactions  that influence perform ance of biomaterials. 
This lecture will focus on 2 classes of surface chemistry relevant to 
biomaterials: 
&#8226; Chemisorption on meta ls and oxides  
&#8226; Aqueous corrosion of metals 
1. Chemisorption
Strong modifications to electroni c structure/ electron density of 
adsorbate molecule (&gt; 0.5 eV/surface site)

&#8706;C &#8706;2C
The change in drug conc entration with time is: &#8706;t =D
&#8706;x2 
We want to calculate: 
&#8226; dM t/dt = release rate 
&#8226; Mt = amount released after time t 
&#8658; Solve Fick&#8217;s 2nd law with initial &amp; boundary conditions. 
Example:  For a 1D slab loaded at an initial concentration of C0, with drug 
concentration in solution  resulting in constant su rface concentration of Ci.

Bone Remodeling 
&#8226;	Bone structure is dynamic, responding to: 
-load 
-local physiological conditions 
ex. Cortical bone turnover in femur ~3%/yr 
&#8226; Bone is torn down an d reconstructed by cell te ams (Basic Multicellular 
Units or BMUs) 
-Osteoclasts:  bone resorption cells, re lated to macrophages 
-Osteoblasts: bone deposition cells, re lated to fibroblasts 
-Osteocytes:  osteoblasts that get trappe d in osteon, beco me quiescent 
&#8226; Fatigue may direct remodeling

Properties Desirable for Bone Replacements 
&#190; Stiffness  (structural support, low de formation energy losses) 
&#190; Flexure Strength, compliancy  (1/E) (avoid break on falling) 
&#190; Low Mass  (light, reduce energy losses while walking) 
&#190; Long lifetime (high endurance, fatigue strength)

Lecture 21: 
Biomaterials for Organ Replacement 
Therapies for Organ Replacement 
1. Transplantation 
Replacement of tissue or organ from human or animal donor 
Allograft &#8212;human donor (e.g., kidney, liver, heart) 
Xenograft &#8212;animal donor (e.g., po rcine aortic valves) 
Adv: 
&#8226; complete recovery of lost function for patient lifetime 
Disads: 
&#8226; possibility of rejection&#8212;at tack by immune system 
&#8226; side effects of immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., steroids) 
&#8226; limited donor pool 
2. Autograft 
Donor is also recipient  
Examples:  skin grafts, nerve grafts, br east reconstructions, saphenous  
(calf) vein for coronary or  peripheral artery bypass  (~300,000/yr in U.S.) 
Adv: 
&#8226; complete recovery of lost function for patient lifetime 
&#8226; virtually no danger of rejection 
Disads: 
&#8226; limited self-donor tissue available 
&#8226; trauma/scarring at removal site </text>

&#190; Strength : several quantities of in terest for comparison 
1. Modulus  (since higher E materials correlate with higher strength) 
2. Yield stress &#8212;stress at onset of plastic deformation  
3. Ultimate (tensile) strength (UTS) &#8212;peak of stress-strain curve 
4. Fracture strength &#8212;stress at point of fracture 
engineering &#8212;measured value 
true&#8212;value that accounts for ne cking (change in  x-sec area) 
    (lower than compression  strength, higher than UTS) 
5. Fatigue strength -max. load withstood 10 M cycles w/o fracture 
Cyclic Fatigue : Material subjected to cyclic stress for long times below its 
UTS but above its &#8220;endurance limit&#8221; &#8658; fracture

Modeling Anisotro pic Composites 
Example: a uniaxially -oriented, continuous 2- phase structure 
Load along the longitudinal axis: 
Voigt model: equal strains 
( p a r a l l e l s t r a i n m o d e l ) 
E = E 1V1 + E 2V2 
(Vi is volume fraction 
of ith  component) 
(Derived from F i = A iEi&#949;i) 
Load along tran sverse axis: 
Reuss model: equal stresses 
( s e r i e s s t r a i n m o d e l ) 
1 V1 + V2= EE1 E2 
(Note: text gives governing eqns for other composite structures, such as 
randomly oriented fiber/matrix composites) </text>

Mechanical Properties of Interest  in Biomaterials Applications: 
&#8226; Stiffness 
&#8226; Strength 
&#8226; Toughness 
We need methods to quantify &#8226; Hardness 
these material qualities.&#8226; Fatigue (especially cyclic) 
&#8226; Fracture strength 
&#8226; Wear resistance
