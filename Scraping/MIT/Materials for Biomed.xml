Regulation History  
1906 Food and Drug Act 
   - established the FDA 
- no provisions on medical devices 
     (regulated by the U.S. Postal  Service under postal fraud statutes ) 
1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 
- FDA regulation of  device misbrandin g/adulteration  
(inadequate authority/resour ces for wide scale regulation) 
1976 Medical Device Amendment 
Classified Devices &amp; Regulat ory Standards for Safety &amp; Efficacy 
Class I: low risk, general controls sufficient  
   over the counter products-e.g., adhesive bandages, hospital beds 
Class II: performance standards &amp; general control 
physician controlled distributi on-e.g., oxygen masks, blood-
pressure cuffs, pow ered wheelchairs 
Class III: require pre-market approval 
devices that: support or sustain human life, are of substantial 
importance in preventing impairme nt of human health, or which 
present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury

 Lecture 12:  
Biomaterials Characterization in Aqueous Environments 
 
 
High vacuum techniques are important tools for characterizing surface 
composition, but do not yield info rmation on surface structure or 
chemistry in a water-based environment. 
 
  
Aqueous-based methods for surface ch aracterization are limited.  Here 
we will consider three common techniques:  
 
1. water contact angle studies  
- surface reconstruction (a) 
- water absorption (b) 
- surface chemistry analysis

 3. Force modulation mode 
 
 Tip oscillates in z-axis at   &lt;  = (k/m)1/2 (cantilever resonance 
frequency), making interm ittent sample contact;  ~3-120kHz.  
 
 Interactions between tip and sa mple cause amplitude attenuation 
 
 Contact force applied to sample is  modulated, giving elasticity 
information

 4. Non-contact AFM  
 
 Oscillation near resonance frequency without  tip-surface contact

2. Tapping mode    
 Tip oscillates in z-axis at high  (~50-500 kHz in air, 10 kHz in 
fluids) with intermittent sample contact  eliminates shear forces    
  
 Interactions between tip and sa mple cause amplitude attenuation

Surface Characterization of Biomaterials in Vacuum 
The structure and chemistry of a biom aterial surface greatly dictates the 
degree of biocompatibility of an implant.  Surf ace characterization is 
thus a central aspect of biomaterials research. 
Surface chemistry  can be investigated directly using high vacuum 
methods: 
	Electron spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA)/X-ray 
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) 
	Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) 
	Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) 
1. XPS/ESCA 
Theoretical Basis:  
 Secondary electrons ejected by x-ray bombardment from the 
sample near surface (0.5-10 nm)  with characteristic energies

Quantifying Cell Behavior 
1. Cell Cultures 
a. Why use cell cultures? 
in vivo  (living organisms) in vitro (glass, i.e., culture) 
Pros 1. native 3D environment 1. simplified model systems 
2. all relevant signals present 2. study parameters independently 
3. observe as function of time 
Cons 1. many variables  noisy data 1. unnatural 2D environment 
2. animal rights concerns 2. may lack important signals 
b. Types of cell cultures 
Primary cultures:  directly from living organism 
 reflect function of real organism / eventually die off; # 
/ some cell types poor dividers (nerve) Primary cells

 Cell Spreading Assay 
1. Cell type seeded onto surface of interest at given density (#/area) 
for a specified time 
2. Measure projected surface area (optical microscopy)

 Centrifugation assay:  (normal force) 
1. Cell type seeded into 24- well plate with surface coating 
for a specified time 
2. Plate is inverted in centrifuge an d cells attached vs. applied force is

Quantification approaches: 
1. individual cell measurements 
2. migration of cell populations 
 Individual Cell Measurements : 
Time-lapse videomicroscopy  tracks cell motion (beneath fluid or gel) on 
a surface as a function of time elapsed.   
d 
1. Measure distance traveled from starting pt. ( d) as a function of 
time ( t) 
2. Fit data to model to obtain rms speed (S) and persistence time (P) 
(cell dependent) 
P: time before memory of initial direct ion is lost (typically min-hrs) 
S: measure of centroid displacement per time (typically 1-50 m/h)

Chemotaxis 
If chemotactic or haptotactic (surface -bound signaling) ag ent is present, 
mean displacement &lt; d(t)&gt; is nonzero. 
We can quantify the degre e of chemotacticity of a migration with the 
Chemotactic Index , CI:

 Radioactive decay Poisson  distribution 
 Only 2 possible outcomes Binomial distribution 
3. Standard deviations  of computed values 
 If quantity z of interest is a function  of measured parameters 
z = f(x,y,...) 
What is S z? We assume: z = f (x , y ,...) 
Deviations ( z) of z from its universal va lue can be written as: 
z zz = x + y +...x y 
The standard deviation fo r z is calculated: 
2 2 z  2  z  2Sz = 
 x Sx +   Sy +... y  
Case Example:  We measure motility ( ) and persistence ( P) of a cell and want 
to know the standard de viation of the speed:

 Many calculators, spre adsheets &amp; other math tools are programmed to 
perform linear least-squares fitting, as well as fits to more complex 
equations following a similar premise. 
 Many nonlinear equations can be line arized by taking the log of both 
sides 
e.g., 
m ln y =bx becomes ln y = mx + ln b 
or y ' = mx '+ b ' 
 Multiple regression 
In some cases, we wish to fit data  dependent on more than one independent 
variable. The proc edure will be exactly analogous  to that used above, and 
solutions can be ob tained through matrix algebra.   
Here we will consider the simple case of a linear dependence on 2 independent 
variables. 
Our minimization criterion can thus be written:

line), we get:

 Quantifying Error of the Straight-Line Fit 
If the error on each yi is unknown (e.g., a single measurement was made): 
The standard deviation for the regression line  is given by: 
M= N  2	N-2 in denominator since 2 degrees of 
freedom are taken in calculating m and 
b (two points make a line, so  for N=2 
is meaningless. )This assumes: 
-a normal distribution of data points about the line 
- spread of points is of sim ilar magnitude for full data range 
Goodness of fit can be fu rther characterized by the correlation coefficient, r 
(or coefficient of determination, r2), calculated as:

Statistical Analysis in Biomaterials Research 
1. Rationale: Why is statistical analysis needed in biomaterials research? 
 Many error sources  in measurements on living systems!

Case Example: cell sedimentation assay of % of cells adherin g to a biomaterial 
vs. control (the simplest cell assay) 
Sources of data variation: 
 Contamination of surface   cytotoxicity or modi fied surface chemistry 
 Variations in the number of ce lls seeded on each surface  
 Variations in biomaterial synthesi s (reagent amounts, T, time, etc.) 
 Variations in cells (d ifferent cell passages) 
 Variations in media (e.g ., different concentrations, proteins agglomerated) 
 Variations in sterilization procedure 
 Researcher error (e.g., sneezing on samples) 
 Behavior is best characterized by a population or distibution of values 
Case Example:  Titration of HCl solution with  equimolar NaOH solution.

Lecture 9: 
Surface Modification of Biomaterials 
Purpose : alter surface properties to enhance performance in biological 
environment while retaining bulk properties of device 
Specific Objectives: 
1. clean a surface 
2. reduce/eliminate protein adsorption  
	reduce undesirable/uncontrolle d responses to implants &amp; 
extracorpeal devices 
C3b/IgG adsorption  activation of WBCs 
	reduce nonspecific adsorption  on biosensors &amp; bioassays 
Source: Wikipedia (Gray's Anatomy)(noise &amp; fouling) 
	current strategy: hydrated, hydrophilic surfaces   
       PEO is current gold standard 
3. reduce/eliminate cell adhesion  
	create surfaces that mimic natures cell resistant surfaces 
ex. Human serum albumin: naturally low affinity to 
      components of body fluids &amp; tissues ( consider its 
     high conc. in blood60 wt% of proteins! )</text>

2. Bacterial Infection 
	Bacteria compete with cells to adhere to surface 
 similar mechanisms; better adapted to nonviable surfaces
 resistant to antibiotics (dif ferent surface expression) 
 Most common bacterial infections: 
 metallic  biomaterials: S. aureus
 have receptors for fibr onectin &amp; collagen  
 ) polymeric  biomaterials: S. epidermidis  (on skin
ex. artificial hearts, synt hetic vessels, joint replac ement implants, fixation 
devices, IV catheters, urologic devices, contact lenses 
~60,000 U.S. deaths/yr from device-related infections 
urinary catheters, central venous catheters 
3. Blood Incompatibility 
	blood-materials interactions lead to clot or thrombus 
 may compromise device by occlusion 
ex. small (&lt; 5 mm dia.) vascular grafts,  stents, IV catheters 
Diagrams of stent  may detach ( embolize ) &amp; create vessel occlusion downstream  
and heart valve removed

4. Toxicity 
	classical toxicity: from corrosion,  degradation or wear products; 
cytotoxicity increases with amount present 
	immune system toxicity: 
i) immunogenic substances: proteins, carbohydrates, 
    lipids (weakly) 
ex. processed colla gen, natural latex  
ii) small molecules  (metals, degradatio n products, drugs) bind on 
host proteins/cells , making an innocuou s substance antigenic

Cell-Surface Interactions: Host Resp onses to Biomaterials (Part II) 
Implantation of a biomaterial initiates the inflammatory response: 
- response of vascularized tissue to local injury 
- severity indicates bi ocompatibility of material 
Cooperative Signaling Cascades: 
1. Coagulation Cascade  
initiated by adsorbed
2. Complement Alternative Pathway proteins 
The complement  is a component of the immune system. 
Immune system function : to protect against pathogens 
Innate (Native) Immunity	 Adaptive (Aquired) Immunity 
-first line of defense - specificity to distinct foreign 
   biomolecules (antigens) 
-nonspecific response to 
   invading pathogens - memory of exposure 
-elicits adaptive response 
Physical/chemical barriers:  	 Blood proteins:  
epithelia, antimicrobial proteins antibodies (immunoglobulins), 
cytokines 
Blood proteins: complement; 
cytokines (regulatory) Cells:  lymphocytes (T cells, B cells)

a) Labeling Methods : tag protein for quantifica tion, use known standards 
for calibration

specific a.a. residues

125I 
 Small % radioactive proteins added to unlabelled protein  
  counts measured and cali brated to give cpm/ g 
Advantage: high signal-to-noise  measure small amts (ng) 
Disads: dangerous  emissions, waste disposal, requires protein  
     isolation  
ii) Fluorescent labels 
 measure fluorescence from optical excitation of tag</text>

Hypothesis: 
At t~0 : uniform [P i]s everywhere  protein with highest concentration  
dominates initial adsorption 
At t&gt;0:  local depletion of ad sorbed species near su rface exchange with  
faster diffusing species ensues 
At t&gt;&gt;0:  gradual exchange with hi gher affinity species 
2. Irreversible Adsorption

Models for Pro tein Ad sorptio n 
 
The simplest picture: Langmuir model  for reversible  adsor ption 
 
Makes analogy to chemi cal reaction kinetics: 
 
[P] = pr otein concentr ation in s olution (e.g., #/vol) 
[S] = density of unoccupied su rface  sites (e.g., #/area) 
[PS] = density of s urface sites occupied by protein  
 
 
 
Assumes: 1 protein binds 1 surface site
can involve multiple  secondary bonds P + S  PS     
 
 
 
Assuming the re action follows 1st order kinetics:   
 
adsorption rate =  k a[P][S]    
desorption rate = k d [PS]

Ka is an i ndicator  of the favorableness of adsorption.   Not e that Ka is the 
inverse of the dissociation const ant, Kd, which has uni ts of 
concentration, e.g., mol/L.    
 
 For [P] &lt; Kd, few occupied surface sites. 
 
 For [P] = Kd, half of the surface sites will be occupied. 
 
 
A second approach used to extract K is known as a Scatchard plot .

 Trans port: bind and deliver specifi c molecules to organs or across 
cell membrane 
 
e.g.,   hemoglobin  carries bound O 2 to tissues;  
serum albumin  transports fatty acids 
 
 
 Motile : provide mechanism for cell motion  e.g., vi a

e.g., actin, myosi n in muscle 
 
 
 Defense: proteins integral to the immune response  and coagul ation

Protein Adsorption on Biomaterial Surfaces  
 
Background 
a) Pr otein acti vity varies i n adsorbed vs. solvated state 
 
Why?         
 
1. higher local concentration  function may be 
conc. dependent 
 
 e.g., cell adhesion increases with adhesion 
peptide concentr ation 
  
 
 
 
2. change in reactivity access to active a.a. 
sequence  or  
 
 enhanced or reduce d binding capability 
 
e.g., fibri nogen:  platelets adhere when adsor bed, 
not in sol n. 
 
 
3. denaturation conformation varies from soln.   
     conformation 
 different a.a. sequences exposed 
 
*enhance or deactivate normal function  
     * elicit unintended functi on 
 
e.g., nat ural pol ymer s used as biomat erials are 
more immunogenic than synthetic polymers</text>

Biomaterials Surfaces: Chemistry 
Like metallic implants, some polymers used in biomaterials applications 
are susceptible to chemical reactions that lead to degradation through 
hydrolysis. In many cases, a polymer is specifically chosen for its ability 
to degrade in vivo.   
Polymer Hydrolysis 
Polymer hydrolysis involves the sc ission of suscep tible molecular 
groups by reaction with H 2O. 
 May be acid, base or enzyme catalyzed
 Not surface-limited if water penetrates bulk

2. Aqueous Corrosion of Metals 
In water or in vivo , even a passive oxide l ayer (terminated by bound 
water) becomes susceptible to corrosion.   
Why? 
 Mz+ diffusion will always occur 
 oxide may dissolve  
 damage to oxide layer 
Corrosion : the destructive result of chemic al rxn between a metal or 
metal alloy and its environment. 
Aqueous corrosion : involves electronic charge transfer 
i.e., an electrochemical rxn 
Typically, metal surface acts as both anode  (oxidation=loss of e-) &amp; 
cathode (reduction=consumption of e-) in different regions 
-anodic rxn: M  Mz+ + ze 
cathodic rxns:  O 2 (dissolved) + 4H+ + 4e- 2H 2O 
in acidic 2H+ + 2e- H 2 (g) 
O2 (dissolved) + 2H 2O + 4e- 4OH
in neutral 
or basic    2 H 2O + 2e- H 2 (g) + 2OH
Locally, a biological environment can be neutral, acidic or basic.</text>

How does metal ox idation happen?  
One scenario  is 
step 1 : physisorption of O 2; ~20-25 kJ/mol 	1 eV/molec = 96.5 kJ/mol 
kT293  0.025 eV 
step 2 : molecular oxygen dissociates and  
            reduces by chemisorption;  ~600 kJ/mol 
step 3:  bond rearrangement; crysta llization of oxide layer 
Resultant reduction in surface energy 
Compare: at 1400 C: -Fe = 1900 dyn/cm 
FeO = 580 dyn/cm 
Consider metal oxidation  as 2 half reactions: 
O2 + ze-
Electrons and ions must traverse 
the oxide layer  for rxn to proceed.  
Across the oxide film, an  oxidation potential,  
E0 ~ 1V generates an  electric field: 
x~1 nm M 
Mz+ M  Mz+ + ze - z O2-
G0 =  E z F E-Field  1 V/nm = 10 MV/cm 0

A Simple Corrosion Rule: anything that upsets the dynamic 
equilibrium of the charged double layer can accelerate corrosion.   
Galvanic Corrosion :  if 2 metals in  contact where -E A &gt; -E B (i.e., A 
more neg./anodic) , B becomes an e-sink  accelerating corrosion of 
A 
B + 
+ +

Bone Remodeling 
	Bone structure is dynamic, responding to: 
-load 
-local physiological conditions 
ex. Cortical bone turnover in femur ~3%/yr 
 Bone is torn down an d reconstructed by cell te ams (Basic Multicellular 
Units or BMUs) 
-Osteoclasts:  bone resorption cells, re lated to macrophages 
-Osteoblasts: bone deposition cells, re lated to fibroblasts 
-Osteocytes:  osteoblasts that get trappe d in osteon, beco me quiescent 
 Fatigue may direct remodeling   
Hypothesis 1: Debonding isolates osteon  low stress state  activate new 
BMUs (ex, osteocyte signal release or  low stress on bo ne lining cells)

We want to calculate: 
 dM t/dt = release rate 
 Mt = amount released after time t 
 Solve Ficks 2nd law with initial &amp; boundary conditions. 
Example:  For a 1D slab loaded at an initial concentration of C0, with drug 
concentration in solution  resulting in constant su rface concentration of Ci.

Surface Phenomena 
A simple rule: Surface phenomena are dr iven primarily by an 
associated reduction in surface free energy. 
Important examples in biomaterials: 
 adsorption of a species from environment 
 surface segregation of a species from bulk 
 surface reconstructions 
 surface reactions 
1. Adsorption phenomena 
Tenet 1: Higher energy surfaces are quickly coated /contaminated by 
lower energy species. 
Examples: * Water on glasses, metals or oxides 
* Hydrocarbons on inorganic surfaces 
* Surfactants at air/water interface Measured  of metals &amp; 
oxides ~ 37 dyn/cm 
Classes of adsorption: 
 chemisorption  strong modifications to electronic 
structure/electron density of adsorbate molecule     (&gt; 0.5 
eV/surface site) 
Example: H 2O on silica H O H 
OH OHEads = 1.7 eV O

          <slideno>5</slideno>
          <text>6 3.051J/20.340J 
Tenet 2: The high energy surface  of tenet 1 is relative to its 
surrounding medium. 
In H 2O based environments, a hyd rophilic material has a lower 
interfacial energy  than a hydrophobic one. 
Example: Adsorption/denaturing of pr oteins on hydrophobic surfaces in 
water-based environments 
HDPE  
CH 3 H 
O 
 + + _ + OH 
+ _ _ 
Charged &amp; H-bonding groups orient 
towards H 2O; hydrophobic groups 
orient towards polyethylene 
Such adsorption phenom ena are examples of t hermodynamic adhesion 
Adhesion  state in which 2 dissimilar bodies are held together in 
intimate contact such that a force can be transferred  across the interface. 
Thermodynamic adhesion is driven by interfacial forces associated with 
reversible  processes.</text>

3. Surface Reconstruction
Atomic or molecular rearrangement at surface to reduce surface/ 
interfacial tension. 
Example 1: Faceting in MgO 
Rocksalt structure 	 = O2-(fcc lattice pts)

(100) is preferred plane of cleavage  (charge neutral!) 
Miscut surfaces will facet ~0.1-1 m

2. Surface Segregation
An interfacial adsorptio n phenomenon involving a bulk component of a 
multi-component material. 
Example 1: Surface segregation of a dilute solute (B) in a binary AB alloy  
Surface fraction of B (X B,S) can be described using the Langmuir-
McLean relation: 
X BS = XB GS  ,

Surface segregation also occurs co mmonly in organic materials 
Example 2: PVC blended w/ 0.25 wt% short fluorocarbon 
(C45O18F59H31). 
PVC = 41 dyn/cm vs. blend = 17.3 dyn/cm  pure -CF 3 
CF3 = 14.5 dyn/cm 
In polymers, ENTROPY can play a significant role in surface 
segregation. Chain ends surface segregate 
to decrease entropic penalty 
Polymer random coil 
conformations are restricted by the presence of a surface 
 Less chain configurations! 
Short chains surface segregate 
when mixed with long chains

Surface enrichment  is given by:

BS R = 8.314 J/mol-K

The Langmuir-McLean relation indicates: 
 Surface enrichment occurs when GS is negative 
 Surface coverage increases with bu lk solute content 
 Surface enrichment decrea ses with increasing T 
GS can be estimated fr om the Miedema eqn:

Biosensors 
1. What are biosensors? 
The term is used in the literature in many ways.  So me definitions: 
a) A device used to measure biologically-derived signals  
b) A device that senses using biomi metic (imitative of life) strategies   
ex.,artificial nose 
c) A device that detects the presence of biomolecules 
We will adopt a recen t IUPAC definition: 
A self-contained integrated device which [sic] is capable of providing 
specific quantitative or semi-qua ntitative analytical information using a 
biological recognition element which is in direct spatial contact with a 
transducer element. 
2. Uses of biosensors 
 Quality assurance in agriculture, food and pharmaceutical industries 
ex. E. Coli, Salmonella 
 Monitoring environmental polluta nts &amp; biological warfare agents 
ex., Bacillus anthracis  (anthrax) spores 
 Medical diagnostics  
ex., glucose

Example 2:  fiber optic sensors: fluorophore s incorporated into tip change 
fluorescence level depending on level of target present 
crosslinked network tip with 
entrapped fluorophores &amp; 
E=h2 light of initial E = h 1 
biomolecule (light used to 
photopolymerize matrix!) measure fluorescent 
light returning: excites fluorophore 
Typically: 
- Oxygen present at tip q uenches fluorescence from tr apped fluorophore (ex., 
tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10 phenantroline) Ru(II) dichloride = Ru(dpp) 32+ Cl2) 
- Action of trapped oxidase (biological  element, ex., GOD) depletes O 2, causing 
 fluorophore emission 
Glucose 	+ O 2 + H 2O  Gluconic acid + H 2O2

How can we account for 
natural O 2 fluctuations? 
Multichannel fiber optic : 1. enhancing selectivity and/or 
2. multianalyte detection   
How can we measure multiple 
analytes?

Quartz crystal - Crystal vibrates at resonant biomolecules frequency parallel to applied 
field:

- A change in quartz mass (due  to adsorption) changes . 
Advantage:  high sensitivity-- 10s of nanograms/cm2 
Disadvantage: highly sensitive to nonspecific adsorption

- Implanted in peritonea l (abdominal) cavity 
- Membrane connected to vasc ulature by PTFE grafts 
- No exogenous insulin r equired for &gt; 10 weeks 
- Little fibrosis up to 30 weeks  (biocompatible acrylic) 
- Mechanisms of failure: 
a) membrane rupture (80-90% of devices by 5-7 mo.) 
b) thrombosis 
c) infection 
d) loss of islet functi on, islet necrosis 
 
 
 
 Human trials 1994 (Sharp &amp; Lacy) 
 
- Implanted subcutaneously 
- PAN-PVC hollow fiber (1.5 cm length)  
- Human islets in alginate matrix 
- 90-95% islet viability after 2 weeks  
 
 
Limitation:  Insulin quantityseveral meters of fiber for th erapeutic # of cells 
 Possible solutions:   
a) super cell lineshigh insulin  output, low nutrient needs 
b) advances in angiogenesis
