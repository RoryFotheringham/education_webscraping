computer literacy)
A good understanding of design 
and manufacturing processes (i.e. 
understands engineering)

High ethical standards
An ability to think both critically and creatively - independently and cooperatively
Flexibility. The ability and self-confidence to adapt to rapid or major change
Curiosity and a desire to learn for life
A profound understanding of the importance of teamwork.
This is a list, begun in 1994, of basic durable attributes 
into which can be mapped sp ecific skills reflecting the
diversity of the overall engineering environment in which
we in professional practice operate.  
This current version of the list can be viewed on the Boeing
web site as a basic message to those seeking advice from
the company on the topic.  Its contents are also included

Learning from Mistakes
-1.7 1.15Carrying out a full lifecycle creates 
memorable learning experiences
Dont prevent students from making mistakes
Example: bi-wing configuration
Excerpt from Student Reflective Memo:
I learned the value of cons tantly checking simulations 
against reality ..  My rear -wing design used a biplane 
setup, due to a huge ov ersight, the wings were 
actually arranged in an incorrect orientation which 
incurred a large drop in down force.  . This experience 
taught me a great lesson  a lways triple check your 
assumptions against your de sign.  I spent hours and 
hours optimizing a design that was never constructed , 
simply because I was told to assume that the down force bonus would be experienced .  I never bothered to 
verify this myself, and th is disconnection had dire 
consequences.</text>

Expectations
6 unit course (3-3-0)  7+1 sessions
TR1-5 in 33-218 , must attend all sessions or 
get permission of instructors to be absent
This is for-credit, no formal problem sets, 
but expect a set of deliverables (see   -list)
Have fun, but also take it seriously
The course is a 3rdyear prototype itself and 
we are hoping for your feedback &amp; 
contributions

Learning Objectives
At the end of this class yo u should be able to 
(1) Carry out a systematic design process from conception through
design/implementation/verification of a simple component or system.
(2) Quantify the predictive accuracy of CAE versus actual test results.
(3) Explain the relative improvement that computer optimization can
yield relative to an initial, manual solution.
(4) Discuss the complementary capabilities and limitations of the
human mind and  the digital computer ( synthesis versus analysis).</text>

-There is a perceived lack of understanding and training in 
modern design methods using state-of-the-art CAD/CAE/CAM 
technology and design optimization.

Bezier Curve
- The curve passes through the first and last vertex of the polygon.
-The tangent vector at the starting point of the curve has the same 
direction as the first segment of the polygon.
-The nth derivative of the curve at the starting or ending point is 
determined by the first or last ( n+1) vertices.Properties</text>

Advantages of NURBS Curve over B-Spline Curve
(1) More versatile modification capacity
- Homogeneous coordinate hi, which B-spline does not have, can change.
- Increasing hiof a control point Drawing the curve toward the control point.
(2) NURBS can exactly represent the conic curves - circles, ellipses, parabolas, and
hyperbolas  (B-spline can only approximate these curves)
(3) Curves, such as conic curves, Bezi er curves, and B-spline curves can be 
converted to their corresponding NURBS representations.</text>

Hermite Curves
* Most of the equations for curves used in CAD software are of degree 3 , because 
two curves of degree 3 guarantees 2nd derivative continuity at the connection point
The two curves appear to be one.
* Use of a higher degree causes small oscillations in curves and requires heavy 
computation.

(1) For complicated shape representation, higher degree Bezier curves are
needed. 
Oscillation in curve occurs, and computational burden increases.Two Drawbacks of Bezier curve
(2) Any one control point of the curve affects the shape of the entire curve.
Modifying the shape of a curve locally is difficult.
(Global modification property)
Desirable properties :
1. Ability to represent complicated shape with low order of the curve
2. Ability to modify a curves shape locally

Major Benefits of CAD
Productivity (=Speed) Increase
Automation of repeated tasks
Doesnt necessarily in crease creativity!
Insert standard parts (e.g . fasteners) from database
Supports Changeability
Dont have to redo entire  drawing with each change
EO  Engineering Orders
Keep track of previous design iterations
Communication
With other teams/engineers, e.g. manufacturing, suppliers
With other applications (CAE/FEM, CAM)
Marketing, realistic product rendering
Accurate, high quality drawings
Caution: CAD Systems produce errors with hidden lines etc

Parametric Equations 
Advantages over nonparametric forms
1. Parametric equations usually offer more degrees of freedom for 
controlling the shape of curves and surfaces than do nonparametric forms.
e.g. Cubic curve
32Nonparametric curve: ya x b x c x d=++ +32
32Parametric curve:   
                               xau bu cu d
ye u f u g xh=++ +
=++ +
3. Transformation can be performed directly on parametric equations
e.g. Translation in x-dir.

B-Spline Curve
Example
Order ( k) = 3 (first derivatives are continuous)
No of control points ( n+1) = 6
(1) The order of the curve is independent of the number  of control points (contrary to 
Bezier curves)
- User can select the curves order and  number of control points separately.
- It can represent very complicated shape with low order
(2) Modifying the shape of a curve locally is easy. (contrary to Bezier curve) 
- Each curve segment is affected by k (order) control points. (local modification property)Advantages</text>

Design Variables
For computational design optimization,
Objective function and cons traints must be expressed 
as a function of design variables (or design vector X)
Objective function: ( ) fx Constraints: ( ), ( ) ghxx
Cost = f(design)
Lift = f(design)
Drag = f(design)
Mass = f(design)What is f for each case?</text>
