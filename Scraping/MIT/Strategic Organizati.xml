          <text>Eight steps for organizational change   1.  Establish a sense of urgency  Identify potential crises or major opportunities. 5.  Empower others to act on vision  Remove obstacles (individual &amp; organizational). 2.  Form a powerful coalition  Assemble a group with enough power to lead change effort. 6.  Create short-term wins  Systematically plan for (and celebrate) early victories. 3.  Create a vision  Compelling, can be communicated in less than 5 minutes 7.  Consolidate and spread improvements  Don`t declare victory too soon. Keep spreading change. 4.  Communicate the vision  Communicate (by words and examples) ten  times more than you think you need. 8.  Institutionalize new approaches  Connect change to organizational culture and succession.

          <text>When is outsourcing useful?  Structure  Strengths  Weaknesses  
Outsourcing  Can take advantage of suppliers specialization: Economies of scale In-depth knowledge and skill Entrepreneurial motivation to excel on specialized task Lower capital investment required Many risks transferred to supplier  e.g., costs of development, weather, inventory, labor More flexibility  Can change components or suppliers more easily (e.g., in rapidly changing technologies or fashion goods) Can decrease design cycle times Can draw on much larger pool of potential innovations Foregone profit on outsourced activities Loss of critical skills internally May make future developments harder Coordination may be more difficult (and expensive) across firm boundaries Loss of control Supplier not necessarily motivated to take actions that are desirable for buyer  Supplier may be unwilling to make investments specific to a particular buyer Supplier may hold up buyer later Supplier may provide critical advantage to buyers competitors Supplier may directly compete with buyer  Copyright  2007 Thomas Malone.

If you know how to recognize and apply classic patterns of organizational design, you`ll be better able to implement strategies effectively in many situations.

Democratic voting  The knowledge, skills, and motivation needed to make a good decision are distributed widely.* The average voter is more likely to make a good decision than a bad one.*** Whoever controls the information needed to make good decisions is willing to share it with voters.* Everyone in the group needs to abide by the same decision.  (Otherwise individuals can just decide for themselves without a group vote.)** It is important for the voters to be committed to the  decision.  (They are more likely to feel committed to the decision if they had a chance to vote on it.) The average voter is more likely to make a bad decision than a good one.*** The voters` motivations are too divergent.  For instance, there is no satisfactory way to prevent: Gaming* Sabotage* There isn`t enough time (or enough of other resources) for everyone to become informed and then to vote. If votes are visible to others, then  early voters may have too much influence on decisions (linformation cascadesz) social pressures may have too much influence on decisions * Conditions shared with other forms of action by a Crowd ** Conditions shared with other forms of Group Decision *** See Condorcet Jury Theorem (described, for example, in Sunstein, 2006)  Copyright  2009 Thomas Malone.

New technologies  Cheap communication  Cheap transportation  
Cheap automation  For other physical and information tasks  More innovation  
More affluence  More education  More knowledge work  More globalization  More freedom  Intangible needs are more important  New ideas travel faster. Change is faster.  Innovation is more important.  More people can have more information and make more decisions for themselves.  People are more innovative when making decisions for themselves.  More tasks can be done anywhere in the world.  
Less need for people to do physical work.  People are more able to do knowledge work.  Basic needs are already met.  People are better at knowledge work when making decisions for themselves.

          <text>For what purposes are we  designing organizations?  Values that are not easily measured in economic terms are often important to many key stakeholders in organizations:  investors, customers, workers, and others. IT makes an organization`s actions about these values more visible to the world. Therefore: You have more opportunities to pursue non-economic values if you want to. You have to care more about your stakeholders` non-economic values, whether you want to or not.</text>

Internal Markets  Efficiency Maximizing your own benefits, results in efficient overall allocation (the invisible hand) Flexibility More information and minds applied to figuring out how to adjust Individual variation can be accommodated Motivation People are often more motivated and creative when they are rewarded directly for the results of their own actions Incentive problems Sometimes agreements that would be good overall arent in the individual interests of one or both parties involved. Communication Lots of communication usually needed to find and compare alternatives and to negotiate agreements.

          <text>Copyright  2011 Thomas Malone   Conclusions  All organizational patterns can be thought of in terms of 5 basic questions:  What, How, Who, Why, and When. There are a few very common patterns in how activities are grouped and linked in hierarachies. There are a few standard tradeoffs that help determine when these patterns  are appropriate. The details of who performs the activities and why they do so are more varied. For a pattern to work well, all its elements need to be aligned.</text>

          <text>When is democratic voting desirable?  
Structure  Favorable conditions  Unfavorable conditions  
Democratic 
voting  The knowledge, skills, and motivation needed to 
make a good decision are distributed widely.*  
The average voter is more likely to make a 
good decision than a bad one.***  
Whoever controls the information needed to make 
good decisions is willing to share it with voters.*  
Everyone in the group needs to abide by the same 
decision.  (Otherwise individuals can just decide for 
themselves without a group vote.)**  
It is important for the voters to be committed to the 
decision.  (They are more likely to feel committed to 
the decision if they had a chance to vote on it.)  The average voter is more likely to make a bad decision than 
a good one.***  
The voters motivations are too divergent.  For instance, 
there is no satisfactory way to prevent:  
Gaming*  
Sabotage*  
There isnt enough time (or enough of other resources) for 
everyone to become informed and then to vote.  
If votes are visible to others, then  
early voters may have too much influence on 
decisions (information cascades)  
social pressures may have too much influence on 
decisions  
 
* Conditions shared with other forms of action by a Crowd  
** Conditions shared with other forms of Group Decision

Structure  Strengths  Weaknesses  
Internal 
Markets  Efficiency 
Maximizing your own benefits, results in 
efficient overall allocation (the invisible 
hand) 
Flexibility 
More information and minds applied to 
figuring out how to adjust Individual variation can be 
accommodated 
Motivation 
People are often more motivated and 
creative when they are rewarded directly for the results of their own actions Incentive problems 
Sometimes agreements that would be good overall arent in the individual interests of 
one or both parties involved. 
Communication 
Lots of communication usually needed to 
find and compare alternatives and to negotiate agreements.

          <text>Copyright  2010  Thomas W. Malone.  All rights reserved. Why are internal markets 
becoming more desirable?  
Markets often have more efficient and flexible 
results than hierarchies. 
Markets can use more information and more 
people`s minds simultaneously than 
centralized hierarchies. 
IT lowers the costs of running markets and thus 
makes them more feasible in more situations.</text>
