          <text>3.3 Strong measurements 
3.3.1 Expectation values 
Although the result of a single measurement is probabilistic, we are usually interested in the average outcome, which 
gives us more information about the system and observable. The average or expectation value of an observable for a 
system in state |)is given by 
(A)= (|A|) 
? Question: Prove that this can be simply derived from the usual denition of average L L L L (A)= p(ak)ak = |(|ak)|2 ak = (|n)(n|)ak = (|( ak|k)(k|)|), and we get the desired result from A = L n n n n 
ak|k)(k|. n 
3.3.2 Uncertainty relationships 
D: Compatible Observables Two observables A, B are said to be compatible if their corresponding operatorscommute 
[A, B] = 0 and incompatible otherwise. 
D: Degeneracy If there exist two (or more) eigenstates of an operator A with the same eigenvalues, they are called 
degenerate. 
We have already seen how commuting operators have common eigenvectors and how a compatible observables can 
be used to distinguish between degenerate eigenvectors. We now look from a more physical point of view at the meaning of commuting (or compatible) observables. Suppose we rst measure A, given a state |). We retrieve e.g. 
the eigenvalue a and the state is now projected into the eigenstate |a). Allowing for the presence of degenerate 
eigenstates, we actually have a superposition state |)
Post-Meas = L
id 
=1 ci |a, bi), where d is the degree of degeneracy 
  of the eigenvalue a. We then measure B obtaining one of the bi, b. The state is thus projected into   a, b)
. If we now 
measure again A we will retrieve the same result as before: the two measurements of commuting observables A and 
B do not interfere. 
 Consider now non-commuting observables. As AB|)  BA|)we cannot dene a state   a, b) 
which is described = 
by the (separate) eigenvectors of the two observables. Also, if we repeat the same 3 successive measurements as 
above, we obtain a dierent result. In particular, the second measurement of A does not in general retrieve the same 
eigenvalue as the rst one. 
? Question: Show why measurement of non-commuting observables are not compatible.
 
Given a state |)we measure A, with result a. The state is now projected into the eigenstate |a)as before (we neglect here
 
degeneracy). Now we rewrite this state in the basis of the operator B (which is not the same as the basis for A, so |a)/
 {|bi)}): L |a)= ci(a)|bi). When we measure B we will therefore obtain an eigenvalue bi with probability |ci(a)|2, and the state is i 
Pi|a) |bi)(bi|a)projected into:  = = |bi). 
|(a|Pi|a)| ||a)(|bi)(bi|)(a||1/2 L Again, this can be written as a non-trivial superposition of eigenstates of A: |bi)= cj(bi)|aj)so that it is now possible to j 
obtain a measurement aj a when we again measure A. = 
D: Variance of an operator. We dene an operator A = A (A)for any observable A. The expectation value of its 
square is the variance of A: (

3.2.1 Observables and State Space 
A physical experiment can be divided into two steps: preparation and measurement. The rst step determines the 
possible outcomes of the experiment, while the measurement retrieves the value of the outcome. In QM the situation 
is slightly dierent: the rst step determines the probabilities of the variouspossible outcomes, while the measurement 
retrieve the value of a particular outcome, in a statistic manner. This separation of the experiment is reected into 
the two types of mathematical objects we nd in QM. The rst step corresponds to the concept of a state of the 
system, while the second to observables. The state gives a complete description of the set of probabilities for all observables, while these last ones are all dynamical variables that in principle can be measured. All the information is contained in the state, irrespectively on how I got the state, of its previous history. For the moment we will identify the state with the vectors of an Hilbert 
space |). We will see later on that a more general denition exists in terms of state operators . 
All physical observables (dened by the prescription of experiment or measurement ) are represented by a linear 
operator that operates in linear inner product space (an Hilbert space in case of nite dimensional spaces). States of 
the system are represented by the direction/ray (not a vector) in the linear inner product space (again Hilbert space 
in the nite dimensional case). 
3.2.2 Quantum measurement 
The value of the measurement of an observable is one of the observable eigenvalues. The probability of obtaining one 
particular eigenvalue is given by the modulus square of the inner product of the state vector of the system with the 
corresponding eigenvector. The state of the system immediately after the measurement is the normalized projection of the state prior to the measurement onto the eigenvector subspace. Let A be the observable with eigenvalues a
k and eigenvectors |k): A|k)= ak|k). Given a system in the state |), the 
probability of obtaining ak as the outcome of the measurement of A in this system is 
p(ak) = |(k|)|2 . 
We can also write this in terms of the kth eigenvector projector Pk = |k)(k|: p(ak) = (|Pk |). Since here we are con
sidering strong, projective measurement, also called Von Neumann measurements, immediately after a measurement that gave us the result a
k, the state of the system is in the |k)eigenstate. More precisely, the normalized output 
state after the measurement is 
Pk |)|  )= . 
|(|Pk|)| 
If we repeat the experiment after the rst measurement, we will obtain again the same result (with probability 1). If |)is an eigenstate of A, A|)= a
|), then we will measure a with probability unity. This is the well-known 
collapse of the wavefunction. 
The collapse of the wavefunction is of course a source of confusion and contradictions: as stated above it appears 
as an almost instantaneous evolution of the system from a given state to another one, an evolution which is not unitary (as evolution should be per axiom # 4). The source of contradiction stems from the fact that in this simple description of the measurement, the observer (or the measurement apparatus) are external to the system (thus the 
assumption of closed system is not respected) and might not even be quantum-mechanical. A more advanced theory of measurement attempts to solve these issues
6 . 
On the other side, we note that operationally the wavefunction collapse is required to dene a well-formulated 
theory. The collapse allows the experimenter to check the result of the measurement by repeating it (on the system 
just observed) thus giving condence on the measurement apparatus and procedure. If this were not the case, no measurement could be ever believed to be the correct one, so no conrmation of the theory could be done. Reference

This corresponds to the evolution matrix U: 
  
cos() sin() U = sin() cos() 
? Question: What are the eigenstates of U?
 
By diagonalizing the matrix, we nd the eigenvectors corresponding to right and left polarization:
 
R = ( 
|h)+ i |v))/ 2
L = (i |h 
)+|v))/ 2 
With eigenvalues e i and e i respectively. The evolution given by the polarization rotator is unitary. 
Now assume another experiment in which we alternate a polarizer rotator and an horizontal polarizer. First consider 
just a set of polarizer rotators, each described by the formula above: 
  
cos() sin() U() = sin() cos() 
After n of these rotators, the photon is rotated to U()n h= U(n)h= cos(n)h+ sin(n)v. Now if we

8 Zenos paradoxes are a set of problems (8 of which surviving) generally thought to have been devised by Zeno of Elea 
to support Parmenidess doctrine that all is one and that in particular, contrary to the evidence of our senses, motion is 
nothing but an illusion. The arrow paradox as related by Aristotle, (Physics VI:9, 239b5) states that The third is ... that 
the ying arrow is at rest, which result follows from the assumption that time is composed of moments ... . he says that if 
everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always in a now, the ying arrow is therefore motionless. To make the argument more similar to the QM version, we can rephrase it as: If you look at an arrow in ight, at an instant in time, it appears the same as a motionless arrow. Then how do we see motion?

3.3.3 Repeated measurements and Quantum Zeno Eect 
A. Photon Polarization Inthesamewayanelectromagneticwavecanbepolarized, also individualphotonspossessapolarization.Inparticular 
they can be in a state of linear or circular polarization (the most general case, is called elliptical polarization). We consider a photon polarizer. This can be thought as a lter that ensures photons coming out of it are only of the right polarization. 
 In-class demonstration with polarizer lters  
The photon polarizer(a polarization lter) is verysimilar to a measurementprocessand indeed it can be described by a projector. Lets assume that light can be described as either being in the horizontal hor vertical vpolarization. 
Then , for an horizontal polarizer, for example, we have P= h h. If we send a ph|
o)
H | )( | ton in the st|
at)
e through 
this linear (horizontal) polarizer, its state after the polarizer will be h. However the photon will emerg|
e )
only with 
a probability |(h |)|2. If we then send the photon to an orthogonal (|
ve)
rtical) polarizer PV = |v)(v|, the probability 
of a photon coming out is just zero. This situation is very similar to the case of repeated measurement. Thus the 
polarizer is a measurement process. 
Now lets send an horizontally polarized photon ( |h)) through a 45 degrees polarizer. This polarizer can be described 
by the projector operator P45 = |h + v)(h + v|/2. The state after the polarizer is then ( h + v /  
2, and the proba
bility of coming out is 1. If now we send this photon through a v vpolarizer, we obt|
ain as )
a nal state v, and 2the total probability is 1 /4 (compare to zero before).
 | )( | | )
We can extend this even further. Assume we have a large number of polarizers each ensuring a polarization at a
 growing angle, each in a small step  with the horizontal (that is, the rst polarizers angle is , the second 2  etc.).
 
The relevant projector is then
 
P
n() = (cos(n)|h)+ sin(n)|v))(cos(n)(h|+ sin(n)(v|). 
We start with a photon horizontally polarized |)0 = |h). After the rst polarizer, the photon emerges through in the 
state |)= cos |h)+sin |v)with probability p() = |(cos (h|+sin (v|)|h)|2 = cos2 1 1 . Nowpassingthroughthe 
second polarizer the photon will emerge again with probability cos2  and in the state 1 = cos(2)h+sin(2)v. 
After n polarizers, the state of the emerging photon is | ) | ) | )
|)n = cos(n)|h)+ sin(n)|v). 
Of course, we could get no photon at all, however the combined probability of getting a photon is cos( )2n 1 if 
the angle  is small and the number of polarizer n is large. Thus we obtain an evolution of the system by us 
ing a 
measurement process. 
B. Quantum Zeno eect 
We consider a photon polarization rotator, whose action is to rotate the polarization about the propagation axis. By 
denoting {h, v}the horizontal and vertical polarization, respectively, the polarization rotator achieves the following 
transformation:

          <text>3.2.3 Law of motion 
We can dene the time evolution operator U, such that 
|  )= U|), with UU = 1. 
Since the state has all the information about the system at time t, the state of the system at the time t +dt depends
 
only on the state at time t and on the evolution operator U(t, t + dt) (that thus depends only on the times t and
 
t + dt, not on any previous times, otherwise it would bring extra information to the system).
 
The unitarity of the evolution is equivalent to the following statement regarding the evolution of the state vector.
 
The dynamics of the system are generated by the system Hamiltonian H (the observable corresponding to the total
 
energy of the system), as described by Schr odinger equation:
 
diI | )= H|dt )
where I is the reduced Plancks constant7 (1.05451034 Js).
 
We would like to link this second statement (Schr odinger equation) to the previous statement regarding the unitarity
 
of the evolution. To do so we rst look at the evolution for an innitesimal time dt.
 
For an innitesimal evolution we have then: |(t + dt))= |) idtH|). It follows that U(t, dt) =11i dt. Since
 
the Hamiltonian is a self-adjoint operator, to the same order of approximation we retrieve the fact that 
U H
is unitary:
 
UU = (11iHdt)(11+iHdt) 11+o(dt2).
 
We can build the dynamics for any time duration in terms of innitesimal evolutions, U(t, t  ) = U(t  ,t  dt)...U(t +
 
2dt, t + dt)U(t + dt, t) since the propagator U depends only on the time t.
 
If the Hamiltonian is time independent (and setting t  = 0), we obtain: (t) = U(0,t)(0) , where the evolution
 
operator U is given by U = eiHt, i.e. U is an exponential operator.
 | ) | )
? Question: Show from the innitesimal time product and the Taylor expansion for the exponential that this is indeed the 
case. 
Equivalently, we can nd a dierential equation for the dynamics of the propagator: from U(t + dt, t0)U(t, t0) = 
i
KHU(t, t0) we have the Schr odinger equation for the time evolution operator (propagator): 
U iI = HU t 
This equation is valid also when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent (and we will see later on a formal solution to
 this equation).
 
As the Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system, its spectral representation is dened in terms of the
 
energLy eigenvalues 
k, with corresponding eigenvectors k: = k kk k. The evolution operator is then:
U = eikt| ) H | )( |
k |k)(k|. The eigenvalues of U are therefore simply eikL
t, and it is common to talk in terms of eigen
phases kt. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent we have also U = U(t), it is possible to obtain an eective 
inversion of the time arrow. 
? Question: What is the evolution of an energy eigenvector |k)?
 
First consider the innitesimal evolution: |k(t +dt))= U(t +dt, t)|k(t))= (11iHdt)|k(t))= (1ikdt)|k(t)). Thus we have
 
the dierential equation for the energy eigenket: d|k)= ik k, so that k(t) = e iktk(0) . We can also use the spectraldt 
decomposition of U: |k(t))= U(t, 0)|k(0))= (Le iht  | ) | ) | )
h |h)(h|)|k(0))= e ikt |k(0)).
In conclusion, our picture of QM is a mathematical framework in which the system is completely described by 
its state, which undergoes a deterministic evolution (and invertible evolution). The measurement process, which 
connects the mathematical theory to the observed experiments, is probabilistic. 
7 We will quite often set I = 1, that is, we will measure the energies in frequency units

3.1 Introduction 
Every physical theory is formulated in terms of mathematical objects. It is thus necessary to establish a set of 
rules to map physical concepts and objects into mathematical objects that we use to represent them5. Sometimes 
this mapping is evident, as in classical mechanics, while for quantum mechanics the mathematical objects are not 
intuitive. In the same way as classical mechanics is founded on Newtons law or electrodynamics on the Maxwell-
Boltzmann equations, quantum mechanics is also based on some fundamental laws, which are called the postulates 
or axioms of quantum mechanics. The axioms we are going to see apply to the dynamics of closed quantum systems. We want to develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of closed systems: therefore we are interested in dening states, observables, measurements and evolution. Some subtleties will arise since we are trying to dene measurement 
in a closed system, when the measuring person is instead outside the system itself. We give below (and explain in 
the next few sections) one formulation of the QM axioms. Dierent presentations (for example starting from density operators instead of state vectors) are possible. 
1. The properties of a quantum system are completely dened by specication of its state vector . The state 
vector is an element of a complex Hilbert space Hcalled the space of states. | )
2. With every physical property A(energy, position, momentum, angular momentum, ...) there exists an associated 
linear, Hermitian operator A (usually called observable), which acts in the space of states . The eigenvalues of 
the operator are the possible values of the physical properties. H

probability of obtaining ak as the outcome of the measurement of A is p(a2| )

the system is left in the state projected on the subspace of the eigenvalue a|( | )|

4. The evolution of a closed system is unitary. The state vector (t) at time t is derived from the state vector 
|(t0))at time t0 by applying a unitary operator U(t, t0), called|
the )
evolution operator: |(t))= U(t, t0)|(t0)).

has the desired property and we thus identify it with a coherent state.
The expectation values of position and momentum with respect to a coherent state give rise to the classical result.
However, when considering the expectation value of the energy, there are still two contributions: the rst one con-
tributes to the classical energy ( aa E=20), while the second term is a purely QM contribution (zero point
energy). The classical limit is reached
at higher|

9.1.3 Position representation
We have now started from a (physical) description of the h.o. Hamiltonian and made a change of basis in order to
arrive at a simple diagonal form of it. Now that we know its eigenkets, we would like to go back to a more intuitive
picture of position and momentum. We thus want to express the eigenkets |nan}backeti}htin terms of the position representation
(see also section 5.5.1).
/integraltextThe position representation corresponds to expressing a state vector |an}backeti}htin the position basis: |an}backeti}ht=dx x x =
dx(x)|xan}backeti}ht(where|xan}backeti}htis the eigenstate of the position operator that is a continuous variable, hence than}backetle{t

          <text>We see that in general px/planckover2pi1, with equality for n= 0: the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is a state of2minimum uncertainty. More ge
nerally, for any potential V(x), the ground state of a local minimum is always a state
of minimum uncertainty (since the potential can be always approximated by an harmonic potential).
We expect that higher energy states do not saturat e the uncertainty bound. Classically, when a system has some
nite energy, the particle is moving around so x= 2x0. At the minimum energy (that classically is 0), the particle
is at rest, localized ( x= 0). For the quantum h.o., even the minimum energy state is not localized, but rather it is
a gaussian packet (as described by 0(x)) thus the state does have some uncertainty in its position. Still, as expected
from the classical intuition, th/angbracketleftbigis u/angbracketrightbigncerta/angbracketleftbiginty is the minimum possible.
From the expectation values x2andp2/angbracketrightbig
we can calculate the average kinetic and potential energy. We nd that
the averagepotential and kinetic energy are the same, an}backetle{tTan}backeti}ht=an}backetle{tVan}backeti}ht=/planckover2pi1=an}backetle{tEan}backeti}ht/2, as for classical conservative systems4(virial theorem).
9.3 Coherent States
We now want to look at some connexion of the quantum h.o. with the classical one. We have seen that in the limit of
vanishing energy, the classical and quantum oscillators are very dierent, since the minimum energy for the quantum
h.o. is non-zero, while the classical h.o. is totally localized. On the opposite side, we saw that at high energy (high
n) the energy dierence between two levels vanishes,E=/planckover2pi1
/planckover2pi10; thus the energy becomes continuous, asE(n+1/2)
it would be in the classical case. Still, to nd a quantum-to-classical correspondence it is not enough to choose a
stationary eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with a high energy (high n): this state would still have zero expectation
value for the momentum and position. In contrast, the position evolution in classical mechanics is xcl=x0cost:
ideally we would like to nd a state |clan}backeti}htsuch that an}backetle{tx(t)an}backeti}ht=an}backetle{tcl(t)|x|cl(t)an}backeti}ht=xcl, as usually stated by Ehrenfest
theorem. Coherent states achieve this result. For this reasons, these states are also called quasi-classical.
The coherent state was dened by Roy J. Glauber32. He was looking for a superposition of eigenstates that looked
as classical as possible, without invoking any decoherence or the action of an external environment. The coherent
states are pure quantum states, however when we look at expectation values with respect to these states, the limit
of high energy we recover the classical results . For example, although the operator xandpdo not commute and
give rise to the known uncertainty relationships, when we consider the high energy limit of their expectation values
the uncertainties become a vanishing contribution.
Glauber idea was to introduce a complex classical variable =1(X+iP) (whereXandPare the dimensionless2
variables dened previously). The classical equations of motion for x and p dene the evolution of the variable :
dx p(t)dp=,=m2dx=i(t)dt m dt dt
The evolution of is therefore just a rotation in its phase space: (t) =(0)eit. This is usual for a conservative
system (in classical mechanics) or closed systems in QM. The initial conditions thus specify the overall evolution,
0=(0) contains all the important information.
SinceX= 2Re() andP=
2Im(), the expectation values for XandPoscillate, as usual in the classical case
(again, here XandPare just normalized, classical variable).
an}backetle{tXan}backeti}ht=1(0eit+0eit)2
an}backetle{tPan}backeti}ht=i( eit02
0eit)
The classical energy, given by /2(X2+P2) =2
0, is constant at all time.
Now consider the QM problem, where the variables are replaced by the corresponding operators:
1X= (a+a)/
2, P=i(aa)/
2,H=(aa+ ),2
and consider the evolution of the operator ain the Heisenberg picture. Its expectation value is given by

We now want to obtain an expression for the wavefunction representing a coherent state, that is, we want to nd the
x-representation of the coherent state: an}backetle{tx|an}backeti}ht. For this, we start from the equation

an}backetle{tx|p|an}backeti}ht=i/planckover2pi1x(x)
andan}backetle{tx|p|xan}backeti}ht=i/planckover2pi1x(xx) to obtain:

with solution 
2mxmx2(x) =Ae/planckover2pi1e2/planckover2pi1

          <text>9.4 Phonons
We have introduced the harmonic oscillator as an interesting model because of the energy level structure it gives rise
to. A second reason for its utility is that it can model many dierent systems around their equilibrium point. Here
we show how it can be used to describe vibrations in a crystal lattice and how the quantum-mechanical description
can be used to derive some of the lattice properties, such as its specic heat.
9.4.1 Harmonic oscillator model for a crystal
We consider a crystal formed by ions of mass Min a lattice (for simplicity we will consider a monoatomic, one-
dimensional lattice).
The ion equilibrium positions are Rn=nd, withdthe lattice constant, but the actual position of the ions is
rn=Rn+xn, wherexnis the displacement from the equilibrium.
The interaction potential among the ions is
1U=/summationdisplay 1U(rnrm) =/summationdisplay
U(Rn m2 2n,m nmR+xn
,xm)
Assuming the displacement xnis small, we can expand the potential as:
1 1U=/summationdisplay
U(RnRm)+/summationdisplay 1(x Rn x)22
nxm)U(Rm)+ (xn m (RnRm)2 2 4n,m n,m/summationdisplay
n,m U 
The rst term Ueq=1/summationtext
n,mU(RnRm) is the interaction potential at equilibrium, which is not of interest here.2
Consider the linear term:
1/summationdisplay 1(xnxm)U(RnRm) =/summationdisplay
xn/summationdisplay
[U(RnRm)U(RmRn)] =/summationdisplay
xn/summationdisplay
U(Rn2 2n,m n m n mRm)
The termm(RnRm) =Fnis the total force exerted on the atom nby all the other atoms. When all the
atoms are at equU
ilibriu
m, this force must be zero, since there can be no net force at equilibrium. We are then left
with only t/summationtext
he second order term:
1U=2/summationdisplay
(x2n
n,mxm)2
xU
If we assume that only neighboring ions interact, to second order, we retrieve an harmonic potential:
1U=K2/summationdisplay
(xn

Then, the Hamiltonian can be written as:

while the equation of motion for each oscillator is:

          <text>by this model is solid-state crystals, where the oscillations of nuclei in the lattice can be described as a systems of
coupled oscillators (phonons).
Notice that any potential with a local minimum can be locally described by an h.o.. Provided that the energy is low
enough (or xclose tox0), any potential can in fact be expanded in series, giving: V(x)V(x0)+b(x
2x0)2+...
whereb=d V
dx2|x0.
9.1.2 Oscillator Hamiltonian: Position and momentum operators
We can dene the operators associated with position and momentum. They are two observables ( p,x) with the
commutation properties: [x,p ] =i/planckover2pi1. With these two operators, the Hamiltonian of the quanutm h.o. is written as:
p2kx2p21H= + = + m2x2,2m2 2m2
where we dened a parameter with units of frequency: =k/m.
We use the dimensionless variables,pP=/radicalbig
, X=xmm
  andH=H/, to simplify the expression to H=(X2+P2)/2 orH=(X2+P2).2 We have said initially that we expect the hamiltonian to have the form = ( n+1)n n, if expressed in an2appropriate basis. This simply corresponds to diagonalizing the HamiltonH
ian (thus the|
baan}backeti}ht
san}backetle{t
is|
nis the energy
basis, or the basis formed by the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian). However the diagonalization is{|
noan}backeti}ht
t}
as intuitive as
for simple TLS (or n TLS) because we are considering a system with innite dimensions.
 The operator H= (n+1)|nan}backeti}htan}backetle{tn|is our guess for the diagonalized form of the Hamiltonian, which makes explicit the2presence of energy levels, labeled by n. Correspondingly, there must be operators that act on the ladder of energy
levels. For example, the fundamental operations possible are the raising or lowering of 1 quantum of energy, as well
as an operator giving the number of energy quanta: N|nan}backeti}ht=n|nan}backeti}ht. The raising and lowering operators act as the
following:a|nan}backeti}ht  |n1an}backeti}htanda|nan}backeti}ht  |n+1an}backeti}ht. They are also called the annihilation and creation operators, as they
destroy or create a quantum of energy.
Instead of deriving rigorously these operators, we guess their form in terms of the XandPoperators:
a=1x21
/planckover2pi1(X+iP) = 2/planckover2pi1(m+ip)m
a=1
/planckover2pi1(X2iP) =1
2/planckover2pi1(mxip),m
and we will check a posteriori that indeed they act as annihilation and creation operators. Notice that a,aare not
hermitian, but they are one the hermitian conj/bracketleftbigugate/bracketrightbigof the other ( a= (a)). Also, we dene the number operator
asN=aa. The commutation properties are: a,a= 1 and [N,a ] =a,/bracketleftbig
N,a/bracketrightbig
=a.
Also we have:
x=/radicalig
/planckover2pi1
/radicalig(a+a)2m
p=im/planckover2pi1(aa)2
?Question: Prove the commutation relationships of the raising and lowering operators.
[a,a1 1 i i] = [X+iP,XiP] = ([X, iP]+[iP,X]) = [X,P] = [x,p] = 12/planckover2pi1 2/planckover2pi1 /planckover2pi1/planckover2pi1
So we also have aa= [a,a]+aa= 1+aa= 1+N.
[N,a] = [aa,a] = [a,a]a=aand [N,a] = [aa,a] =a[a,a] =a
Notice that from now on we will take as usual /planckover2pi1= 1.

9.4.3 Thermal energy density and Specic Heat
We want to rst calculate the thermal energy density u=E/Vand then the specic heat, cV=ufor a crystal atTthermal equilibrium.
The thermal energy is given by the lattice vibration. Thus we want to calculate:
an}backetle{tEan}backeti}ht= Tr{H}
with the Hamiltonian given above. The system in thermal equilibrium is described by the usual distribution:

          <text>9.1.4 Heisenberg picture
We want now to study the time-evolution of the h.o. We rst start with analyzing the evolution of the operators in
the Heisenberg picture. We have
da 1=i[H,a] =i[(aa+ ),a] =iaa(t) =a(0)eit
dt 2
Similarly:
da1=i[H,a] =i[(aa+ ),a] =iaa(t) =a(0)eit
dt 2
Notice that we could have found this last relationship just by taking the hermitian conjugate of the rst one.
Using these results, we can also nd the time evolution of the position and momentum operators:
p(0)x(t) =x(0)cos(t)+ sin( t)m
p(t) =p(0)cos(t)mx(0)sin(t)
and the corresponding expectation values, e.g.
p(0)an}backetle{tx(t)an}backeti}ht=an}backetle{tx(0)an}backeti}htcos(t)+an}backetle{t an}backeti}htsin(t)m
9.1.5 Schr odinger picture
An initia/summationtextl state can be expressed in terms of the number eigenvectors: |an}backeti}ht=ncn|nan}backeti}ht. Then its evolution is simply:
|(t)an}backeti}ht=ncneint|nan}backeti}ht. From this expression, one can calculate e.g./summationtext

Sincexonly connects states that dier by nm=1, its easy to see that the double sum simplies and we retrieve
the expression above, found in the Heisenberg picture.
9.2 Uncertainty relationships
The operators xandpfor a quantum h.o. do not commute, so they do not share any eigenstate, nor they share
eigenstates with the Hamiltonian. In particular the diagonal elements of x and p in the n-basis representation are
both zero, therefore the expectation values are also zero. In a series of measurements, it is| an}backeti}ht
possible to get a range of
values; we associate this dispersion of values with the root mean square value of the eigenvalues:

the deviations are just: x=an}backetle{tx2an}backeti}htandp=an}backetle{tp2an}backeti}htand the uncertainty relation can be expressed by:

9.1 Harmonic Oscillator
We have considered up to this moment only systems with a nite number of energy levels; we are now going to
consider a system with an innite number of energy levels: the quantum harmonic oscillator (h.o.).
The quantum h.o. is a model that describes systems with a characteristic energy spectrum, given by a ladder of
evenly spaced energy levels. The energy dierence between two consecutive levels is E. The number of levels is
innite, but there must exist a minimum energy, since the energy must always be positive. Given this spectrum, we
expect the Hamiltonian will have the form
H|nan}backeti}ht=/parenleftbigg1n+2/parenrightbigg
/planckover2pi1|nan}backeti}ht,
where each level in the ladder is identied by a number n. The name of the model is due to the analogy with
characteristics of classical h.o., which we will review rst.
9.1.1 Classical harmonic oscillator and h.o. model
A classical h.o. is described by a potential energy V=1kx2. If the system has a nite energy E, the motion is bound2
2by two values x, such that V(x) =E. The equation of motion is given by md x0 0 2=kxand the kinetic energy isdx
of courseT=1mx2=p2. The energy is constant since it is a conservative system, with no dissipation. Most of the2 2 mtime the particle is in the position x0since there the velocity is zero, while at x= 0 the velocity is maximum.
The h.o. oscillator in QM is an important model that describes many dierent physical situations. We will study
in depth a particular system described by the h.o., the electromagnetic eld. Another system that can be described

          <text>9.3.2 Non-Orthogonality
The coherent states |an}backeti}htdo not form a proper basis, since they are eigenvectors of a non-hermitian operator. In
particular they are not orthogonal (even if they are normalized by the choice of c0):

an}backetle{t | an}backeti}ht/summationdisplay(||2+||2)/2n m2 2 2 2  =e () / n!m!an}backetle{tn|man}backeti}ht=e(||+||)/2/summationdisplay

Although not orthogonal, their superposition goes to zero as || 0, since
|an}backetle{t | an}backeti}ht|2(||2+||2  =e2 )/2e(||2+||22)/2=e||2
Also, the set of coherent states is complete:
|an}backeti}htan}backetle{t|d/=11
Because of this closure relation, any state can be/integraldisplay
written in terms of coherent state superposition, thus the coherent
states form an overcomplete basis.

and for example:
X21 1= [(2+()2+2+1)(+)2] =2 2
We then have X2=1andP2=1so that the uncertainty relationship is saturated:2 2

The coherent state is thus a minimum uncertainty state (as the number states were).

The classical oscillator model is solved by guessing a solution in terms of waves (normal modes of the oscillation):
x(t)eikRneiktk
This solution is motivated by the translation symmetry of the lattice. We can check that the solution we guessed is
the correct one, by inserting it in the equation of motion
UMxn=xn M2
kxn=K[2xxx] =Kx[2eikdeikd

Thus if we set 2
k=K2[1cos(kd)] the equation is veried. The relationship:M

This solution describes waves propagating in the chain with phasevelocityc=/kandgroupvelocityv=g(thekspeed of sound in the given material). At small kthe two velocities are equal, but for large k(small spacing between

5.5 The wave-function 
We have so far considered systems associated to observableswith a discrete spectrum. That is, the system can assume 
only a discrete number of states (for example 2, for the TLS) and the possible outcomes of an experiments are a 
discrete set of values. Although for the rst part of the class this is all that well need, its important to introduce as 
well systems with a continuous set of states, as they lead to the concept of a particles wave function12. This is an 
essential concept in non-relativistic QM that you might has seen before (and probably as one of the very rst topics in QM). 
5.5.1 Position representation 
The state |)of a point-like particle is naturally expanded onto the basis made of the eigenstates of the particles 
position vector operator R. Of course the position of a point particle is a continuous variable (more precisely a vector 
whose components are the three commuting coordinate operators X, Y and Z). The rigorous mathematics denition 
of these continuous basis states is somewhat complex, so we will skip some of the details to instead obtain a practical description of the wave function. The basis states |r)satisfy the relations generalizing the orthonormality conditions: 
r|r 
 )= (r r  ), 1 
d3 r|r)r|=11 
where (r r  ) is the three-dimensional Dirac function. Developing |)in the |r)basis yields: 
|)= 1 
d3 r|r)r|) 
where we dene the wave function (in the position representation) 
(r) = r|) 
The shape of the wave function depends upon the physical situation under consideration. we may say that the 
wave function describes the state of the particle suspended, before measurement, in a continuous superposition 
of an innite number of possible positions. Upon measurement of R performed with a linear precision r, this 
superposition collapses into a small wave packet of volume ( r)3 around a random position r, with the probability 
p(r) = |r|)|2(r)3 . 
5.5.2 Momentum representation 
The position representation is suited for measurements of the particles position. If one is interested in the particle 
momentum P or velocity V = P/m (where m is the particle mass) it is appropriate to choose the momentum 
12 For a nice introduction to these concepts, see S. Haroche, J.-M. Raimond, Exploring the quantum: atoms, cavities and 
photons, Oxford University Press (2006). In this section we follow their presentation closely.

          <text>B. Suzuki-Trotter expansion 
Another useful approximation is the Suzuki-Trotter expansion11. To rst order this reads: 
A+B A/n B/n)n e = lim (e e
n
Suzuki-Trotter expansion of the second order: 
A+B A/(2n)B/n A/(2n ))n e = lim (e e e
n
In general we can approximate the evolution under a time-varying Hamiltonian by a piecewise constant Hamiltonian 
in small enough time intervals: 
U(t, t0) = U(t, tn1)...U(t2,t1)U(t1,t0), t 0 &lt;t1 &lt;t2 &lt;  &lt;tn1 &lt; t, 
where we usually take tk tk1 = t and consider the Hamiltonian H to be constant during each of the small time 
interval t. 
C. Magnus expansion 
The Magnus expansion is a perturbative solution to the exponential of a time-varying operator (for example the propagator of a time-varying Hamiltonian). The idea is to dene an eective time-independent Hamiltonian by 
J 
i dt  H(ttaking: U = Te 0 t  )  eitH . The eective Hamiltonian is then expanded in a series of terms of increasing 
(0) (1) (2) order in time H = H+ H+ H+ ..., so that 
(0) (1) (2) U = exp{it[H+ H+ H+ ...]} 
J i dt  H(t0 where the terms can be found by expanding Tet  ) and equating terms of the same time power. In order to 
keep the time order, commutators are then introduced. The lowest order terms are 
1  tH(0) = H(t  )dt  
t 0  i  t  tH(1) =  dt  dt  [H(t  ),H(t  )] 2t 0 0   (2) 1  t  t  tH= dt  dt  dt  {[[H(t  ),H(t  )],H(t  )]+ [[H(t  ),H(t  )],H(t  )]}6t 0 0 0 
The convergence of the expansion is ensured only if Ht  1.

quantities we are interested in and have access to).
 
From the evolution law for a state, |)  |  ) = U|), we obtain the following relation, when expressing the state
 
in the Hamiltonian eigenbasis:

Quite generally, we can also write A(t) = (t)A (t) = (U)A U. By the associative property we then 
write A(t)) = |(UAU)|.  )  | | )  | | )
It would than seem natural t)
o dene an evolved observable A(t) = UAU, from which we can obtain expectation

in terms of observables in the Schr odinger picture as 
H  A(t) = U(t)ASU(t), AH (0) = AS 
The state kets coincide at t = 0: H = (t = 0)S and they remain independent of time. Analogously to the
Schr odinger equation we can dene |

? Question: Derive the Heisenberg equation from the Schr odinger equation. 
H SdA d(U A U )  = = UASU + UAS U = i(UH)ASU + UAS(iHU). Inserting the identity 1 1 = UU we have = dt dt t t 
i(UHH UUASU  UASUUHU). We dene HH = UHU. Then we obtain dA= i[AH , HH]. U and H always comdt 
mute for time-independent H, thus HH = H. 
5.2 Interaction Picture 
We now consider yet another picture that simplies the description of the system evolution in some special cases. 
In particular, we consider a system with an Hamiltonian 
H = H0 + V 
where calculaH
0 is a solvable Hamiltonian (of which we already know the eigen-decomposition, so that it is easy to 
te e.g. UiH0 t0 = e) and V is a perturbation that drives an interesting (although unknown) dynamics. In the 
so-called interaction picture the state is represented by 
|)= U(t)|)= e iH0 tI 0S |)S 
where the subscript I,S indicate the interaction and Schr odinger picture respectively. For the observable operators 
we can dene the corresponding interaction picture operators as: 
AI (t) = U0 AS U0  VI (t) = U0VU0
We can now derive the dierential equation governing the evolution of the state in the interaction picture (we now drop the subscript S for the usual Schr odinger picture): 
 
I (U) U  i | )= i 0| )= i( + U | )) = U
0+ U(0 + V )= UV  .t t t | )0t 0H | )0H | ) 0| )

          <text>Now we can rewrite the expression above in a more compact way. We replace the limits of each intervals so that 
they span the whole duration {0,t}and we divide by n! to take into account that we integrate over a larger interval. 
Then we can write the products of integrals as powers and use the time-ordering operator to take this change into account. We then have:  
(i)n (1 t )n

where we recognize the expression for an exponential

5.2.2 Some useful approximate formulas 
Besides the formal solution found above and the Dyson series formula, there are other approximate formulas that can help in calculating approximations to the time evolution propagator. 
A. Baker-Campbell-Hausdor formula 
AThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdor formula gives an expression for C = log(e eB ), when A, B do not commute. That 
C Ais, we want C such that e= e eB . We have10 
1 1 1 C = A + B + [A, B]+ ([A, [A, B]] [B, [A, B]])  [B, [A, [A, B]]] ... 2 12 24
The Hadamard series is the solution to f(s) = esABesA. To nd this, dierentiate the equation: 
sA f  (s) = e sAABesA e sABAesA = e sA[A, B]e 
 (s)sA sA f = e sAA[A, B]e e sA[A, B]AesA = e sA[A, [A, B]]e 
 (s)sA f = e sA[A, [A, [A, B]]]e 
etc. and then construct the Taylor series for f(s): 
f(s) = f(0)+sf  (0)+ 1 s 2f  (0)+ 1 s 3f  (0)+... 2 3! 
to obtain 
1 12 3 sABesA e = B +[A, B]s + [A, [A, B]]s + [A, [A, [A, B]]]s + ... 2 3!
Withs = it and A = H,this formulacanbeusefulin calculatingtheevolutionof anoperator(either inthe Heisenberg 
or interaction representation or for the density operator).

          <text>5.4 Examples: Resonance of a Two-Level System 
We have looked at the precession of the spin at the Larmor frequency, which happens if the spin is initially in a 
superposition state. However, the question remained on how we rotate initially the spin away from its equilibrium 
state pointing along the large external magnetic eld. Consider then a more general problem in which we add a 
(small) time-dependent magnetic eld along the transverse direction (e.g. x-axis): 
BB(t) = Bzz+2B1 cos(t)x = Bz z+ B1 [(cos(t)x + sin(t)y)+(cos(t)x sin(t)y)], 
where B1 is the strength of the radio-frequency (for nuclei) or microwave (for electron) eld. 
The Hamiltonian of the system H = H0 + H1(t)+H1 (t) is then: 
0 1 1H = z + [cos(t)x + sin(t)y ]+ [cos( t)x sin(t)y],2 2 2 
where we dened the rf frequency 1. We already know the eigenstates of H0 (|0)and |1)). Thus we use the 
iz interaction picture to simplify the Hamiltonian, with U0 = e/2 dening a frame rotating about the z-axis 
 at a frequency : this is the so-called rotating frame . Remembering that U0xU= cos(t)x + sin(t)y , its0 
easy to see that the perturbation Hamiltonian in the interaction frame is H1I = UH1U0 = 
01x. We also have2 
 H  = UH1 U0 = 1I 1(cos(2t)x sin(2t)y). Under the assumptions that 1  , this is a small, fast oscillating0 2 term, that quickly averages out during the evolution of the system and thus can be neglected. This approximation is 
called the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Under the RWA, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame simplies to 
 1HI = z + x2 2 
where  = 0 . Notice that if  is large (  1), we expect that the eigenstates of the systems are still going 
to be close to the eigenstates of H0 and the small perturbation has almost no eect. Only when   0 we will see 
a change: this is the resonance condition. In particular, for  = 0 the new Hamiltonian  x will cause a spin 
initially in, say, |0)to rotate away from the z axis and toward the y axis. This is how a pulse is generated e.g. in 
NMR or ESR pulsed spectroscopy. For example, if the B1 eld is turned on for a time t/2 = /21 we prepare the 
state |)= (|0) i|1))/ 2 that will then precess at the Larmor frequency, giving a spectroscopic signature in the 
recorded signal. We want to study the Hamiltonian in the general case. Given the matrix representation 
1 ( 
 1 )
HI = 2 1  
we can nd the eigenvalues: 
 I =  V
1+(1/)2 . 2 
There are two interesting limits, on resonance ( = 0) where I = 1 and far o resonance (   1) where 
I    0. The eigenstates are found (e.g. via a rotation of the Hamiltonian) to be 
|+)= cos|0)+ sin|1)I 
|)= cos|1)sin|0),I 
with V

I +  sin = , cos = 2I 2I 
Consider the evolution of the state |0)under the rotating frame Hamiltonian. At time t = 0 the two frame coincide, 
so |)I = |)= |0). The state then evolves as

where we introduced the velocity vk = (xk xk1)/t. The probability amplitude for the system to go from xt  i o 
xf in time t is thus a sum of amplitudes one for each possible classical path - whose phase is the systems action  
S = 
Ldt along the trajectory, where L = 1 mv2 V (x) = mv2 H is the Lagrangian of the system. This phase is 2expressed in units of n.
 
We have derived this important result by admitting the Schr odinger equation formalism of quantum mechanics.
 
Feynman proceeded the other way around, postulating that a quantum system follows all the classical trajectories
 
with amplitudes having a phase given by the classical action and has derived from there Schr odinger s equation.
 
At the classical limit S/n  1, the phase along a trajectory evolves very fast when the path is slightly modied,
 
by changing for instance one of the xj . The amplitudes of various neighboring paths thus interfere destructively,
 
leaving only the contributions of the trajectories for which the phase, hence the action, is stationary. If the particles
 action in units of n is much larger than 1, the particle follows a classical ray. Suppressing the contributions to the
 
amplitude coming from trajectories far from the classical one does not appreciably aect this amplitude.

5.4.1 Dressed states and AC Stark shift 
This Hamiltonian is also used in Atomic physics to describe the ground and (one) excited levels coupled by an 
external e.m. eld (for example in the visible spectrum). The evolution of an atom in an e.m. eld (here we are considering a classical e.m. eld, but we will see that we can also consider the quantized version) is usually described with the dressed atom picture. This picture (due to Cohen-Tannoudji) describes the atom as dressed by a cloud of 
virtual photons, with which it interacts. This atomic TLS has (unperturbed) eigenstates |e)= |0)and |g)= |1)with energies E
0  E1 = , which are 
coupled through an interaction 1/2. When we consider the optical transition of an atom we usually call 1 the Rabi 
frequency. 
 The coupling mixes these states, giving two new eigenstates as seen before with energies I = V
1+(1/)2 ,2 which is called the eective Rabi frequency.

If the coupling is small, we can treat it as a perturbation, and the energies are just shifted by an amount E = 1 
4 . 
 
   2
That is, the new energies are E= (1+ 10 2 ). This shift in the context of a two-level atom dressed by the e.m. 2 2eld is called the AC Stark shift . It is a quadratic eect that can be seen also as arising (in a more general context)
 
from second order perturbation theory.
 
The perturbed energies are shown in the following diagram. Here we explore the range of the eigenvalues I =
 
found before, given a xed value of the coupling 1 and a varying splitting  between the two levels. In r
ed are
 
the two perturbed energies, while the dashed lines follow the unperturbed energies. For  = 0, in the absence of
 
a coupling term, the two eigenstate are degenerate. The perturbation lifts this degeneracy, giving rise to an avoided
 
crossing. The eigenstates are a complete mix of the unperturbed states, yet remain split in energy by the strength
 
of interaction 1.

A simple system could be describing a single partic

In the momentum representation, we  obtain the wave function (p) = (p). We can as well describe this state in

i)Hint: Show that the momentum generates translations in x and consider an innitesimal translation. 
ii)Hint: Show that [P x n x,f( )] = i xf(x). 
ipxx/n 1) We start from (px|x)= e 
:1/2 . Then we have for any translation a (2)
(p|x + a)  e ipx(x+a)/: ip:xa/
x = e (px|x) 
We thus recognized p as the generator of translation and the corresponding propagator U(a) = e ip a/:x. In the Heisenberg 
picture, we can thus show U(a)xU(a) = x +a11, since |)we have 
(|U(a)xU(a)|)= ( + a|x | + a)= (x)+ a. 
Now we consider an innitesimal translation a. The propagator then becomes U(a)  11  ipxa/n. Calculating again 
U(a)xU(a) = x + a11, we obtain: 
   ia a2p 2ia x + a11= (11+ ipxa/n)x(11ipxa/n) = x + (px xp)+ = x +2
n  [x, p]O(a)n2 n 
 Neglecting terms in a2we thus proved the commutation relationship [ x, p] = in11.
 
2) Now we start from the commutation relationship [ x, p] = in and we calculate [ x n ,p]. We start from the lower powers:
 
 2  [x ,p] = x[x, p]+[x, p]x = 2i3p] = x[x 2nx; [x , ,p ]+[x, p]x 2= 3i2 nnx ; [x ,p] = nin1nx 
Lets now consider any function of x and its commutator with p. Since by denition we can expand the function in a power 
series, it is easy to calculate the commutator: 
n  f(x)[f(x),p] =  
f(n)(0)/n![x n ,p] =  
f(n)(0) in1nx = in n! x n n 
Notice that this is also true for the wave function: [ px,p(x)] = inxp(x) = p(x|p)(x|p)p= pp(x) from which, solving 
ip x/nthe dierential equation, (p|x)= e x
x:1/2 (where the denominator is chosen to have a normalized function). (2)

          <text>5.3 Spin-1
2 precession 
We consider the semi-classical problem of a spin-1/2 particle in a classical magnetic eld. To each spin with spin 
angular momentum J is associated a magnetic moment  = S where  is called the gyromagnetic ratio, a property 
of each spin-carrying particle (nucleus, electron, etc.). The energy of the system in an external mangetic eld is 
(classically) given by  B, where B is of course the eld. Thus, the system Hamiltonian is simply = BzSz = Sz, 
where we take the z axis to point along the external eld for simplicity and we dened the LarmoH 
r frequency for the 
given system. 
If the spin is initially in the state |0), the system does not evolve (as it is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian). If instead 
it is prepared in a superposition state, it will undergo an evolution. 
|0)= 0|0)+ 0|1)  |(t))= (t)|0)+ (t)|1) 
? Question: What are the functions (t), (t)? 
1. As |0), |1)are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with eigenvalues /2, we know that their evolution is just a phase e it/2, 
so that (t) = it/2 +it/2 
0e and (t) = 0e . 
2. |(t))= U(t)|(0)), with U = e iHt = e iSzt= 11cos(t/2)i sin(t/2)2Sz. Then U(t)|0)= (cost/2i sin t/2)|0)= 
e it/2|0)and we nd the same result. 
? Question: What is the probability of nding the spin back to its initial state? 
  Lets write theinitial state as |)0 = cos(/2)|0)+ei/2sin(/2)|1).Thenthe evolutionis eit/2cos(/2)|0)+e i(t+)/2sin(/2)|1
    ) 
and the probability p = cos 2(t/2)+cos 2sin2(t/2) In particular, for  = /4 we have cos2(t/2) (notice that this is an 
eigenstate of the Sx operator).

We want to calculate (Sx(t)). We can use the Heisenberg picture, and calculate USxU = Sx cos(t)Sy sin(t). Thus we see
 
that the periodicity is T = 2
 while it was 4
 for the spin state (spinor behavior). Then we know that (Sx)= cos(/2)sin()

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
The evolution of the magnetization is what is usually detected in NMR. The precession of the spin in a large static 
magnetic eld creates an oscillating magnetic eld that in turns generate a current/voltage in a pickup coil. Fourier
transform of the signal gives spectroscopic information regarding the Larmor frequency; local modication of the magnetic eld (due e.g. to electronic eld) induces a variation on the Larmor frequency of each nuclear spin in a molecule, thus providing a way to investigate the structure of the molecule itself. Before we can have a full vision of 
a (simple) NMR experiment, we still need to answer the question on how we rst prepare the spin in a superposition 
state (e.g. in a S
x eigenstate). We will be able to answer this question in a minute.

In a previous lecture we characterizedthe time evolutionofclosed quantum systems as unitary, |(t))= U(t, 0)|(0)
and the state evolution as given by Schr odinger equation: ) 
dii | )= H|dt )
Equivalently, we can nd a dierential equation for the dynamics of the propagator: 
U ii = HU t 
This equation is valid also when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent.
 
As the Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system, its spectral representation is dened in terms of the
 
energLy eigenvalues k, with corresponding eigenvectors |k): H = L
k k
ikt ikt|k)(k|. The evolution operator is then:
U = k e|k)(k|. The eigenvalues of U are therefore simply e, and it is common to talk in terms of eigen
phases k(t) = kt. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent we have also U = U(t), it is possible to obtain an 
eective inversion of the time arrow. 
? Question: What is the evolution of an energy eigenvector |k)?
 
First consider the innitesimal evolution: |k(t +dt))= U(t +dt, t)|k(t))= (11iHdt)|k(t))= (1ikdt)|k(t)). Thus we have
 
the dierential equation for the energy eigenket: d|k)= ik |k), so that |k(t))= e ikt
dt |k(0)).
We can also use the spectral decomposition of U: |k(t))= U(t, 0)|k(0))= (L
h e iht |h)(h|)|k(0))= e ikt|k(0)).
Notice that if a system is in a state given by an eigenvector of the Hamiltonian, then the system does not evolve. This is because the state will only acquire a global phase that, as seen, does not change its properties. Of course, superposition of energy eigenkets do evolve. 
5.1 The Schro dinger and Heisenberg pictures 
Until now we described the dynamics of quantum mechanics by looking at the time evolution of the state vectors. This approach to quantum dynamics is called the Schr odinger picture. We can easily see that the evolution of the

This is a Schr odinger -like equation for the vector in the interaction picture, evolving under the action of the operator 
VI only. However, in contrast to the usual Schr odinger picture, even the observables in the interaction picture evolve 
in time. From their denition AI (t) = U0AS U0, we have the dierential equation dAI = i[0,AI ], which is andt Heisenberg-like equation for the observable, with the total Hamiltonian replaced by H
H0. The interaction picture is 
thus an intermediate picture between the two other pictures.

Table 1: Time dependence of states and operators in the three pictures 
5.2.1 Dyson Time-ordering operator 
If we now want to solve the state-vector dierential equation in terms of a propagator |(t))I = UI (t)|)I , we
encounter the problem that the operator VI is usually time-dependent since VI (t) = U0 VU0, thus in general UI= 
eiVIt. We can still write an equation for the propagator in the interaction picture 
dUIi = VI (t)U Idt
with initial condition UI (0) = 11. When VI is time dependent and VI (t) does not commute at dierent time, it 
is no longer possible to nd a simple explicit expression for UI (t). Indeed we could be tempted to write UI (t) = Jt ei V I(t  )dt  0. However in general 
eAe B A +B = e if [A, B] = 0,
thus for example, although we know that UI (t) can be written as UI (t, 0) = UI (t, t )UI (t  , 0) (0 &lt;t  &lt;t) we have 
that J  it V(t  )dt  Ii e 0 Jt V(t  I)dt
  t = ei Jt V(t  )dt  iJt V(t  )dt  
 I Ite 0 . Thus we cannot nd an explicit solution in terms of an
 
integral.
 
We can however nd approximate solutions or formal solution to the evolution.
 
The dierential equation is equivalent to the integral equation

UI (t) =11i1

By iterating, we can nd a formal solution to this equation :

This series is called the Dyson series.
 
Note that in the expansion the operators are time-ordered, so that in the product the operators at earlier times are
 
at the left of operators at later times. We then dene an operator T such that when applied to a product of two
 
operators it will return their time-ordered product:
 
 
A(t)B(t  ), if t&lt;t  
T(A(t)B(t  )) = {

          <text>5.5.3 Schrodinger equation for the wavefunction 
We have studied already the law governing the evolution of a quantum system. We saw that the dynamics of the 
system is generated by the system Hamiltonian H (the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system), 
as described by Schr odinger equation: 
ind|)= H|)dt 
We can express this same equation in the position representation. We want to describe the evolution of a point 
P 2 particle in a potential V (r) and with kinetic energy T = . The Hamiltonian of this simple system is thus given by2m 
2 pH = V (r)+ . By multiplying the Schr odinger equation with the bra r|we obtain:2m 
indr|) P 2 
= int(r) = r|H|)= r|V (r)|)+ r| |)dt 2m
Using the relationship 
2 22(x, t)x|P 2|)= (P 2)(x, t) = (inx)(x, t) = n ,x x x 
we obtain 
2(r,t) n in =  (r,t)+V (r,t)(r,t)t 2m 
(where is the Laplacian operator in 3D). 
5.6 Feynmans path-integral 
The formal solution of the Schr odinger equation above can be written as |(t))= U(t, 0)|(0)). Using the position 
representation and the closure relation  
d3r|r)r|= 11 we can write 
  (r,t) = 1 
d3 r r|U(t, 0)|r  )(r , 0), 
iHt/:where U(t, 0) = eand the matrix element r|U(t, 0)|r  )is the Green function describing how a localized wave 
 packet centered at r at time t = 0 propagates at a later time in the potential V (r). This equation represents the 
 wave function of a single particle (r, t) as a sum of partial waves propagating from r at time 0 to r at time t; it is 
thus the superposition of many dierent paths taken by the particle during its evolution. The probability of nding the particle at r results from a multiple-path interference process. 
This picture of the wavefunction propagation can be used to give a qualitative introduction of Feynmans path-integral approach to quantum physics. We do not aim here for a rigorous derivation of that theory, only the main concepts will be presented
13 . 
We start by expressing the probability amplitude that a particle, initially prepared at point xi, will pass a time 
t later at point xf as the matrix element between the initial and the nal state of the systems evolution opera
tor: xf |U(t, 0)|xi). We expand this expression by slicing the time interval t into innitesimal intervals t and by 
introducing at each of these times a closure relationship on the position eigenstates: 
xf |U(t, 0)|xi)= xf |U(t)n |xi)= 
1

Although angular momentum operators have some classical analogy, they are more general, as they describe for 
example physical properties that have no classical counterparts, such as the spin. In particular, the lowest dimension 
in which the commutation relationships above hold is 2. The angular momentum S for a TLS is represented by the 
operators:

Fig. 2: Bloch sphere representation of a qubit (TLS) [From wikipedia] 
Describing a TLS via the two angles  and  leads to a simple geometrical picture for the space occupied by this 
system. The angles dene a point on a sphere of radius 1, which is called Bloch sphere . The TLS can then assume 
any of the points on the surface of the sphere via a unitary transformation (in the following, we will also interested 
in the points inside the sphere, as well as means to reach them). The unitary evolution for this particular system 
can then be described as rotations of the state vector in the sphere. 
Using the example of a TLS we are thus going to introduce the concept of rotation and angular momentum, which can be generalized also to larger systems. 
4.2 Rotations and angular momentum 
4.2.1 Classical rotations 
Lets review rotation in classical mechanics (geometry). The rst property that we want to analyze is the fact that
 
successive rotations about dierent axes do not commute. Consider for example to start with a vector aligned along
 the z axis and then eectuate two rotations, one about the y axis and one about the z axis. Depending on the order,
 we obtain a rotation or no rotation at all.
 
Rotation are represented in 3D by orthogonal 3 3 matrices. (an orthogonal matrix is such that RR
T = RT R = 11.
 
In particular, rotations about the 3 axes are as f
ollow:
 

1 0 0 
R=  x()0 cos() sin() 
0 sin() cos() 


cos() 0 sin( ) 
R y() = 0 1 0 
sin() 0 cos() 

cos() 
z( ssin() 0 
R=   )in() cos() 0 
0 0 1 
It is easy then to show that R()R () = R (
)R() unless  =. W
hat about if the rotation angles are very 
small? We might expect then that the order matters less. We thus consider innitesimal rotations, where  =   0:

= After the measurement, the state is projected onto the upper arm, if we did detect a photon, or the 2
lower arm, otherwise. We assume that the neutron is free to continue on its path after the measurement and we perform a
 
second measurement after the second beamsplitter.
 
? Question: What is the probability of me asuring 1 neutron in the upper part in this case?
Now the state at 2 is |)2 = (|U)|L))/ 2, hence p(U) = (|U)= 1. 2
4.2.4 Spinor behavior 
 By calculating eiSSeiSwe see that the rotations of the operator give the following result: 
SSz
x  Sx cos()Sy sin(), 
SSz
y  Sy cos()+Sx sin(), 
SSz
z  Sz 
These are the same rotation rules we would have expected classically. In particular, taking the expectation values, we 
see that they correspond exactly to the rotations in 3D of a vector, with a periodicity of 2 . Things are a bit dierent 
(and more surprising) if we consider instead the state rotation. Consider the rotation of the state = 0 + 1
with respect to S| ) | ) | )
z: 
e iJz|)= ei/2|0)+ ei/2|1),
now the angle of rotation seems to be /2. This has an interesting consequence: if we rotate by  = 2 instead 
of returning to the initial state, as we would have expected, we obtain eiJz2 = . This is the so-called 
spinor behavior. Notice that from a simple measurement this minus sign (which |
is)
equiv
a|
le)
nt to a global phase) is 
irrelevant, hence we obtain the same expectation values for the angular momenta as before. We will see in P-Set on that experiments can be devised to show the spinor behavior (but they need to use more than one spin). 
4.2.5 The SU(2) and SO(3) groups 
A group G is a nite or innite set of elements together with a binary operation (called the group operation) 
that together satisfy the four fundamental properties of closure, associativity, the identity property, and the inverse 
property. A rotation group is a group in which the elements are orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. In the case of three-dimensional space, the rotation group is known as the special orthogonal group or SO(3)
9. The special 
unitary group SU(2) is the set of 2 by 2 unitary matrices with determinant +1 [it is a subgroup of the unitary group 
U(2)]. The two groups SO(3) and SU(2) both represent rotations, however there is a one-to-two correspondence for 
a given R  SO(3) there are 2 U  SU(2). This is because a 2  and 4 rotations are the same in SO(3) but they are 
11 and 11 in SU(2).

2. At the second order in  we can write the result as Rx()Ry()Ry()Rx() = R2z()11. This result stands 
also for cyclic permutations of the subscripts. These commutation relationships are a guide 
in nding commutation 
relationships that the equivalent QM rotation operators should obey. 
4.2.2 QM angular momentum as generator of rotations 
In QM we can as well dene rotations, as we already did for classical mechanics. Although we will rst study 
examples for TLS, rotations can be dened for any system (even higher dimensional systems). Generally, a rotation 
will be represented by an operator D(R()) associated to a classical rotation R(). We rst dene the action of an 
innitesimal rotation. To do so we dene the angular momentum operator J in terms of the innitesimal rotation : 
D(Rn()) =1J1iJ J n 
where J n is a unit vector. A nite rotation can be found by repeating many innitesimal rotations. For example, for 
a rotation about z:

Now we can revisit the TLS examples we have seen earlier. In particular we notice that the polarization rotator is 
represented by rotation operators, in particular rotations around the x-axis eiSx.
 
Consider another very simple system, a neutron interferometer, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

We send in a beam of neutrons. The rst beamsplitter divides the neutron ux into two parts, that will go into the upper arm or the lower arm. Thus the state of the system is at this point in time

1 =  |U)+  |L), + = 1 
We assume that the ux of neutrons is so low (neutrons can be very slow) so that only one neutron is present at 
any time inside the interferometer. The lower and upper beams are then reected at the mirrors and recombined at the second beam splitter, after which the neutron ux is measured at one arm. If we assume that both beamsplitter works in the same way, delivering  an equal ux to each arm (that is, the transmission and reection are the same),
then we have |)
1 = (|U)+ |L))/ 2 and |)2 = |U). 
? Question: What is the propagator describing the action of the Beamsplitter?

performs as we want. In particular, notice that UBSUBS = 11. 
Thus,ifour observable is the number ofneutronin the upper arm, the measurement always returns1 withcertainty(probability 
=1 ). 
Lets now consider the case in which we want to measure at point 1 how many neutrons are in the upper arm. The observable is just the projector onto the upper arm Ob = P
U = |U)(U|and we will detect one neutron (or zero neutrons) with probability 
1   . In fact p(U) = 1(|U)12= 1

4.1 Generalities 
We have already seen some examples of systems described by two possible states. A neutron in an interferometer, 
taking either the upper or lower path. A photon linearly polarized either horizontallyor vertically. A two level system (TLS) is the simplest system in quantum mechanics, but it already illustrates many characteristics of QM and it describes as well many physical systems. It is common to reduce or map quantum problems onto a TLS. We pick the 
most important states -the ones we care about and then discard the remaining degrees of freedom, or incorporate them as a collection or continuum of other degrees of freedom termed a bath. In a moreabstractway,we canthink of a TLS ascarrying a binaryinformation(the absence orpresenceof something, the information about a position, such as left or right, or up or down, etc.). Thus a TLS can be thought as containing 
a bit of information. By analogy with classical computers and information theory, TLS are thus called qubits. Their 
basis states are usually dened as |0)and |1)with a vector representation: 
|0)= [ 
1 ] 
, |1)= [ 
0 ]
0 1 
A general state is then |)= |0)+ |1). If it is normalized we have ||
2 + ||2 = 1. Then, this state can also be 
written quite generally in terms of the two angles  and : 
|)= cos(/2)|0)+ e i sin(/2)|1) 
For this state, the probability of nding the system in the 0[1] state is cos2 (/2) [sin2(/2)]. Notice that I could have 
written the state also as 
|)  |)= e i/2 cos(/2)|0)+ ei/2 sin(/2)|1) 
The two states are in fact equivalent up to a global phase factor. While relative phase factors (in a superposition) 
are very important, global phases are irrelevant, since they yield the same results in a measurement outcome. 
? Question: Show that a global phase factor does not change measurement outcomes and measurement statistics.
 
1.(Measurement outcome) As the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of the measurement operators, the rst
 
is trivially true.
 2.(Statistics) Lets consider an observable A with eigenvectors |a)= a
0|0)+ a1|1)corresponding to the eigenvalues a, then
 
the probability of obtaining a from the measurement is p(a) = 1(|a)12 = |a0 cos(/2) + a1e i sin(/2)|2 = 1(|a)12 =
 
i/2 i/2|a0e cos /2+a1esin /2|2 .

          <text>7.5.1 Classical Macro-states 
In classical statistical mechanics, equilibrium properties of macroscopic bodies are phenomenologically described 
by the laws of thermodynamics22 . The macro-state M depends on a relatively small number of thermodynamic 
coordinates. To provide a more fundamental derivation of these thermodynamic properties, we can examine the 
dynamics of the many degrees of freedom N, comprising a macroscopic body. Description of each micro-state , 
requires an enormous amount of information, and the corresponding time evolution is usually quite complicated. Rather than following the evolution of an individual (pure) micro-state, statistical mechanics examines an ensemble of micro-states corresponding to a given (mixed) macro-state. It aims at providing the probabilities p
M (), for the 
equilibrium ensemble. 
A. Microcanonical ensemble 
Our starting point in thermodynamics is a mechanically and adiabatically isolated system. In the absence of heat or 
workinput to the system, the internal energy E, and the generalized coordinates x, are xed, specifying a macro-state 
M = (E, x). The corresponding set of individual micro-states form the microcanonical ensemble. All micro-states 
are conned to the surface H() = E in phase space. The probability distribution function for a microstate  of 
Hamiltonian H is thus just given by the number of accessible states (E) at the xed energy E: 
1 pE () = (H()E)(E, x) 
B. Canonical ensemble 
Instead of xing the energy of the system, we can consider an ensemble in which the temperature of the system is 
specied and its internal energy is then deduced. This is achieved in the canonical ensemble where the macro-states, specied by M = (T,x), allow the input of heat into the system, but no external work. The system S is maintained 
at a constant temperature through contact with a reservoir R. The reservoir is another macroscopic system that 
is suciently large so that its temperature is not changed due to interactions with S. The probability distribution 
function (p.d.f.) for a microstate  of Hamiltonian H in the canonical ensemble is 
H()epT () = ,Z(T,x)
where the normalization Z(T,x) = {}eH() is the partition function and  = 1/kbT (with kb the Boltzmann 
factor). Unlike in a microcanonical ensemble, the energy of a system exchanging heat with a reservoir is a random variable, and it is e.g. possible to dene a probability distribution for the energy itself (by changing variables from 
 to H() in the p.d.f. above.) 
C. Gibbs and Grand-canonical ensemble 
A generalization of the canonical ensemble is to allow the energy to vary by both the addition of heat and work. The 
Gibbs canonical ensemble describes a system where (mechanical) work is done (which changes the internal variables x). In the Grand-canonicalensemble instead chemical work is performed (which varies the number of particles). Thus 
the chemical potential 
c is xed and N can vary. 
[The chemical potential of a thermodynamic system is the amount by which the energy of the system would change 
if an additional particle were introduced, with the entropy and volume held xed. The chemical potential is a 
fundamental parameter in thermodynamics and it is conjugate to the particle number.]

7.1 Mixed States 
Until now we have considered systems whose state was unequivocally described by a state vector. Although the 
result of an observable measurement on the state is probabilistic, until now the state of the system was well dened 
and evolved in a deterministic way. When we presented the fundamental concepts of QM we dened the state as a complete description of the set of probabilities for all observables. In particular, we put this into the context of the preparation step of an experiment. Since in order to obtain information about a system, the experiment has to be 
repeated many times, often we deal with an ensemble of systems (either an ensemble of copies of the same systems, 
or an ensemble in time of the same system). In many cases, when we repeat in experiment, it might be dicult to 
prepare the system in exactly the same state (or prepare perfectly identical copies), thus there is some uncertainty on the initial state. 
To describe this situation in more abstract terms, we are thus interested in the case where our information regarding the system is not complete. Thus we will associate the concept of state of a system with an ensemble of similarly prepared systems. By this, we mean an ensemble of systems that could have been prepared in principle, we do not 
need to refer to a a concrete set of systems that coexist in space. 
The rst postulate now reads:to eachstate correspondsa unique state operator . The dynamical variable X over the 
ensemble represented by the state operator  has expectation value given by: (X)= Tr{X}/Tr{}= (i|X |i)
i
(Notice that here the summation is done over some basis, but any basis is equivalent as it gives the same result). If we impose to  to have trace 1, the expectation value of X is just (X)= Tr{X}. We impose further constraints on 
: 
 Tr{}= 1 as said. 
  is self-adjoint 
 = , so that (X)is real. 
  is non-negative (u| |u) 0. 
These properties will allow us to associate a probability meaning to . The state operator  can be expressed as 
the sum of projectors:  = N n |un)(un|, where N is the dimension of the space (that is,  has a spectral n=1 
representation in terms of projectors). With the properties established above, we have: n = 1, n =  , that is, n n
the coecients are real: 0  n  1.
 
If the system can also be described by a state vector |), the state operator is given by:  = |)(|. A state that
 
can be written in this way is called pure state .

          <text>(OA)= Tr{OAA}and on the composite system: (OA)= Tr{(OA 11B )AB }. We can rewrite this last equation 
as (OA)== TrA {OATrB {AB }}where TrB denote the partial trace on the B system. Thus, to obtain information 
about observables of a subsystem we can rst take the partial trace of the state density operator and then use that 
to calculate the expectation value. We use also the partial trace to reduce the dimensionality of the system: 
A = TrB {AB }. 
To calculate the partial trace, write  as a sum of tensor products  = ijkh mijkh |ai)(aj ||bk)(bh|20 and for each 
term we have: Tr B {|ai)(aj ||bk)(bh|}= |ai)(aj |Tr{|bk)(bh|}. 
We are often interested in describing a particular system inside a larger space and we would like to just describe 
the state of this system S without having to describe or know the overall system. The larger system containing the 
subsystem which we are interested in, can be the environment, a cavity, a eld. By doing a partial trace over the 
environment degrees of freedom we discard the knowledge about them. In general we will obtain a state operator 
that describes a mixed state (that as we saw, describe some lack of knowledge onthe system). The state operator can 
thus be seen as resulting from the reduction of a larger system to a smaller one, via the partial trace. If the initial multipartite system was entangled, the reduced system is left in a mixed state, since some information was lost. The partial trace reveals the level of entanglement of a state. 
7.3.1 Examples 
1) Pure product state (separable): 
AB = A B . The reduced density matrix is therefore: A = TrB {AB }= A.r 
No information is lost about the A state.
 
2) Pure entangled state: Bell State.  = (|00)+|11))((00|+(11|)/2 = (|00)(00|+|00)(11|+|11)(00|+|11)(11|)/2.
 
The partial trace over B picks up only the diagonal terms and it gives the reduced matrix: A = TrB {}=
 r 
(|0)(0|+|1)(1|)/2. All the information about the system A is now lost, since it is now in the maximally mixed state 
(the identity). 
7.4 Entanglement measurement 
We have seen examples of entangled states, but we havent given a formal denition of entanglement yet. This is 
because it is not easy to give such a denition in the most general case. It is however possible to do so in the simplest case of bipartite pure systems. In that case we say that a state is entangled if it cannot be written as |)= |a)|b). 
If such a decomposition exists, the state is called a separable or product state. The Schmidt decomposition can be 
used to check if the state is separable. 
 Theorem: For any vector v on the tensor product H1 H2 of two Hilbert spaces, there exist orthonormal sets on 
m 1 2 1 2each space {ui },{ui }such that v can be written as v = i uwith ai non-negative.i=1 aiui 
The proof is obtained from the singular value decomposition21 . 
The number m of the vectors needed for the decomposition is called the Schmidt rank and the ai are the Schmidt 
2coecients. If the Schmidt rank of a vector is one, the associate state is separable. Note that aare the eigenvaluesi 
of the reduced density matrix obtained by taking the partial trace over the other system. As such, the rank is easily
 calculated by taking the partial trace.
 
The Schmidt rank is sometimes used to quantify entanglement for pure, bipartite systems. There exists many other
 
measure of entanglement, however they coincide at least for this simplest case. For more complex cases, multi-partite,
 mixed states, the measures are not equivalent and sometimes ill-dened.
 
A. Concurrence 
One of the most used metrics for pure bipartite states is the concurrence. It can be operatively dened as: C = 
2| |, where the 4 coecients are dened as: |)=  |00)+ |01)+ |10)+ |11). This metric has the following 
properties: 
20 Notice that by the Schmidt theorem (see later)we can always nd such decomposition.

          <text>Since the stateoperatorforapure state isa projector, it isan idempotent: 2 =  (Proof:(|)(|)(|)(|) = |)(|). 
Therefore, the eigenvalues of  and 2 are the same, or 2 
n = n and they must be either 0 or one. Since we know 
that the sum of the eigenvalues, which is equal to the trace, must be one, we can deduce that the state operator for 
a pure state has just one eigenvalue equal one and all the other are zero. This is the denition of a pure state, a state with only one non-zero eigenvalue (and equal to 1). An equivalent formulation is to say that Tr{

2} 
= 1. 
A more general state operator can be written as a convex sum of pure states. To dene a convex sum, lets consider 
a set of state operators {i}and the operator  = aii. If 0  ai 1i and ai = 1, the sum is said to be convex 
and  is a good state operator. 
? Question: Show that the representation as a convex sum of pure states is not unique.

There is actually an innite number of ways of representing . A state operator that is not pure, is called mixed
 
state. The properties of a mixed state are that Tr{
2} 
&lt; 1 and it cannot be expressed in terms of one pure state
 
only.
 
As said, the state operator for a pure state is the outer product of the pure state vector and its dual:  = |)(|.
 
The expectation value of an observable is therefore (X)= Tr{|)(|X}= Tr{(|X |)}since the trace is invariant
 
under permutation. We nd the known result: (X)= (|X |).
 
Imagine we have two state operators in the same Hilbert space. We have:
 
0  Tr{12} 1 
the equality Tr {12}= 1 is reached only if the two state operator are equal and pure. 
7.2 Dynamics of mixed states and operators 
For a pure state, the evolution is dictated by the Schr odinger equation: 
d |)i = H|)dt 
which has formal solution: |(t))= U(t, 0)|(0)). The unitary operator U (the propagator) that gives the evolution 
is the solution of the equation: 
dU i = HU(t, 0) dt 
If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the propagator has the form: U(t, 0) = eiHt. The dynamics of a pure state 
in state operator form ( = |)(|) is simply given by: 
(t) = |(t))((t)|= U(t, 0)|(0))((0)|U(0) = U(t, 0)(0)U(t, 0) 
The equivalent of the Schr odinger equation for the state operators is the Liouville equation: 
d = i [H,],dt 
which can be easily derived from the evolution of vector states described by Schr odinger equation.

          <text>D. Entropy 
Given a probability distribution, we can dene the entropy S as 
S = kb 
pa log(pa) 
a 
(with the convention that x log(x)  0 for x  0) where pa describe the probability distribution (0  pa  1, 
pa = 1). It is a measure of our knowledge about the state of the system. a 
For example, if pj = 1, pi = 0, i j, S =0 (minimum entropy, maximum knowledge). If instead we have a uniform = 
distribution pi = 1/N, i, S is maximum: 
1  1 )
S = kb  
log = kb log(N). N N i 
In the ensemble interpretationof the density matrix, the entropy S() = kbTr{ log }can be seen to have the same 
meaning as in classical statistics,sincewegiveaprobabilisticmeaning tothe density matrix.Given the decomposition 
into pure states:  = pi |i)(i|we obtain that S() = kbi pi log(pi). In particular the entropy is maximized 
for the identity state. 
The entropy S describesthe lackofknowledge in thesystemand itcanalsobeused toquantify subjectiveestimatesof 
probabilities. In the absence of any information, the best unbiased estimate is that all N outcomes are equally likely. 
This is the distribution of maximum entropy. If additional information is available, the unbiased estimate is obtained 
bymaximizing the entropy subject tothe constraints imposed bythis information.Theentropy maximizationmethod 
corresponds to nding the best unbiased estimate by minimizing the amount of information that we introduce in the 
estimate (given what we know about the distribution). 
Forexample, inthecanonicalensemble,wemaximizetheentropygivena xed averageenergy.Thecanonical ensemble can in fact exchange energy with a large heath bath, so that the system is thermalized and the energy kept xed. 
The microcanonical ensemble instead describes an isolated system, where the possible states of the system have the 
same energy and the probability for the system to be in any given state is the same. 
7.5.2 Quantum Macro-states 
We can as well formulate a statistical theory for QM. In QM we have seen already that micro-states are described 
by vectors in Hilbert spaces, evolving unitarily according to the Schr odinger equation. Unlike in classical mechanics, 
the value of an operator O is not uniquely determined for a particular micro-state. It is instead a random variable, 
whose average in a state |)is given by (O)= (|O|). 
As in the classical case, we can dene quantum macro-states describing ensembles of micro-states. Macro-states of 
the system depend on only a few thermodynamic functions. We can form an ensemble of a large number N of micro
states 
a corresponding to a given macrostate. The dierent micro-states occur with probabilities pa. (For example 
pa = 1/N in the absence of any other information.) When we no longer have exact knowledge of the microstate, it 
is said to be in a mixed state. 
A mixed quantum state is obtained from a set ofpossible states {|a)}, with probabilities {pa}. The ensemble average 
of the quantum mechanical expectation value of an observable O is thus 
(O)= 
pa (a|O |a)= 
pa(a|n)(n|O |m)(m|a)= 
(m|a)pa(a|n)(n|O |m)= Tr{O}
a m,n,a m,n,a
where we dened the density matrix: 
pa |a)(a|
a 
with the properties seen above (trace normalization to 1, hermiticity, positivity). We have also already seen that the density matrix obeys the Liouville equation: 
d in = [H,]dt

          <text>(where the last expression is calculated in the energy eigenbasis). 
We can calculate the average energy and the entropy: 
 (E)= Tr{
He H/Z} 
=  (lnZ) 
S = kB Tr{ log2 }= kB (E)+ kB ln Z 
In general, any macroscopic observable can be calculated from the partition function. 
C. Grand Canonical ensemble 
In the Grand Canonical ensemble the number of particles N, is no longer xed. Quantum micro-states with indenite 
particle number span a space called Fock space (we will come back to this concept when studying the e.m. eld). 
The density matrix can be obtained as before, where we maximize the entropy, subjected now to conditions on the 
energy and the particle number. It can be shown (although we only mention it here) that 
H+Ne(, ) = ,Q 
where the normalization is:  
H+ N ZN () Q(, ) = Tr{
e N }

We can go from one of the Bell State to another with simple local operations (e.g. 1 |+)= |+)), but local x 
operations (that is, operations on single qubit) cannot change the degree of entanglement.

7.5 Mixed States and interpretation of the density matrix 
We have seen how a mixed state emerged naturally from tracing over one part of a composite system, when the two parts were entangled. Now we can also introduce a density operator as a probabilistic description of a system, instead 
of the reduced system of a larger one. We consider an ensemble of systems: this ensemble can arise either because 
there are many copies of the same system (as for example in NMR, where there are 10
18 molecules in the sample) or 
because we are making many experiments on the same system (for example in a photon counting experiment from 
the same molecule). In this last case we have an ensemble over the time. The requirements on the ensemble are 
1. that the elements of the ensemble do not interact with each other (rst type of ensemble), and 
2. that the system does not have memory (ensemble over time). 
With these requirements, the physical ensembles we are considering are equivalent to a more abstract concept of 
ensemble, as seen at the beginning of the chapter.

iU I = H0U(t) and iUI = UI (t)H0 I 
We obtain therefore: 
H0U(t)U + U[H,(t)]U + U(t)UH0 
= [H0,I (t)]+[U(t)H(t)U(t),I (t)] 
= [HI ,I (t)] 
 where HI = U(t)VUI (t).I 
A. Example: rf Hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation 
The interaction picture is particularly useful when the Hamiltonian is composed by a large part time independent 
iH0 t(H0) and a small, time-dependent part H1(t). The interaction picture is dened by the operator U(t)I = e, 
which would give the evolution of the state operator if H1 were zero. The interaction picture allows to make more 
evident the eect of the perturbation on the system, by isolating it and often by simplifying the calculations. 
Let for example consider the following Hamiltonian acting on a two level system 19: 
i0tz xe i0tzH = 0z +1e , 0  1, (0) = (11+z )/2 
H
0    
H1 
Since [H 0,z] = 0, in the absence of the perturbation the system does not evolve, it is a constant of the motion. 
i0 tz Let us dene an unitary operator R = e that operates the transformation to the interaction picture. We can
 
rewrite the Hamiltonian as: H = 0z + R1xR .
 
The state operator in the interaction picture is given by: (t)I = R(t)(t)R(t). Its evolution is therefore:
 
dI dR d dR = R(t)+R(t) R + R(t) dt dt dt dt 
Notice that dR = i0z and dR = i0z. We obtain:dt dt 
dI d = i [0z ,]+R(t) R(t)dt dt 
and using Liouville equation we have: 
dI dI = i [0z ,]iR 
H,]R = iR[H1,]R = 1[R(RxR)R, RR 
 = i [1x I (t)]dt dt 
Notice that this is true in general: 
dI  
 
 = i H1,I , , H = U(t)H1(t)UI (t)Idt 
7.3 Partial Trace 
We dene the partial trace of a bipartite system on HAB = HA HB as a linear map Tr B {}from HAB  HA (or 
HB ) that is determined by the equation 
TrB {A B}= ATr{B} 
(whereA, B are operators on HA, HB respectively). This can be extended to more general composite (multipartite)
 
systems. As for the trace, the partial trace is independent of the basis.
 
Why do we dene the partial trace? Consider a composite system composed of two parts, A and B, and an ob
servable of the rst system only OA. The expectation value of the observable on the system A alone is given by:

density matrices can now be constructed in analogy to classical statistical mechanics. For example, it is possible to 
use this minimization of the entropy to calculate the density matrix describing a mixed state. 
A. Microcanonical ensemble: 
As the internal energy has a xed value E, a density matrix that includes this constraint is 
(HE)(E) = (E) 
In the matrix representation this can be written as 
1 n,m = (n| |m)= pa(m|a)(a|n)= (En E)n,m, a 
where H|n)= En |n). Thus, only eigenstates of the correct ener gy can a ppear in the quantum wave-function and 
(forpa = 1/N) such states on average have the same amplitude, |(n|a)|2 = 1/. This is equivalent to the classical 
postulate of equal a priori equilibrium probabilities. The  eigenstates of energy E are combined in a typical micro
state with independent random phases. Note that the normalization condition Tr {}= 1, implies that (E) = 
(E En) is the number of eigenstates of H with energy E. n 
Notice that we can also obtain the same resultbyusingthe maximization ofthe entropymethod. For a microcanonical 
ensemble, we have no other knowledge on the system than the normalization constraint (Tr {}= 1). We thus want 
to nd an unbiased estimate that reects this minimum knowledge by maximizing the entropy. We thus calculate 
the density matrix by posing: { 
max(S) 
Tr{}= 1 
We can use the Lagrangian multiplier method to solve this problem. Dene a function L = S  [Tr{}1], where 
 is a coecient that multiply the constraint condition. The constrained maximum is found at the maximum of the 
function L: 
dL{ = 0  kbTr{log2  +11}Tr{11}= 0d
 
dL
 = 0  Tr{}= 1d 
We therefore nd   11, since log( )  11 from the rst equation. From the normalization condition we obtain: 
ii = 1/N, where N is the dimension of the Hilbert space. This expresses the same condition as above (although for 
a discrete system). 
B. Canonical ensemble: 
A canonicalensemble describes a system with a xed temperature. A xed temperature T = 1/(kB ) can be achieved
 
by putting the system in contact with a reservoir. The canonical density matrix is then obtained by maximizing the
 
system entropy under the constrain of a given average energy.
 
If the average energy is xed we have another condition, (E)= Tr{H}in addition to normalization. Therefore:
 
L = kB Tr{ log2 }1 [Tr{H}(E)]2 [Tr{}1] 
We can now calculate the maximum of L: 
kbTr{log2  +1}1Tr{H}2Tr{11}= 0  log2  = 1H+ K11 
The density matrix is therefore an exponential:  = eH/Z, where  = 1/(kBT ) and Z is the partition function, 
determined by the normalization condition: 
EnZ = Tr{
e H} 
= e

          <text>? Question: Derive the Liouville equation.
 
Given the denition of density matrix as a convex sum of pure states:
 
 
 =p|)(|
 
where each vector state obeys Schr odinger equation: 
in|)= H|) 
we obtain, by taking the derivative of the rst equation and inserting the second one: 
in = in Lp(|)(|+ |)(|) L  
= p(H|)(|+ |)(|H) = [H,] 
The solution of the Liouville equation is: 
(t) = U(t)(0)U(t) 
7.2.1 Heisenberg picture 
As the Liouville equation is more general than the Schr odinger equation, we would like to reformulate the QM 
dynamics starting from it. We are thus interested in obtaining the evolution of the observables in the Heisenberg 
picture starting from the Liouville equation. The expectation value ofan observable O attime t isgivenbythetrace: (O(t))= Tr{(t)O}= Tr{
U(t, 0)(0)U
O} 
= 
Tr{
(0)UOU }
. Notice that using the invariance of the trace under cyclic permutation it is possible to assign the 
time dependence either to the state operator (Scrh odinger picture) or to the operator (Heisenber picture). In the rst 
one, the state evolves forward in time while the observable operator is time-independent. In the Heisenberg picture instead, the observable evolves backward (since as we saw U
 = U(t), at least for time-independent hamiltonian) 
and the state operator is xed. With this last picture we can follow the evolution of the observable without having to establish a state operator, that is, we can generalize this evolution to a class of state operators. 
The operator in the Heisenberg picture at time t is given by: O
H (t) = U(t, 0)OU(t, 0) and it evolves following the 
equation: 
dOH O )
= i [H(t),OH (t)]+ dt t H 
The observable expectation value must be the same in the two pictures: 
d(O(t)) { d O } {O }
= TrO +  = Tri(t)[H,O]+(t)dt dt t t 
and: 
d(O(t)) { dOH } { O ) } 
= Tr (0) = Tr i(0)[H,OH ]+(0) dt dt t H 
7.2.2 Interaction picture 
We revisit the interaction picture also in the context of the Liouville equation. Assume that the overall Hamiltonian 
of the system can be written as H = H0 + V (where we separate the known, trivial part H0 from the interesting 
one, V ). The transformation to the interaction picture is operated by the propagator UI (t) = eiH0t, such that 
 |)I = U|)and AI = U AUI .I I 
The evolution of the density matrix in the interaction picture I = U UI , is then: I 
  iI = iU (t)UI + iUI UI + iU UI (t)I I

that a particular experiment will eectively couple to the EM eld only over some nite bandwidth, thus we can set
cut-os on the number of modes considered.
Notice that we can as well calculate Bfor the magnetic eld, to nd the same expression.
10.4.2 Coherent states
A coherent state of the e.m. eld is obtained by specifying a coherent state for each of the mode oscillators of the
eld. Thus the coherent state vector will have the form
| /vectoran}backeti}ht=|12...an}backeti}ht=|1an}backeti}ht|2an}backeti}ht...
It is parameterized by a denumberably innite sequence of complex numbers. We now want to calculate the evolution
of the electric eld for a coherent state. In the Heisenberg picture it is:
E(x,t) =/summationdisplay/radicalbig

then, taking the expectation value we nd:
an}backetle{tE(x,t)an}backeti}ht=/summationdisplay/radicalbig
2/planckover2pi1m[meimt+meimt]um(x)
m
This is exactly the same form as a normal mode expansion of a classical solution of Maxwells equations, with the
parametermrepresenting the amplitude of a classical eld mode. In spite of this similarity, a coherent state of the
quantized EM eld is not equivalent to a classical eld, although it does give the closest possible quantum operator,
in terms of its expectation value. Even if the average eld is equivalent to the classical eld, there are still the
characteristic quantum uctuations. A coherent state provides a good description of the e.m. eld produced by a
laser. Most ordinary light sources emit states of the e.m. eld that are very close to a coherent state (lasers), or to a
statistical mixture of coherent states (classical sources).
A. Fluctuations

This is independent of m, and is equal to the mean square uctuation in the ground state. The Heisenberg inequality
is therefore saturated when the eld is in a coherent state,

zero, two of the components of u(x) will vanish, so there is only one mode in this exceptional case.

where we set the cuto wave-vector kc=c/c. The factor k4
cindicates that this energy density is dominated by
the high-frequency, short-wavelength modes. Taking a minimum wavelength of 6c= 2/k= 0.4 10m, so as to
include the visible light spectrum, yields a zero-point energy density of 23 J/m3. This may be com
pared with energy
density produced by a 100 W light bulb at a distance of 1 m, which is 2 .7 108J/m3. Of course it is impossible
to extract any of the zero-point energy, since it is the minimum possible e
nergy of the eld, and so our inability
to perceive that large energy density is not incompatible with its existence. Indeed, since most experiments detect
only energy dierences, and not absolute energies, it is often suggested that the troublesome zero-point energy of
the eld should simply be omitted. One might even think that this energy is only a constant background to every
experimental situation, and that, as such, it has no observable consequences. On the contrary, the vacuum energy
has direct measurable consequences, among which the Casimir eect is the most prominent one.
In 1948 H. B. G. Casimir showed that two electrically neutral, perfectly conducting plates, placed parallel in vacuum,
modify the vacuum energy density with respect to the unperturbed vacuum. The energy density varies with the
separation between the mirrors and thus constitutes a force between them, which scales with the inverse of the
forth power of the mirrors separation. The Casimir force is a small but well measurable quantity. It is a remarkable
macroscopic manifestation of a quantum eect and it gives the main contribution
bodies for distances beyond 100nm.
We consider a large cavity of dimensions V=L3bounded by conducting walls
(see gure). A conducting plate is inserted at a distance Rfrom one of the yz
faces (RL). The new boundary condition at x=Ralters the energy (or
frequency) of each eld mode. Following Casimir, we shall calculate the energy
shift as a function of R. LetWXdenote the electromagnetic energy within a
cavity whose length in the xdirection is X. The change in the energy due to the
insertion of the plate at x=Rwill be

We will now provide a quanto-mechanical description of the electro-magnetic eld. Our main interest will be in
analyzing phenomena linked to atomic physics and quantum optics, in which atoms interacts with radiation. Some
processes can be analyzed with a classical description: for example we studied the precessing and the manipulation
of a spin by classical static and rf magnetic elds. Absorption and emission of light by an atom can also be described
as the interaction with a classical eld. Some other phenomena, such as spontaneous emission, can only arise from a
QM description of both the atom and the eld. There are various examples in which the importance of a quantum
treatment of electromagnetism becomes evident:
Casimir force
Spontaneous emission, Lamb Shift
Laser linewidth, photon statistics
Squeezed photon states, states with subpoissonian distribution,
Quantum beats, two photon interference, etc.
10.1 Classical theory of the e.m. eld

elds.
Maxwell equations for the electric and magnetic elds, E and B, are:

Maxwell-Faraday equation (Faradays law of induction) E=1B

The photon number distribution for each mode in a coherent state is obtained as for the h.o. The probability of

The probability of nding nphotons in the mode misP(nm) =|an}backetle{tnm|an}backeti}ht|2. Using the expansion of the coherent

10.4.3 Measurement Statistics
We saw in the previous section the photon number distribution for a coherent state. This corresponds to the exper-
imental situation in which we want to measure the number of photons in a eld (such as laser light) which is well
approximated by a classical eld and thus can be represented by a coherent state.
This is not the only type of measurement ofthe e.m. eld that we might want to do. Two other common measurement
modalities are homodyne and heterodyne detection35.
Homodyne detection corresponds to the measurement of one quadrature amplitude. In practice, one mixes the e.m.
eld with a local oscillator at with a xed frequency (same as the eld frequency) before collecting the signal with

The strategy has been to use the known forms of the operators for a harmonic oscillator to deduce appropriate
dh(t)operators for the e.m. eld. Notice that we could have used the equationn=cfn(t) to eliminate fnand writedteverything in terms of hn. This would have corresponded to identifying h
nwith position and fnwith momentum.
Since the Hamiltonian is totally symmetric in terms of momentum and position, the results are unchanged and we
can choose either formulations. In the case we chose, comparing the way in which the raising and lowering operators
enter in the EandBexpressions with the way they enter the expressions for position and momentum, we may
say that, roughly speaking, the electric eld is analogous to the position and the magnetic eld is analogous to the
momentum of an oscillator.
10.2.1 Zero-Point Energy and the Casimir Force
The Hamiltonian operator for the e.m. eld has the form of a harmonic oscillator for each mode of the eld34. As
we saw in a previous lecture, the lowest energy of a h.o. is1/planckover2pi1. Since there are innitely many modes of arbitrarily2high frequency in any nite volume, it follows that there should be an innite zero-point energy in any volume of
space. Needless to say, this conclusion is unsatisfactory. In order to gain some appreciation for the magnitude of
the zero-point energy, we can calculate the zero-point energy in a rectangular cavity due to those eld modes whose
frequency is less than some cuto c. The mode functions un(x), solutions of the mode equation for a cavity of
dimensions LxLyLz, have the vector components
un,=Acos(kn,xrx)sin(kn,yry)sin(kn,zrz)
for{,,}={ /vector x,y,z}and permutations thereof. The mode un,(x) are labeled by the wave-vector knwith compo-
nents:nkn,=, nL N
and the frequency of the mode is n=k2 2n,x+k2n,y+kn,z. At least two of the integers must be nonzero, otherwise
the mode function would vanish identic/radicalig
ally.
The amplitudes of the three components Aare related by the divergence condition /vector un(x) = 0, which requires
/vector/vectorthatAk= 0, from which it is clear that there are two linearly independent polarizations (directions of A) for each

Thus, even in the absence of eld, it is possible to make the transition from the ground to the excited state! In the
semiclassical case (where the eld is treated as classical) we would have no transition at all. These are called Rabi

2The force per unit area (pressure) is then P=/planckover2pi1c
4. This is the so-called Casimir force. This force is very dicult240Rto measure. The surfaces must be at and cle
an, and free from any electrostatic charge. However, there has been
measurements of the Casimir eect, since the experiment by by Sparnaay (1958).
The availability of experimental set-ups that allow accurate measurements of surface forces between macroscopic
objects at submicron separations has recently stimulated a renewed interest in the Casimir eect and in its possible
applications to micro- and nanotechnology. The Casimir force is highly versatile and changing materials and shape
of the boundaries modies its strength and even its sign. Modifying strength and even sign of the Casimir force has
great potential in providing a means for indirect force transmission in nanoscale machines, which is at present not
achievable without damaging the components. A contactless method would represent a breakthrough in the future
development of nanomachines. More generally, a deeper knowledge of the Casimir force and Casimir torque could
providenew insights and design alternativesin the fabrications ofmicro- and nanoelectromechanical-systems(MEMS
and NEMS). Another strong motivation comes from the need to make advantage of the unique properties of Carbon
Nanotubes in nanotechnology.
Measuring the Casimir force is also important from a fundamental standpoint as it probes the most fundamental
physical system, that is, the quantum vacuum. Furthermore, it is a powerful experimental method for providing
constraints on the parameters of a Yukawa-type modication to the gravitational interaction or on forces predicted
by supergravity and string theory.

We have already treated a similar case in a semiclassical way, although we were interested in the interaction with
a magnetic eld. The semi-classical treatment of this interaction, is quite similar: we treat the atom quantum
/vector mechanically and therefore consider das an operator, but treat the electromagnetic eld classically and so consider
Eas a vector. We can write the dipole moment operator as

/vector /vector Lets rst considera single mode classical electromagneticeld, given by E=Eeit+Eeit. The full semi-classical

Notice the correspondence with the spin Hamiltonian Hspin=z+Bcos(t)xdescribing the interaction of a spin
with a time-varying, classical magnetic eld.
We can now go into the interaction frame dened by the Hamiltonian H0=10z. Then we have:2
H=(|0an}backeti}htan}backetle{t1|/vectord ei0t/vector+| (E/vector 1an}backeti}htan}backetle{t0|d ei0t)eit/vectorc 01 10 +Eei ts )
On resonance ( 0=) we retain only time-independent contributions to the Hamiltonian (RWA), then
Hsc (|1an}backeti}htan}backetle{t0|dE+|0an}backeti}htan}backetle{t1|dE)
Assuming for example that dEis real, we obtain an Hamiltonian dEx, in perfect analogy with the TLS already
studied. (A more general choice of dEjust gives an Hamiltonian at some angle in the xy plane).
Now let us consider a full quantum-mechanical treatment of this problem. The interaction between an atom and a
quantized eld appears much the same as the semiclassical interaction. Starting with the dipole Hamiltonian for a
two-level atom, we replace E by the corresponding operator, obtaining the interaction Hamiltonian

          <text>Combining Maxwell equation in vacuum, we nd the wave equations:
212EE = 0 Bc2t2212B
 = 0c2t2
?Question: Show how this equation is derived
We need to take the curl of Maxwell-Faraday equation and the time derivative of Amperes law and use the vector identity
(/vector v) =(/vector v)2/vector vand Gauss law.
/vector A general solution for these equations can be written simply as E=E(t k /vector x). By xing the boundary conditions,
we can nd a solution in terms of an expansion in normal modes, where th
e tim
e dependence and spatial dependence
are separated. The solution of the wave equation can thus be facilitated by representing the electric eld as a sum of
normal mode functions:
E(/vector x,t) =fm(t)/vector um(/vector x).
m
The normal modes uare the equivalent of eigenfunc/summationdisplay
m tions for the wave equation, so they do not evolve in time
(i.e. they are function of position only). The umare orthonormal functions, called normal modes. The boundary
conditions dene the normal modes umfor the eld, satisfying:
2um=k2
mum,um= 0, /vector num= 0
(wherenis a unit vector normal to a surface). This last condition is imposed because the tangential component of
the electric eld E must vanish on a conducting surface. We can also choose the modes to satisfy the orthonomality
condition (hence normalmodes):/integraldisplay
/vector um(x)/vector un(x)d3x=n,m
Substituting the expression for the electric eld in the wave equation, we nd an equation for the coecient fm(t):
/summationdisplayd2fm+c2k2
mfm(t) = 0.dt2
m
Since the mode functions are linearly independent, the coecients of each mode must separately add up to zero in
order to satisfy the wave equation, and we nd :
d2fm+c2k2
dt2mfm(t) = 0.
As it can be seen from this equation, the dynamics of the normal modes, as described by their time-dependent
coecients, is the same as that of the h.o. with frequency m=ckm. Hence the electric eld is equivalent to an
innite number of (independent) harmonic oscillators. In order to nd a quantum-mechanical description of the e.m.
eld we will need to turn this h.o. into quantum harmonic oscillators.
We want to express the magnetic eld in terms of the same normal modes /vector umwhich are our basis. We assume for B
the expansion:

          <text>10.3 Quantization of the e.m. eld in the Coulomb gauge
The quantization procedure and resulting interactions detailed above may appear quite general, but in fact we made
an important assumption at the very beginning which will limit their applicability: we considered only the situation
/vector with no sources, so we implicitly treated only transverse elds where E= 0. Longitudinal elds result from charge
distributions and they do not satisfy a wave equation. By considering only transverse elds, however, we have
further avoided the issue of gauge. Since a transverse electric eld ETsatises the wave equation, we were able to
directly quantize it without intermediate recourse to the vector potential Aand thus we never encountered a choice
/vector of gauge. In fact, the procedure can be viewed as corresponding to an implicit choice of gauge = 0,A= 0 that
corresponds to a Lorentz gauge.
A more general approach may use the canonical Hamiltonian for a particle of mass mand charge qin an electro-
magnetic eld. In this approach, the particle momentum pis replaced by the canonical momentum p qA/c , so the
Hamiltonian contains terms like H (p qA/c)2/2m. In this case, it is still possible to write a wave eq
uation for the
potentials. Then the potential are quant
ized and for an appropriate choice of gauge we nd again the same results.
Specically, for an appropriate choice of gauge, the pAterms imply the dipole interaction Edthat we will use in
the following.
Within the Coulomb gauge, the vector potential obeys the wave equation

t2c22A= 0

10.4 States of the e.m. eld
Because of the analogies of the e.m. with a set of harmonic oscillators, we can apply the knowledge of the h.o. states
to describe the states of the e.m. eld. Specically, we will investigate number states and coherent states.
10.4.1 Photon number eigenstates
We can dene number states for each mode of the e.m. eld. The Hamiltonian for a single mode is given by m=
/planckover2pi1m(a
mam+1) with eigenvectors |nman}backeti}ht. The state representing many modes is then given byH
2
|n1,n2,...an}backeti}ht=|n1an}backeti}ht|n2an}backeti}ht=|/vector nan}backeti}ht
Therefore the mthmode of this state is described as containing nmphotons. These elementary excitations of the e.m.
eld behave in many respects like particles, carrying energy and momentum. However, the analogy is incomplete,
and it is not possible to replace the e.m. eld by a gas of photons.

For photons near resonance with the atomic transition, the rst two processes conserve energy; the second two
processes do not conserve energy, and intuition suggests that they may be neglected. In fact, there is a direct
correspondence between the RWA and energy conservation: the second two processes are precisely those fast-rotating
terms we disregarded previously.

1.1 Why study Quantum Mechanics? 
1.2 Striking Characteristics of QM 
1.1 Why study Quantum Mechanics? 
Quantum mechanics (QM) is a fundamental and general theory that applies on a very wide range of scale, from 
subatomic systems to astrophysical objects. 
It is nowadays also a widely applied subject, with real-life applications (from transistors to lasers) and an active area 
of research. For example, it is at the basis of research in nanotechnology, in materials science, in spintronics (where 
the electron spin replaces the charge as the fundamental unit for storing information in a computer), etc. 
Also,there hasbeen aresurgent interest in the fundamental theory ofQM, due tothe interest in quantum information 
as well as the availability of control on single quantum systems1. Although you might not be directly interested in 
quantum information per se, this discipline has shaped a new view of QM that is having impact also on practical 
applications. On the pedagogical side, it has pushed for a new way of presenting QM in college courses, that I will try to partially follow here, with more emphasis on discrete systems and applications instead of an historical presentation 
of QM theory. (You probably already have had that kind of historical introduction, both in undergrad and in 22.101). 
1.2 Striking Characteristics of QM 
QM is known for being weird, counterintuitive and dicult to understand2. The vast majority of physicists do not 
worry about the puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics, but simply use it as a tool without asking questions of 
principle. Nevertheless, the theoretical and, especially, experimental progress made over the past twenty years have 
led to a better grasp of certain aspects of the behavior of quantum objects. 
In this class we will explore these counterintuitive phenomena, in particular we will emphasize three characteristics 
of QM: 
 Discreteness This is the characteristic that gave the discipline its name of quantum mechanics
3. While classical physics and the 
word around us seems to be continuous, in QM some quantities can only take a discrete set of values. Examples are the discrete energy levels of atoms or the amount of energy emitted in black body radiation (these are historical 
examples). In the rst part of the course we will focus on discrete systems, in particular on a system that can assume only two states. 
1 This is exemplied by the work of the two Physics Nobel laureates in 2012, Dave Wineland and Serge Haroche. 
2 For those who are not shocked when they rst come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it. Niels Bohr, 
quoted in Heisenberg, Werner (1971). Physics and Beyond. New York: Harper and Row. pp. 206. I think I can safely say that 
nobody understands quantum mechanics. Richard Feynman, in The Character of Physical Law (1965)

          <text>Interference 
Interference and diraction are characteristics of waves, in particular light. In QM it was found that interference
 
also applied to matter and it is actually a general phenomenon. E.g. diraction observed with large objects such
 
as fullurenes (C60). We will see how interference is linked to the possibility of nding a system in a superposition
 state and further explore even weirder phenomena such as entanglement.
 
 Phase coherence 
The ability to observe interferences is linked to ability for a system to maintain a phase coherence among the
 
dierent parts in a superposition state. Conversely, the loss of this phase coherence is linked to the disappearance
 of the QM properties of a system and the observation of classical physics behavior. This occurs e.g. when the
 
system interacts with an environment and a good part of this course will focus on the study of these so-called
 
open quantum systems.

6.1.1 Product Operator Basis 
We can generalize these considerations to more than two TLS (or qubits or spin-1). We thus dene a composite2Hilbert space of dimension N = 2n, where n is the number of qubits, as the tensor product of the Hilbert space for 
H n each qubit: = i=1 Hi. A basis for this operator space is the product operator basis (also called generalized Pauli
operators). Elements of this basis are dened as 
n
(j)Pl = n 
Pl ,
j=1 
 (j) where each Plis either a Pauli matrix x,y,z or the identity 11 in the space of the qubit j. Notice that Pl  
 = Pl
(hermitian) and Tr {PlPl }= Nl,l (tha{
t is, the ba}
sis is orthogonal, but nor normalized). 
6.2 Quantum Information Processing 
Quantum information processing is the study of information processing tasks that can be accomplished (only) using 
quantum mechanical systems. What do we mean by only? What we refers to are tasks that can be possible only 
if the law of quantum mechanics apply to the system used for processing the information or that are accomplished 
in a more ecient way if performed by a quantum system (in terms of time or material resources). For example, Peter Shor showed in 1994 that it is possible to nd the prime factors of a number using a quantum computer in an 
exponentially shorter time than in a classical computer. The scaling refers to the fact that if we want to factorize a 
number represented by n bits of information (e.g. in its binary representation the string is n-character long) it will 
take a time T
cl  2n for a classical computer to perform the computation, while only a time Tqu n to a quantum 
computer. Although factoring the number 15 is easy14, factoring large numbers is a very time-c 
onsuming task, so 
much that encryption is based on number factoring (as the reverse operation, nding the product of two numbers, is instead an easy task). 
14 Why do I mention here 15? Because that is the number that has been possible to factorize until now by a quantum 
computer:

departure, and these correlations reappear as a correlation between the results of Alice and Bob. 
However, the situation becomes weirder if Alice and Bob decide to use the x axis instead of the z axis for another 
series of measurements. In the classical case, this would correspond to the fact the ball hidden in the suitcases 
possess another property (for example they are shiny or matte). Again, one would obtain the same result of perfect anti-correlation of the results (try e.g. expressing the Bell state in the x basis). 
In the usual classical picture of the world, one would assume as stated by Einstein the hypothesis of Locality 
and Realism (both of these hypothesis should be true at the same time). What do these hypotheses entail? 
1. Realism: At preparation, particles a and b possess both the properties (color and gloss for the classical balls and 

x, z , with x,z = x(z) = 1 for the quantum particles). 
2. Locality: When I measure particle a I cannot modify instantaneously the result of measuring particle b, since b 
already had its own properties and there is no action at distance (faster than light). 
In the EPR paper, the authors argue that since QM does not give a description coherent with these hypotheses, there must be a more complete theory able to fully describe reality while respecting these hypotheses. The search for a theory of hidden variables is still open, but it has been shown already that local realism is in conict 
with experiment. 
The Bell inequalities want to show that these two hypotheses cannot be true together for quantum mechanics. They 
describe a more general experiment to what done until now. 
I -Assume that A measure her particles along the axis a a = a z while B along the axis ab such that ab  a z = cos. The 
results of the measurements are (

Then what we have done is a collective rotation of the coordinate frame, but we have seen already that the Bell state 
is unchanged by such a rotation. Thus by repeating the same analysis we will nd that a  b  )= ab)= cos. 
III -Consider then the following experiment: 
 A can measure either a a or a a
 
ab 
 B can measure either ab or 
and we want to look at the correlation of the outcomes ab), a  b), ab  )and a  b  ). The quantity we are interested 
in is actually S)= ab)+ a  b  )+ ab  )a  b). There are two possible strategies: 
a) One can measure each correlation in separate experiments (i.e. we measure separately ab)etc.). We then expect 
the results ab)= cosab, a  b)= cosa  b etc. and 
S)= (cosab + cosa  b + cosab cosa  b) 
b) Onecan lookattheoutcomeofthequantity Sk = (AB )k +(A 
 B )k +(AB )k(A 
 B )k at each kth experiment. ab a b ab a b 1Then the expectation value is S)= limN jSk. Notice that this denition of the quantity Sk implies that Nk 
 even in experiments were we measure e.g. along a a (i.e. we measure A and not a a , A still has a well-dened value  a z 
(realism). We can rewrite Sk as
 
Sk = aA(bB + bB 
 )k aA 
 (bB bB 
 )k
 
In each measurement, the possible results for B are 1 (and the same for B ) so that the possible outcomes for b b 
B +B are {0, +2, 2}and the same for the dierence. Whenever B +B = 2 we have however that B B = 0b b b b b b 
and vice-versa. Thus the possible outcomes for Sk are 2a or 2a  or nally Sk = 2 (since outcomes for a are 
1 and we assume that the act of measuring B does not change the outcome of A). Then, the expectation value for 
any possible choice of the axis direction is bounded by

          <text>6.5 Entanglement and EPR paradox
 
It is nearly 70 years ago that Schr odinger gave the name Verschraenkung to a correlation of quantum nature. This 
term was then rather loosely translated to entanglement . Over the decades the meaning of the word entanglement has 
changed its avor, going from a negative statement by Einstein and coworkers An entangled wavefunction does not 
describe the physical reality in a complete way , to more quantitative denitions (Bell, A correlation that is stronger 
than any classical correlation ) to more practical ones (C. Bennett: A resource that enables quantum teleportation , 
P. Shor: that allows for faster algorithms ).
 
A simple denition of entanglement is possible for pure, bipartite systems (i.e. composed of two subsystems).
 
D: Entanglement A pure state |)is called separable i it can be written as |)= |)1  |)2, otherwise it is
 
entangled. An example for a pure separable state is |00); examples for pure entangled states are the Bell states

   ) 
= (|01)|10))/ 2 
We will see some measure of entanglement and also some diculties arising for example in dening and measuring
 
entanglement for more complex systems.
 
Why is entanglement a dicult property to quantify and more importantly, to grasp its meaning?
 
We will review the so-called EPR paradox which makes it manifest some of the weirdness of QM as associated to
 
entanglement.
 
In 1935 Einstein published a paper with some coworkers that asked :
 
Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?17 
We will rephrase their result in a slightly dierent way (due to Bohm) and following the presentation in Ballentines 
book18 . 
6.5.1 Bell Inequalities 
 
Let us suppose that we are capable of making a state |)= (|01)  |10))/ 2 of two identical spin-1/2 particles, 
with the two particles traveling with equal momenta in opposite directions. For example, they could originate in the 
decay of an unstable particle of zero spin and zero momentum, in which case momentum conservation implies that the particles move in opposite directions and have spin with zero sum. 
Two experimentalists, conventionally named Alice and Bob (A,B), measure the spin component of each particle along 
a certain axis when the particles are very far apart compared with the range of any force of mutual interaction and when they have not interacted with each other for a long time. 
Alice measures the spin component on the  a axis for the particle traveling to the left, particle a, while Bob measures 
the component along the b axis of the particle traveling to the right, particle b. Let us rst study the case where 
 Alice and Bob both use the z-axis, a = b = z. For the moment we can just think of the spins as a property of the 
particles, as it could be e.g. the color of a ball. 
Alice measures the z component of the spin of particle a, S
a
z, with the result 1 
2, and Bob measures Sb
z. They 
obtain a series of random results, when they repeat the experiment. After the series of measurements has been 
completed, Alice and Bob meet and compare their results. They conclude that the results for each pair exhibit a perfect (anti-)correlation. When Alice has measured +1 /2 for particle a, Bob has measured 1/2 for particle b and 
vice versa. 
Upon reection, this result is not very surprising. It can occur also for classical particles (or travelers!). Two travelers 
a and b, each carrying a suitcase, depart in opposite directions from the origin and eventually are checked by two 
customs inspectorsAlice and Bob. One of the suitcasescontainsa red ball and the other agreen ball, but the travelers have picked up their closed suitcases at random and do not know what color the ball inside is. If Alice checks the suitcase of traveler A, she has a 50% chance of nding a green ball. But if in fact she nds a green ball, clearly Bob

          <text>The last equation is veried iif  |)= 1 or  |)= 0. In the rst case, the two states are in eect the same state 
(up to a normalization factor or a global phase, which are not important). In the second case the two states are 
orthogonal, in contradiction with the hypothesis. 
A unitary operator cannot copy an arbitrary state. If we nd an operator that can clone one state, it can only copy that state and states which are orthogonal to it, but it cannot clone all the other states. In a Hilbert space it is therefore possible to dene an operator that clones the basis states, but not an arbitrary superposition of them. 
Example of Cloning 
Consider the action of the CNOT gate on the state |)|0), where |)is the state we would like to clone and |0)is 
the blank bit we want to copy on. If |)= |0), the CNOT gives us the state |00), if it is |1)we obtain the state: |11). 
So it seems that it is possible to copy the state of the rst qubit on the second qubit. But notice that for the moment 
we have only veried that we can copy two orthogonal state. If we have a more general state: |)= a |0)+b |1), the 
action of the CNOT will give us: 
CNOT |, 0)= CNOT (a |00)+ b |10)) = a |00)+ b |11)
 |, )(a |0)+ b |1))(a |0)+ b |1)). = = 
Notice that approximate cloning is possible
16 (that is, it is possible to obtain an approximate copy of an arbitrary 
state up to an error . The error is usually measured as the deviation from unity of the inner product of the original 
and cloned state:  = 1| |)|).

Abstract - The impossibility of perfectly copying (or cloning) an unknown quantum state is one of the basic rules governing 
the physics of quantum systems. The processes that perform the optimal approximate cloning have been found in many 
cases. These quantum cloning machines are important tools for studying a wide variety of tasks, e.g., state estimation 
and eavesdropping on quantum cryptography. This paper provides a comprehensive review of quantum cloning machines 
both for discrete-dimensional and for continuous-variable quantum systems. In addition, it presents the role of cloning in quantum cryptography, the link between optimal cloning and light amplication via stimulated emission, and the experimental demonstrations of optimal quantum cloning.

          <text>A. Measurement in the x basis 
At the end of a circuit, the qubits are measured. While usually it is implicit that the qubits are measured in their 
computational basis ( |0), |1)), which corresponds to the eigenvalues of the operator z, this does not always has to 
been the case. The eigenvectors of x form an equivalently good basis. We could have expressed a state vector as: 
|)= a |0)+b |1)  |)= c |0)+d |1)= c |+)+d |)(the last expression is a notation encountered often). The z x x x 
coecients c and d can be calculated with a change of basis. First, notice that the eigenvectors of x in the z-basis 
are given by the eigenvectors of the matrix 
0 1 x = ,1 0 
that is:   
|+)= (|0)+ |1))/ 2 |)= (|0)|1))/ 2 
The operator that perform the change of frame is therefore the Hadamard matrix: |)= H |). This is also the x z 
reason why, instead of measuring in the x-basis, we can perform an Hadamard operation to bring back the qubit to
 the z-basis, and measure in this more usual basis.
 
The representations of gates, qubits and wires is usually done via diagrams like the following:
 
|0)A H  U 
|0)B H

6.4 No cloning Theorem 
We are going to study some properties of quantum states that distinguish them from classical states. One property 
that has been known for a long time, without stirring much interest before it was considered again in the optics of quantum computation is the impossibility of copying a quantum state. This impossibilities seemed to doom quantum 
computation, because it seemed to forbid correction codes, but quantum resources oer other ways to perform error 
correction. 
The so-called No-cloning theorem, states that: 
 Theorem: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown, pure state by an unitary operation. 
Proof: I want to copy an arbitrary state |)=  |0)+  |1)on the blank initial state |i)using a unitary operator U. 
The nal state is therefore: 
?U |)|i)= |)|) 
for any state |)in the domain of the rst system. If I assume to be able to copy any arbitrary state, I can assume 
that I can copy at least another state |), which is not the state |)and not orthogonal to it. For this second state 
we have: 
U |)|i)= |)|) 
Equating the inner products of the RHS and LHS of the two equations above, we obtain: 
, i|UU |, i) = , |, )=
 
 |)i |i) =  |) |)

          <text>While it is still a debate of where the power of quantum computation comes from, two main ingredients seems to 
have a preeminent role. Quantum superposition (in the form of parallelism that allows to compute all the possible 
solutions of a problem at once) and interference (that leads to algorithms that select a constructive interference for 
the correct solution, so that we obtain the right answer with high probability once we measure the quantum system and collapse the superposition state). As it is implied in this last statement, not all the tasks can be made more ecient on a quantum computer and in fact it has proven quite hard to nd quantum algorithms (although the 
known ones are quite powerful). 
Quantum information processing has ramications well beyond quantum computation. Very active areas of research 
- and of practical results - are quantum communications, simulations, sensors, and of course on the theory side, 
quantum control, quantum complexity, entanglement theory, decoherence, etc. 
Here we will adopt some of the language and tools of quantum information to explore ideas that connect to the very 
foundation of quantum theory. We will start by describing operations that can be performed on a quantum computer. 
As at its heart a quantum computer is just a QM physical system, these operations simply describe the evolution of the system itself. 
In the same way as classical computer are physical systems, circuits made of wires and gates, a quantum computer 
is also composed of wires and quantum gates. The wires are used to carry the information around, while the gates 
perform operations, manipulate the information. Quantum gates however have the properties of being linear and 
invertible , as they represent the unitary evolution of a quantum system (a collection of TLS or qubits). This is 
dierent than usual classical gates, although invertible classical gates were already known.

If somebody has taken some computer science classes, you can realize that the truth table of the cnot gate is quite 
similar to that of a XOR gate. We can also just have general single qubit gates, U, that describe any general rotation

on a single qubit. If we combine this single qubit rotations with the CNOT gates on any pair of qubit, we are able to build any possible algorithm (or computation) on the system. That also means that we are able to enforce any 
possible evolution of the system, by letting it evolve under these two types of gates. We says that they are universal 
gates.

- 486 (2007) Abstract  Quantum entanglement is the main resource to endow the eld of quantum information processing with 
powers that exceed those of classical communication and computation. In view of applications such as quantum 
cryptography or quantum teleportation, extension of quantum-entanglement-based protocols to global distances is of considerable practical interest. Here we experimentally demonstrate entanglement-based quantum key distribution 
over 144 km. One photon is measured locally at the Canary Island of La Palma, whereas the other is sent over an 
optical free-space link to Tenerife, where the Optical Ground Station of the European Space Agency acts as the receiver. This exceeds previous free-space experiments by more than an order of magnitude in distance, and is an 
essential step towards future satellite-based quantum communication and experimental tests on quantum physics in 
space.

6.7 Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm 
To illustrate the power of quantum computation, we present one of the simplest quantum algorithm, the Deutsch-
Josza algorithm. The algorithms goal is to decide whether a given function f(x) is constant for all values of x or 
balanced, that is, equal to 1 for half of the values of x and to 0 for the other half. The goal is to make this decision 
with the minimum possible number of evaluations of the function value on trial x and with a given probability of 
arriving at the correct answer. 
If the function f is dened on a space of dimension 2n (i.e.x can be stored in a n-bit string), the classical algorithm 
can decide the function with at least 2n +1 queries, while the quantum one only needs one query. The steps of the 2 algorithm are illustrated in the following picture, where H is the Hadamard gate and Uf is a unitary gate which 
transform the state |x, y)to Uf |x, y)= |x, y f(x))( indicates the addition modulo 2). 
In the case where f is a function from 1 bit to 1 bit, there are only 4 possible f, two constant and two balanced

(f1(x) = 1, f2(x) = 0, f3(x) = x, f4(x) = x = NOT x). SinceUf gives the sum y x, these functions correspond to 
the following Ui: 
f1  U1 = 1x UNot,y 
f2  U2 = 1x 1y (2) f3  U3 = UCNot 
f4  U4 = UCNotUNot,y 
Deutschs algorithm is a perfect illustration of all that is miraculous, subtle, and disappointing about quantum 
computers. It calculates a solution to a problem faster than any classical computer ever can. It illustrates the subtle 
interaction of superposition, phase-kick back, and interference. Finally, unfortunately, is solves a completely pointless problem. 
We begin by illustrating how superposition of quantum state creates quantum parallelism or the ability to compute 
on many states simultaneously.

Complete? Phys. Rev. 47, 777 - 780 (1935) 
Abstract  In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sucient condition 
for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function 
in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration 
of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.

Our results, in excellent agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions, strongly violate the generalized Bells 
inequalities, and rule out the whole class of realistic local theories. No signicant change in results was observed with source-polarizer separations of up to 6.5 m.

Abstract  The linear-polarization correlation of pairs of photons emitted in a radiative cascade of calcium has been

is a straightforward transposition of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm gedankenexperiment. The present results, in excellent agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions, lead to the greatest violation of generalized Bells inequalities ever achieved.

6.1 Tensor product of Hilbert spaces 
Until now we have been concerned with the description and evolution of a single TLS. Although we have seen some 
examples of how it describes some real physical systems, of course many systems are more complicated and cannot 
be described by that formalism. We could of course start studying higher dimensional systems, such as more general 
angular momentum with dimension N. Here we focus instead on systems with dimension N = 2n (with n integer) 
because we are interested in studying composite (or multipartite) systems, where two or more TLS systems interact. 
Lets consider 2 two-level Hilbert spaces HA and HB , each spanned by the vectors: |0)A, |1)A and |0)B , |1)B . For each 
space we can dene the Pauli Matrices and the identity on the space. They are two distinguishable Hilbert space 
(we will deal with indistinguishable particles later on). The action of a Pauli matrix on the vector of its own Hilbert 
space is as usual (e.g. A |0)= |1)). But operators of the A Hilbert space do not act on the vectors of the other xA A
Hilbert space, they leave them unchanged: A |0)= |0)B .xB 
We candenethejointspace HAB byatensorproduct HAB = HAHB , whichhasdimensions N = 2222 = 24 = 16. 
When we consider a matrix representation ofthe Hilbert space, this correspondsto a kroneckerproduct. For example, 
the kronecker product of two matrices (operators) A and B is given by: 
 A11B11 A11B12 A12B11 A22B11 
 
A11B A12B  
A11B21 A11B22 A12B21 ... A B = = 	 
A21B A22B	 A21B11 A21B12 ... ...  
A21B12 
that is, a 4  4 matrix. In the same way, the vector states of the joint Hilbert space are dened by the kronecker 
products of the basis states of the two spaces. For example: 
 0 
 
0   
1  
0|1)B =  = |0)A 1 0  1  
0 
A basis set for a two-qubit system (two TLS) is given by the four states: |00), |01), |10), |11). 
Notation-wise, we normally do not write the identity: A 1B = A .x x

Two parties -Alice and Bob- want to transfer an unknow quantum state. They share a resource prior to the transfer, 
a pair of qubit in one of the Bell States, let say |+)= (|00)+ |11))/2. Alice possesses also another qubit in an 
unknow pure state |)= a |0)+ b |1), that she wishes to send to Bob. The circuit below shows the steps in the 
teleportation algorithm, starting with the gates that create the Bell State on the ancilla qubits.

Fig. 10: Circuit for teleportation: the qubit |C (initially in Alices hands) is teleported to Bob ( |B) by using two qubits in 
a | Bell pair +
AB. 
Alice then transforms her unknown qubit and her part of the shared pair to the Bell State basis by a cnot and a 
hadamard gate. She then measures them in this new basis and via a classical communication channel, tells the result of the measurement to Bob. Bob performs then an operation on his qubit (the second half of the entangled pair) 
based on whatever the measurement result was: 
if |00)  do nothing 
if |01)  
x 
if |10)  z 
if |11)  xz 
This operation leaves Bobs qubit in the same state of the one initially owned by Alice. Notice that no superluminal speed of information transmission is proven by quantum teleportation, since classical communication is needed. Also, 
no cloning of an unknown, arbitrary state is happening (which is forbidden by quantum mechanics), since the original state is destroyed in the process. The state of the 3 qubits at each step is as follows:

Abstract  Quantum entanglement enables tasks not possible in classical physics. Many quantum communication 
protocols1 require the distribution of entangled states between distant parties. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the successful transmission of an entangled photon pair over a 144 km free-space link. The received entangled states have excellent, noise-limited delity, even though they are exposed to extreme attenuation dominated by turbulent 
atmospheric eects. The total channel loss of 64 dB corresponds to the estimated attenuation regime for a two-
photon satellite communication scenario. We conrm that the received two-photon states are still highly entangled

2.2.1 Hermitian operators 
2.2.2 Operators and their properties 
2.2.3 Functions of operators 
Quantum mechanics is a linear theory, and so it is natural that vector spaces play an important role in it. A physical 
state is represented mathematically by a vector in a Hilbert space (that is, vector spaces on which a positive-denite scalar product is dened); this is called the space of states. Physical properties like momentum, position, energy, 
and so on will be represented by operators acting in the space of states. We will introduce the essential properties 
of Hilbert spaces, mainly in the case of nite dimension, as the mathematical theory of Hilbert spaces of innite dimension is much more complicated than that of spaces of nite dimension 
2.1 Linear vectors and Hilbert space 
D: Linear vector space A linear vector space is a set of elements, called vectors, which is closed under addition and
 
multiplication by scalars.
 
Using Dirac notation, the vectors are denoted by kets: |k). We can associate to each ket a vector in the dual space
 
called bra: (|.
 
If two vectors |)and |)are part of a vector space, then + also belongs to the space. If a vector is in
 
the space, then  |)is also in the space (where  is a comp|
le)
x sc|
ala)
r).
 | )
A set of linearly independent vectors iis suchthat k ck k= 0if and only if ck = 0k (no trivialcombination
 
of them sums to zero).
 {|)} | ) 
The dimension of the space N is the maximum numbeL
r of linearly independent vectors (which is also the smallest
 
number of vectors that span the space).
 
D: Basis A maximal set of linearly independent vectors in the space is called a basis. (e.g. k, k = 1,..., N).
 
Any vector in the space can be written as a linear superposition of the basis vectors:
 {| )}
|) = 
ak 
k |k) (1) 
To any vector we can thus associate a column vector of N complex numbers ( a1,a2...an)T . Here we are going to 
restrict ourselves to bounded, nite dimension spaces (even if many physical spaces are not: for example energy 
spaces can be unbounded and position has innite dimension). 
D: Hilbert space The Hilbert space is a linear vector space over complex numbers with an inner product . 
D: Inner product An inner product is an ordered mapping from two vectors to a complex number (for a Hilbert 
space a mapping from a ket and a bra to a complex number c = (|)) with the following properties: 
 positivity: (|) 0. The equality holds only for the zero vector |)= 0. 
 linearity in the second function: (|(c11)+ c2|2)) = c1(|1)+ c2(|2).

 |=  |BA . 
A self-adjoint operator is also Hermitian in bounded, nite space, therefore we will use either term. Hermitian 
operators have some properties: 
1. if A, B are both Hermitian, then A +B is Hermitian (but notice that AB is a priori not, unless the two operators 
commute, too.). 
2. if A, B are both Hermitian but do not commute, then at least AB + BA is Hermitian. 
? Question: Prove property # 2. 
(AB + BA) = BA +AB = BA + AB. 
Before describing other properties we need the following denition.

D: Norm The norm of a vector is 11= (|). 
Since the Hilbert space is characterized by its inner product, vectors are dened up to a global phase, that is, 
|)= ei|). Relative phase is instead ver
y important: |)+ ei|)= |)+ |).

The equality holds only if the two vectors are in the same direction: |)= c|). 
There is also an antilinear correspondence between the dual vectors ket and bra: 
c1|1)+ c2|2) c
1(1|+ c2 (2| 
D: Orthonormal set A set of vectors {|k)}is orthonormal if for each pair the inner product (k|j )= k,j . 
2.2 Operators 
We can dene a set of operators that acting on the vectors return vectors: 
D: Operator An operator A on a vector space is a mapping between two vectors in that space: A|)= |). 
A linear operator satises: 
A(c1|1)+ c2|2)) = c1A|1)+ c2A|2) 
To characterize and parametrize A we look at its action on each vector in the space. Because of linearity, it is 
however enough to characterize A with its action on the N basis vectors k. In this way we can associate a 
matrix representation to any operator, in the same way we associated array{
s |
of )
c}
omplex numbers with the vectors. 
In particular, given an orthonormal basis {|v)k}, the matrix representation of the operator A is an N  N square 
matrix A whose elements are given by Ak,j = (vk|A |vj ). 
NLet us consider an orthonormal basis {vi}, then as seen any vector can be written as: |)= L
i=1 ai|vi). The action 
of an operator A becomes: 
N N 
A|)= |)   
Aai|vi)=  
bi|vi
i=1 i=1 )
To extract one of the coecients, say bk we multiply by the bra (vk |, obtaining: 
 N 
vkAaivi= bk Akiai = bk 
i=1 ( | | )   
i 
The action of an operator can be thus seen as a matrix multiplication (again, here we are restricting to bounded, 
nite dimension spaces that support nite operators, hence this simple matrix representation).

The domain of an operator is the subspace on which it acts non-trivially (spanned by k  N vectors).

          <text>2.2.3 Functions of operators 
Functions of operators are dened by the corresponding Taylor expansion of the function (if that exists). If f(x) = 
f(0) + f  (0)x +  + 1 f(n)(0)xn + ... , then f(A) = f(0)11+f  (0)A +  + 1f(n)(0)An + ... , where the matrix n! n!
power is dened recursively in terms of products An = A(An1). 
? Question: Show that given the spectral decomposition of the operator A = a a |a  a|we have f(A) = a f(a)
 |a  a|. 
We can rst prove that A2= ( |a  a|)( a |a  a|) = a2
a b a a a,b (|a  a| 
)(|b  b|) = aa |a  a|. Then  
show that if the 
theorem is valid for n 1 it is 
also valid for n 
. Finally, use th

its true.

(AB)|)= A(B|)) 
The operators are associative: 
A(BC)|)= (AB)C|) 
But they are not in general commutative: 
AB|)= BA|) 
D: Commutator . The commutator of two operators is [A, B] = AB BA. Two operators commute/are commutable 
if [A, B] = 0. 
2.2.1 Hermitian operators 
An important class of operators are self adjoint operators, as observables are described by them. 
D: Adjoint The adjoint of an operator A is an operator acting on the dual space with the property: (
(A)  )= 
(|(A)), {|), |)}. We can also have other notations. From (|)= (|) (where  indicates the complex 
conjugate) we have (
(A) 
)= (|(A))= (|A). Also, we can write the inner product as (|(A))= (|A|)  
and ((A)|)= (|A|). In matrix representation, this means that the adjoint of an operator is the conjugate 
transpose of that operator: A= (k|A |j)= (j|A |k)  = A 
k,j j,k. 
D: Self-adjoint . A self adjoint operator is an operator such that A and A operate on the same domain and with 
the property 
(|A|)= (|A|) 
or shortly, A = A. In matrix representation we have then: Aki = A 
ik . 
? Question: Prove that ( cA) = c  A 
 AWe want to prove that ( cA) = c . We can take two strategies: 
1) From the adjoint operator denition in the form:
 B| = |B , 
with B = cA we obtain:
    (cA)| = |cA = c |A = c A | = c A | 
2) Alternatively, we can use the adjoint denition in Diracs notation:
 |B| = |B|  , 
to get:
        |(cA)| = |cA| = c  |A| = c  |A| = |c A| 
Note that we can write 
(B|)= (|B)= (|B|)= (|B|) . 
The second notation (based on Diracs notation) could be seen as implying ( |)) = (|(and thus ( A|)) = (
A  . 
However, this applies the adjoint operation to a vector, while the adjoint is only properly dened for operators. For 
discrete dimensional spaces, which allow a matrix representation, there is no ambiguity since we have the equivalence 
of the adjoint with the complex-transpose of an operator (which can be dened also for vectors)4 .

any basis set we have:i|vian}backeti}htan}backetle{tvi|=11 (closure relation). The product of two projectors is PjPk=ikPj. Projectors

          <text>4 value of n but dierent values of l). Thus, according to non-degenerate perturbation theory, the polarizability of the 
ground-state (i.e., n = 1) of a hydrogen atom is given by 
2 L |(1, 0, 0|z|n, 1, 0)|2 
 = 2e . En E1 n&gt;1 
Here, we have made use of the fact that En10 = En00 = En.
 
The sum in the above expression can be evaluated approximately by noting that
 
2eEn =  ,80 a0 n2
40 2 where a0 = is the Bohr radius. Hence, we can write me e2 
23 eEn E1  E2 E1 = ,80 a0 
which implies that the polarizability is 
16 &lt; 40 a0 L 
|(1, 0, 0|z|n, 1, 0)|2 . 3 n&gt;1
1However, thanks to the selection rules we have, L|(1, 0, 0|z|n, 1, 0)|2 = (1, 0, 0|z2|1, 0, 0)= (1, 0, 0|r2|1, 0, 0),n&gt;1 3 where we have made use of the fact the the ground-state of hydrogen is spherically symmetric. Finally, from 
2(1, 0, 0|r2|1, 0, 0)= 3a0 we conclude that 
16 3 3&lt; 40 a0 5.3 40 a .03 
The exact result (which can be obtained by solving Schrdingers equation in parabolic coordinates) is 
9 3 3 = 40 a0 = 4.5 40 a .02 
B. The linear Stark eect 
We now examine the eect of an electric eld on the excited energy levels n  1 of a hydrogen atom. For instance, 
consider the n = 2 states. There is a single l = 0 state, usually referred to as 2s, and three l = 1 states (with 
m = 1, 0, 1 ), usually referred to as 2p. All of these states possess the same energy, E2 = e2/(320a0). Because 
of the degeneracy, the treatment above is no longer valid and in order to apply perturbation theory, we have to recur 
to degenerate perturbation theory. 
We rst need to Ud = QdVQd, where Qd is the projector obtained from the degenerate 2s and 2p states (that is, the 
operator that project into the degenerate subspace). This operator is, 
 0 (2, 0, 0|z|2, 1, 0) 0 0  
Ud = e |E|(2, 1, 0|z|2, 0, 0) 0 0 0  ( 
0 (2, 0, 0|z|2, 1, 0)) 
,  0 0 0 0  (2, 1, 0|z|2, 0, 0) 0 
0 0 0 0 
where the rows and columns correspond to the |2, 0, 0), |2, 1, 0), |2, 1, 1)and |2, 1, 1)states, respectively and in the 
second step we reduce the operator to the degenerate subspace only. To simplify the matrix we used the selection 
rules, which tell us that the matrix element of between two hydrogen atom states is zero unless the states possess the same n quantum number, and l quantum numbers which dier by unity. It is easily demonstrated, from the exact 
forms of the 2s and 2p wave-functions, that 
(2, 0, 0|z|2, 1, 0)= (2, 1, 0|z|2, 0, 0)= 3a

          <text>11.2 Time-dependent perturbation theory 
11.2.1 Review of interaction picture 
When rst studying the time evolution of QM systems, one approach was to separate the Hamiltonian much in the 
same way we did above for TIPT. We wrote (see Section 5.2): 
H = H0 + V (t) 
where H0 is a solvable Hamiltonian of which we already know the eigen-decomposition, 
H0|k)= Ek 0|k), 
iH0t) (so that it is easy to calculate e.g. U0 = eand V (t) is a perturbation that drives an interesting (although 
unknown) dynamics. Here we even allowfor the possibility that V is time-dependent. For any state |)= L
k ck(0)|k)
iE0 the evolution can be written as |)= L
k ck(t)ekt|k). This correspondto explicitly writing down the evolution due 
to the known Hamiltonian (if H = H0 then we would have ck(t) = ck(0) and the evolution would be given by only the 
phase factors). In other words, if we want to compare the state evolution with the initial eigenstates, by calculating 
the overlap |(k|(t))|2, we would be really interested only in the dynamics driven by V since |(k|(t))|2 = |ck(t)|2 
(whileE0 do not play a role).k 
We dene states in the interaction picture by 
|)I = U0(t)|)= e iH0 t|) 
Similarly we dene the corresponding interaction picture operators as: 
AI (t) = U 
0AU0  VI (t)= U 
0VU0 
We can now derive the dierential equation governing the evolution of the state in the interaction picture, starting from Schr odinger equation.

Inserting the identity 11 = U0U 
0, we obtain = U

0|)= VI |)I : 
|)Ii = VI (t)|)It 
This is a Schr odinger -like equation for the vector in the interaction picture, evolving under the action of the operator V
I (t) only. 
11.2.2 Dyson series 
Besides expressing the Schr odinger equation in the interaction picture, we can also write the equation for the propagator that describes the evolution of the state: 
dU
I = iVI UI , |(t))= UI (t)|I (0))Idt

          <text>Similarly, we can calculate the transition rate to a continuum of states. From the expression for a single state, 
2Wik = |Vki|2(Ek Ei), we integrate over all nal energies, Wif = J 
Wik (Ek )dEk, where f is the continuum 
of states k such that Ek Ei. Then we obtain the transition rate: 
2 W = |Vki|2(Ek)|EkEil 
This is Fermis Golden Rule. 
Virtual Transitions 
If the matrix element of the interaction connecting two given state is zero, we have seen from the expression above 
that no transition is possible, to rst order . 
(2) However, consider c(t). This is given by k

ikht ihit VkhVhi 1 
ikit ikht c(t) = VkhVhi dt  e e = dt  (e e )k 
h h same as before 00 0 ki 0     
If Eh = Ek,Ei, the second term oscillates rapidly and goes to zero. Finally we have: 
2 
2 VkhVhi Wik = Vki + L 
(Ek Ei)l ki h 
or for a continuum 2 
2 VkhVhi Wif = L 
(Ek)|EkEi Vki + l ki h 
Notice that even if Vik = 0, we can still have a transition to k, via virtual transitions to intermediate states, which 
are connected to the two relevant levels.

This is the Dyson series. 
11.2.3 Fermis Golden Rule 
The problem that we try to solve via TDPT is to calculate the transition probability from an initial state to a nal 
state. Consider an initial state |i)which is an eigenstate of H0 (H0 |i)= Ei |i)). Then in the interaction picture we 
have the evolution 
|i(t))= UI (t)|i)= L 
ck(t)|k), with ck(t) = (k|UI (t)|i)I
 
k
 
We can insert the perturbation expansion for UI (t) to obtain an expansion for ck(t): 
 t  
t t t  
 )+ ck(t) = (k|11i 1 
VI (t  )UI (t  )dt  |i)= (k|11i 1 
dt  VI (t  )+(i)2 1 
dt  1 
dt  VI (t  )VI (t ...|i)
0 0 0 0 
In the expansion we will obtain terms such as (k|VI (t)|i)that we can simplify since: 
(k|VI (t)|i)= (k|(U0V (t)U0)|i)= (U0k|V (t)|U0i)= (k|e iktV (t)e iit |i)= (k|V |i)e ikit = Vki(t)e ikit 
where we dened j = Ej /l and ki = k i. Using these relationships and the series expansion we obtain: 
(0)c(t) = (k|11|i)= ki k 
 (1) ikitc(t) = i Jt(k|VI (t  )|i)dt  = i Jt Vki(t  )e dt  
k 0 0    (2)c(t) = Jt dt  Jt dt  Vkh(t  )Vhi(t  )eikht eihit 
k 0 0 
From this expansion we can calculate the transition probability as P (i  k) = |ck(t)|2 . 
We rst consider the case where the perturbation V is time-independent and it is turned on at the time t = 0. Then 
we have t 
ikit ikit)(1) 1 Vki Vki ( kit )
ck (t) = iVki e  dt  = (1 e = 2i e ikit/2 sin
0 ki ki 2 
Then to rst order perturbation, the transition probability is 
4|Vki|2 ( kit )
P (i  k) = sin2 
2 2ki 
We can plot this transition probability as a function of the energy separation ki between the two states. We would 
expect that if the separation in energy is smaller, it will be easier to make the transition. This is indeed the case, 
since P has the shape of a sinc function square. 
Notice that the peak height is proportional to t2, while the zeros appear at 2 k/t, that is, the peak width is 
proportional to 1 /t (the other peaks are quite small). This means that the probability is signicantly dierent than

zero only for kit  2. In terms of energy, we have that tE  l (where we dened t as the duration of the 
interaction), or in other words, we can have a change of energy in the system only at short times, while at long times 
we require quasi-conservation of energy. Consider the limit of the sinc function: 
sin(t/2) lim = () 
t  
Then, from f(x)(x) = f(0) and sinc(0) = 1, we obtain 
( sin(t/2) )2 sin(t/2) sin( t/2) sin(t/2) ( sin(t/2) ) t t lim = lim = () = () = () 
t  t   t/2 2 2 
We have then found the transition probability at long time: 
tt P (i  k) ()4|Vki|2 ,2 
which conrms the fact that in the long-time limit we need to enforce energy conservation. A better dened quantity is the rate of transition: 
W (i  k) = 2 |V
ki|2(). 
(1) J t ikit (1) Notice that for ki = 0, from c(t) = e dt  we obtain c(t) = iVkit and thus the probability k iVki 0 k 
|ck(t)|2 = |Vki|2t2. There is a quadratic dependence on time for a single nal state. 
Now we consider a continuum of nal states, all with energy Ekf  Ei. Then the probability of a transition to this 
continuum is given by the sum of the probability for each individual state: Pf = L|ck|2  J 
dEk (Ek)|ck|2, where k 
we dened the density of states (Ek ), such that (Ek )dEk is the number of states with energy between Ek and 
Ek + dEk. We can then rewrite the probability as 
1 ( (E Ei)t ) |Vki|2 
Pif = 4 dE(E)sin2 
2 (E Ei)2 
Using the limit of the sinc function, we nd 
1 t |Vki|2 
Pif = 4 dE(E)(E Ei)2 (E Ei)2 
Since all the states are in a neighborhood of the energy, we expect |Vki|2  |Vki|2 over the range of energy of interest. 
Thus by evaluating the integral (with the delta function) we obtain the transition probability: 
Pif = 2|Vki|2t(Ek)|EkEi

          <text>C. Anti-crossing 
Consider two levels, h and k with energies E0 and E0 and assume that we apply a perturbation V which connectsk h 
only these two states (that is, V is such that (l|V |j)= 0 and it is dierent than zero only for the transition from h
 
to k: (h|V |k)= 0.)
 
If the perturbation is small, we can ask what are the perturbed state energies.
 
The rst order is zero by the choice of V , then we can calculate the second order:
 
(2) L |Vkj |2 |Vkh|2 
E= = k E0 E0 E0 E0 
j=k kj k h 
and similarly 
(2) L |Vhj |2 |Vkh|2 (2)E= = = E .h E0 E0 E0 E0 k 
j=h hj h k 
This opposite energy shift will be more important (more noticeable) when the energies of the two levels E0 andk 
E0 are close to each other. Indeed, in the absence of the perturbation, the two energy levels would cross whenh 
E0 = E0 . If we add the perturbation, however, the two levels are repelled with opposite energy shifts. We describek h
what is happening as an anti-crossingof the levels: even as the levels become connected by an interaction, the levels never meet (never have the same energy) since each level gets shifted by the same amount in opposite directions. 
D. Example: TLS energy splitting from perturbation 
Consider the Hamiltonian H = 
z + x. For  = 0 the eigenstates are |k)= {|0), |1)}and eigenvalues E0 = .k 
We also know how to solve exactly this simple problem by diagonalizing the entire matrix: 
E1,2 = v
2 + 22 , 
|1)= cos(/2)|0)+ sin(/2)|1), |2)= cos(/2)|1)sin(/2)|0) with  = arctan(/) 
For   1 we can expand in series these results to nd: 
22 
E1,2  ( + + ... )2 
    |1)  |0)+ |1)= |0)+ |1) | 2)  |1) |0)= |1) |0 )2 2 2 2 
As an exercise, we can nd as well the results of TIPT. First we nd that the rst order energy shift is zero, since 
E1 = (k|V |k)= (0|(x)|0)= 0 (and same for (1|(x)|1)). Then we can calculate the rst order eigenstate:k 
1  1 = |0)+(E10 H0)1P1V |0)= |0)+[(11z )]1|1)(1|x|0)= |0)+ |1)(1|x|0)= |0)+  |1)1 2 2 
1 |V12 |2 ()2 similarly, we nd = |1)   |0). Finally, the second order energy shift is E12 = = in agreement2 2 E0E0 21 2 with the result from the series expansion.
 We can also look at the level anti-crossing: If we vary the energy  around zero, the two energy levels cross each
 
other.

11.1.3 The Stark eect 
We analyze the interaction of a hydrogen atom with a (classical) electric eld, treated as a perturbation38. Depending 
on the hydrogens state, we will need to use TIPT or degenerate TIPT, to nd either a quadratic or linear (in the 
eld) shift of the energy. The shift in energy is usually called Stark shift or Stark eect and it is the electric analogue of the Zeeman eect, where the energy level is split into several components due to the presence of a magnetic eld. Measurements of the Stark eect under high eld strengths conrmed the correctness of the quantum theory over 
the Bohr model. 
Suppose that a hydrogen atom is subject to a uniform external electric eld, of magnitude |E|, directed along the 
z-axis. The Hamiltonian of the system can be split into two parts. Namely, the unperturbed Hamiltonian,

          <text>which gives a set of coupled equations in |k)and |k): 
1. PdV |k)= (Ek H0 PdVPd)|k) 
2. QdV |k)= (Ek H0 QdVQd)|k) 
Now (Ek H0 PdVPd)1 is nally well dened in the Pd subspace, so that we can solve for |k)from (1.): 
|k)= Pd(Ek H0 PdVPd)1PdV |k) 
and by inserting this in (2.) we nd 
(Ek H0 QdVQd)|k)= 2QdVPd(Ek H0 PdVPd)1PdV |k). 
If we keep only the rst order in  in this equation we have: 
[(Ek Ed)QdVQd]|k)= 0 
which is an equation dened on the subspace Hd only. 
We now call Ud = QdVQd the perturbation Hamiltonian in the Hd space and k = (Ek Ed)11d, to get: 
(k Ud)|k)= 0 
Often it is possible to just diagonalize Ud (if the degenerate subspace is small enough, for example for a simple double 
degeneracy) and notice that of course k is already diagonal. Otherwise one can apply perturbation theory to this 
(0) (0) (0)) ) )
subspace. Then we will have found some (exact or approximate) eigenstates of Ud, k, s.t. Ud k= ui ki i i 
(0)) 
(0))
and H0 k= Ed k, i. Thus, this step sets what unperturbed eigenstates we should choose in the degeneratei i 
subspace, hence solving the rst issue of degenerate perturbation theory. 
We now want to look at terms  2 in 
(Ek H0 Ud)|k)= PdVPd)1PdV |k) 2QdVPd(Ek H0 
where we neglected terms higher than second order. Rearranging the terms, we have: 
Ek |k)= [H0 + Ud + 2QdVPd(Ek H0)1PdV ]|k)  (H0 + V)|k)= Ek |k) 
with 
H0 = H0 + Ud V= QdVPd(Ek H0)1PdVQd 
)
If there are no degeneracies left in H0, we can solve this problem by TIPT and nd (n) .k

11.1 Time-independent perturbation theory 
Because of the complexity of many physical problems, very few can be solved exactly (unless they involve only 
small Hilbert spaces). In particular, to analyze the interaction of radiation with matter we will need to develop approximation methods
36 . 
11.1.1 Non-degenerate case 
We have an Hamiltonian 
H = H0 + V 
where we know the eigenvalue of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 and we want to solve for the perturbed case
 
H = H0 + V , in terms of an expansion in  (with varying between 0 and 1). The solution for   1 is the desired
 
solution.
 
We assume that we know exactly the energy eigenkets and eigenvalues of H0:
 
(0)H0 |k) = E|k)k 
As H0 is hermitian, its eigenkets form a complete basis L|k)(k|= 11. We assume at rst that the energy spectrumk 
(0)is not degenerate (that is, all the Eare dierent, in the next section we will study the degenerate case). Thek 
eigensystem for the total hamiltonian is then 
(H0 + V )|k) = Ek()|k ) 
where  = 1 is the case we are interested in, but we will solve for a general  as a perturbation in this parameter: 
(0)) 
(1)) 
(2)) 
(0) (1) (2)|k)=   
k +    
k + 2   
k + ..., Ek = Ek + Ek + 2E+ ...k 
36 A very good treatment of perturbation theory is in Sakurais book J.J. Sakurai Modern Quantum Mechanics, Addison
Wesley (1994), which we follow here.

Possible eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are |+1), |0), |1):

and |1)is a valid eigenstate, for example

 with energies + , 0, + respectively. However, any combination of |+1)
we could have chosen:   11 1   |+1) 0 |1) 0 = =, 
2 2 1 1 
This is the case because the two eigenstates are degenerate. So how do we choose which are the correct eigenstates
 
to zeroth order37? We need to rst consider the total Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace.
 
The degenerate subspace is the subspace of the total Hilbert space H spanned by the basis |+1), |1); we can call
 
this subspace HQ. We can obtain the Hamiltonian in this subspace by using the projector operator Q: HQ = QHQ,
 
with Q = |+1)(+1|+ |1)(1|= S2 . Then:
z 
HQ = Q(S2 + (Sz + Sx))Q = S2 + Sz z z 
(Notice this can be obtained by direct matrix multiplication or multiplying the operators). In matrix form: 
HQ = 
 H
Q = ( 
 +  
0 0 
 )  +  0 0 
0 0 0 
0 0   
where in the last line I represented the matrix in the 2-dimensional subpsace HQ. We can now easily see that the 
correct eigenvectorsfor the unperturbed Hamiltonian were the original |+1)and |1)after all. From the Hamiltonian 
in the HQ subspace we can also calculate the rst order correction to the energy for the states in the degenerate 
(1) (0) (1) (0)subspace. These are just EE+ and EE.+1 +1 = 1 1 = 
(1)Now we want to calculate the rst order correction to the eigenstates |1). This will have two contributions: |)= 1 
(1) (1)Q|)1 + P |)where P =11Q = |0)(0|is the complementary projector to Q. We rst calculate the rst term1 
in the following way. We redene an unperturbed Hamiltonian in the subspace HQ: 
H0 = HQ = QHQ = S2 + Szz 
and the perturbation in the same subspace is (following Sakurai): 
V = VQ = Q(VP ( H0)1PV )Q = Q 
(Sz + Sx)|0)(0|( |0)(0|)1 |0)(0|(Sz + Sx) 
Q = QSxPSxQ 
In matrix form: 
   ( 
1 1)1 0 1 
0 0 0  V
Q = VQ = = (11+x)1 1 2 2 21 0 1 
Now the perturbed eigenstates can be calculated as: 
L(h|VQ |k)
(1) (1)Q|)= |k)+ k |h)(1)EEhHQ=kk h 
37 Here by correct eigenstates I means the eigenstates to which the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian will tend to when

          <text>It can be seen, by inspection, that the eigenvalues of Ud are u1 = 3ea0 |E|, u2 = 3ea0 |E|, with corresponding 
eigenvectors

k2 =  =  1 2 2 
In the absence of an electric eld, all of these states possess the same energy, E2. The rst-order energy shifts induced 
by an electric eld are given by 
E1 = +3ea0 |E|, 
E2 = 3ea0 |E|, 
Thus, the energies of states 1 and 2 are shifted upwards and downwards, respectively, by an amount 3 ea0 |E|in the 
presence of an electric eld. States 1 and 2 are orthogonal linear combinations of the original 2s and 2p(m=0) states. 
Note that the energy shifts are linear in the electric eld-strength, so this is a much larger eect that the quadratic 
eect described in the previous section. The energies of states 2p(m=1) and 2p(m=-1) (which are outside the degenerate subspace) are not aected to rstorder(as we already saw abovefor the non-degenerate case).Of course, to second-orderthe energies ofthese states are 
shifted by an amount which depends on the square of the electric eld-strength, the quadratic shift found previously. Note that the linear Stark eect depends crucially on the degeneracy of the 2s and 2p states. This degeneracy is a special property of a pure Coulomb potential, and, therefore, only applies to a hydrogen atom. Thus, alkali metal 
atoms do not exhibit the linear Stark eect.

          <text>This equation is now ready to be solved by using the perturbation expansion. To simplify the expression, we dene 
the operator Rk 
(0) |h)(h|Rk = (EH0)1Pk = L 
k E0 E0 
h=k k h 
Now using the expansion 
(1) (1)|k)+ |)+  = |k)+ Rk(V Ek 1 Ek 2 ... )(|k)+ |)+ ... )k k 
we can solve term by term to obtain: 
1st (1)order: |)= Rk(V Ek 1)|k)= Rk(V (k|V |k))|k)= RkV |k)k 
(where we used the expression for the rst order energy and the fact that Rk |k)= 0 by denition). 
We can now calculate the second order energy, since we know the rst order eigenstate: 
  
(1) |h)(h|E2 
k = (k|V |k )= (k|VRkV |k)= (k|V L  V |k)E0 E0 
k hh=k 
or explicitly 
E2 L |Vkh|2 
= k E0 E0 
h=k k h 
Then the second order eigenstate is 
2nd order: 2 
= RkVRkV |k)k
A. Formal Solution 
We can also nd a more formal expression that can yield the solution to all orders. We rewrite Eq. (**) using Rk 
and obtain 
|k)= |k)+ Rk(V k)|k)= RkH1 |k) 
where we dened H1 = (V k). Then by iteration we can write: 
|k)= |k)+ RkH1 (|k)+ RkH1 |k)) = |k)+ RkH1 |k)+ RkH1RkH1 |k) 
and in general: 
|k)= |k)+ RkH1 |k)+ RkH1RkH1 |k)+  +(RkH1)n |k)+ ... 
This is just a geometric series, with formal solution: 
|k)= (11RkH1)1 |k) 
B. Normalization 
In deriving the TIPT we introduced a non-canonical normalization (k|k)= 1, which implies that the perturbed 
state |k )is not normalized. We can then dene a properly normalized state as 
|k)|k)= v
(k|k ) 
so that (k|k)= 1/v
(k|k ). We can calculate perturbatively the normalization factor (k |k): 
 |Vkh|2 
(k|k)= (k + 1 ...|k + 1 + ...)= 1+(k|1 
k |1 .. = 1+2 L
k + k)+ .. + 2(1 
k)+ (E0 E0)2 
h kh=k 
Notice that the state is correctly normalized up to the second order in .

11.1.2 Degenerate case 
If there are degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0, the expansion used 
above is no longer valid. There are two problems: 
1. If |k  ), |k  ), ... have the same eigenvalue, we can choose any combination of them as the unperturbed eigenket. 
But then, if we were to nd the perturbed eigenket |k), to which state would this go to when   0? 
2. The term Rk = (0) Pk can be singular for the degenerate eigenvalues. Ek H0 
Assume there is a d-fold degeneracy of the eigenvalue Ed, with the unperturbed eigenkets {|ki)}forming a subspace 
Hd. We can then dene the projectors Qd = L|ki)(ki|and Pd =11Qd. These projectors also dene subspaceskiHd 
of the total Hilbert space H that we will call Hd (spanned by Qd) and Hd(spanned by Pd). 
Notice that because of their nature of projectors, we have the following identities: 
P 2 = Pd, Q2 = Qd, PdQd = QdPd = 0 and Pd + Qd =11.d d 
We then rewrite the eigenvalue equation as: 
(H0 + V )|k)= Ek |k )  H 0(Qd + Pd)|k)+ V (Qd + Pd)|k)= Ek(Qd + Pd)|k) 
 (Qd + Pd)H0 |k )+ V (Qd + Pd)|k)= Ek (Qd + Pd)|k) 
where we used the fact that [H 0,Qd] = [H 0,Pd] = 0 since the projectors are diagonal in the Hamiltonian basis. We 
then multiply from the left by Qd and Pd, obtaining 2 equations: 
1.Pd [(Qd + Pd)H0 |k )+ V (Qd + Pd)|k)] = Pd (Ek(Qd + Pd)|k)) 
H0Pd |k )+ PdV (Qd + Pd)|k)= Ek Pd |k ) 
2.Qd [(Qd + Pd)H0 |k )+ V (Qd + Pd)|k)] = Qd (Ek (Qd + Pd)|k)) 
H0Qd |k)+ QdV (Qd + Pd)|k )= EkQd |k) 
and we simplify the notation by setting |k)= Pd |k)and |k)= Qd |k) 
H0 |k)+ PdV (|k)+ |k)) = Ek |k)
 
H0 |k)+ QdV (|k)+ |k)) = Ek |k)

(0)where of course = |k). When  is small, we can in fact approximate the total energy Ek by E. The energyk k 
(0)shift due to the perturbation is then only k = Ek Eand we can write:k 
(0) (0)(H0 + V )|k)= (E+ k)|k)  (EH0)|k )= (V k)|k)k  k 
Then, we project onto (k|: 
(0)(k|(EH0)|k)= (k|(V k)|k)k 
(0)The LHS is zero since (k|H0 |k)= (k|E|k), and from the RHS (k|(V k)|k)= 0 we obtain:k 
(k|V |k)k =   k = (k|V |k)(k|k) 
where we set (k|k)= 1 (a non-canonical normalization, although, as we will see, it is approximately valid). 
Using the expansion above, we can replace k by E1 + 2E2 + ... and |k )by its expansion:k k 
(1) (2)Ek 1 + 2Ek 2 +  =  (k|V (|k)+  )

and equating terms of the same order in  we obtain:

En = (k|V k k 
This is a recipe to nd the energy at all orders based only on the knowledge of the eigenstates of lower orders. 
(n1))
? However, the question still remains: how do we nd k 
We could think of solving the equation: 
(0)(EH0)|k)= (V k)|k) ()k 
(0)for |k), by inverting the operator (E H0) and again doing an expansion of |k)to equate terms of the samek 
order: 
|k)+  (1)) 
+  = (E(0) H0)1(V k)(|k)+  (1)) 
+ ... )k k k 
Unfortunately this promising approach is not correct, since the operator ( E(0) H0)1 is not always well dened.k 
(0) (0)Specically, there is a singularity for ( EH0)1 |k). What we need is to make sure that ( EH0)1 is neverk k 
applied to eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, that is, we need |k)= (V k )|k)  |k)for any |k). = 
We thus dene the projector Pk =11 |k)(k|= L|h)(h|. Then we can ensure that  |)the projected stateh =k 
|) = Pk |)is such that (k|  )= 0 since this is equal to 
(k|Pk|)= (k|)(k|k)(k|)= 0 
(0)Now, using the projector, (E H0)1Pk|)is well dened. We then take the equation ()and multiply it by Pk k 
from the left: 
(0)Pk(EH0)|k)= Pk(V k)|k).k 
(0) (0)Since Pk commutes with H0 (as|k)is an eigenstate of H0) we have Pk(EH0)|k)= (EH0)Pk |k)and wek k 
can rewrite the equation as 
(0)Pk |k)= (EH0)1Pk(V k)|k)k 
We can further simplify this expression, noting that Pk |k)= |k) |k)(k|k )= |k) |k)(since we adopted the 
normalization (k|k)= 1). Finally we obtain: 
(0)|k)= |k)+(EH0)1Pk (V k)|k) ()k

          <text>and the perturbing Hamiltonian 
H1 = e |E|z. 
Note that the electron spin is irrelevant to this problem (since the spin operators all commute with H1), so we can 
ignore the spin degrees of freedom of the system. Hence, the energy eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are 
characterized by three quantum numbersthe radial quantum number n, and the two angular quantum numbers l 
and m. Let us denote these states as the |nlm), and let their corresponding energy eigenvalues be the Enlm. We use 
TIPT to calculate the energy shift to rst and second order. 
A. The quadratic Stark eect 
We rst want to study the problem using non-degenerate perturbation theory, thus assuming that the unperturbed 
states are non-degenerate. According to TIPT, the change in energy of the eigenstate characterized by the quantum 
numbers n, l, m in the presence of a small electric eld is given by 
|(n, l, m|z|n  ,l  ,m  )|2 
Enlm = e |E|(n, l, m|z|n, l, m)+ e 2 |E|2 L 
. Enlm En  l m  
n  ,l ,m  =n,l,m 
This energy-shift is known as the Stark eect. The sum on the right-hand side of the above equation seems very 
complicated. However, it turns out that most of the terms in this sum are zero. This follows because the matrix 
 elements (n, l, m|z|n  ,l  ,m  )are zero for virtually all choices of the two sets of quantum number n, l, m and n  ,l  ,m .
 
Let us try to nd a set of rules which determine when these matrix elements are non-zero. These rules are usually
 referred to as the selection rules for the problem in hand.
 
Now, since [L
z,z] = 0, it follows that
 
(n, l, m|[Lz,z]|n  ,l  ,m  )= (n, l, m|Lz z zLz|n  ,l  ,m  )= l (m m  )(n, l, m|z|n  ,l  ,m  )= 0. 
Hence, one of the selection rules is that the matrix element (n, l, m|z|n  ,l  ,m  )is zero unless 
 m = m. 
The selection rule for l can be similarly calculated from properties of the total angular momentum L2 and its 
commutator with z. We obtain that the matrix element is zero unless 
l  = l 1. 
Application of these selection rules to the perturbation equation shows that the linear (rst order) term is zero, while 
the second order term yields 
L |(n, l, m|z|n  ,l  ,m)|2 
Enlm = e 2 |E|2 . Enlm En  l m n  ,l =l1 
Only those terms which vary quadratically with the eld-strength have survived. Hence, this type of energy-shift of
 an atomic state in the presence of a small electric eld is known as the quadratic Stark eect .
 
Now, the electric polarizability of an atom is dened in terms of the energy-shift of the atomic state as follows:
 
1 E =  
 |E|2 . 2 
Hence, we can write 
L |(n, l, m|z|n  ,l  ,m)|2 
nlm = 2e 2 . En  l m Enlm n  ,l =l1 
Although written for a general state, the equations above assume there is no degeneracy of the unperturbed eigenvalues. However, the unperturbed eigenstates of a hydrogen atom have energies which only depend on the radial 
quantum number n, thus they have high (and increasing with n) order of degeneracy. We can then only apply the 
above results to the n = 1 eigenstate (since for n  1 there will be coupling to degenerate eigenstates with the same

        <slide>
          <slideno>6</slideno>
          <text>Finally, we need to add |)and |)to nd the total vector: 
(1) =L) 
Example: Degenerate TLS 
Consider the Hamiltonian H = z + x. We already solved this Hamiltonian, both directly and with TIPT. 
Now consider the case   0 and a slightly modied Hamiltonian: 
H = (0 + )|0)(0|+(0 )|1)(1|+ x = 011+z + x. 
1We could solve exactly the system for  = 0, simply nding E0,1 = 0  and |)0,1 = |)=  (|0)|1)). We 2
can also apply TIPT.
 
However the two eigenstates |0), |1)are (quasi-)degenerate thus we need to apply degenerate perturbation theory. In
 
particular, any basis arising from a rotation of these two basis states could be a priori a good basis, so we need rst
 to obtain the correct zeroth order eigenvectors. In this very simple case we have H
d = H (the total Hilbert space)
 
and H = 0, or in other words, Qd = 11, Pd = 0. We rst need to dene an equation in the degenerate subspace only:
d 
(k Ud)|k)= 0 
where Ud = QdVQd. Here we have: Ud = V = x. Thus we obtain the correct zeroth order eigenvectors from 
diagonalizing this Hamiltonian. Not surprisingly, they are: 
 (0) (0)k V |h) k(0) (h|V |ki)|h)+  L j k) (h|V i
E0 (0) (ui uj ) j (0) (0)E Ed h j=i d)
kEh h/Hd 
)
(0)(k|V |h)j|h)+  L 
(ui j=i)L(h|V |ki)
(0)E0 (1) (0) k =j kuj ) Ed h h/Hd 
(0) 
0,1)
= 1 |)=  (|0)|1)). 2
with eigenvalues: E0,1 = 0 . We can now consider higher orders, from the equation: 
(H0 + V)|k)= Ek |k) 
with H0 = 011+x and V= 0. Thus in this case, there are no higher orders and we solved the problem. 
Example: Spin-1 system 
We consider a spin-1 system (that is, a spin system with S=1 dened in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space). The matrix 
representation for the angular momentum operators Sx and Sz in this Hilbert space are: 

 0 1 0 
1 0 1 
, Sz =   1 0 0 
0 0 0 1 S
x = 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 
The Hamiltonian of the system is H = H0 + V with 
= S2; V = Sx + Sz H0 z 
Given that

          <text>A. Rayleigh scattering 
Rayleigh scattering describes elastic scattering, for which k = k since |Af )= |Ai). Then we can simplify the cross 
section: 
2 
d (dih  k)(dhi  k) (dih  k)(dhi  k) = k4 + d i h + hk i h hkh 
At long wavelengths hk  h i, thus we can neglect k in the denominator. Then 
2 
d  
d  4 
k 2 
h (dih  k)(dhi 
i h  k) 
and simplifying we obtain that 
d  
d   4 
k 
This expression could have been found from the classical cross section we presented earlier, in the same limit   0. 
The Rayleigh scattering has a very strong dependence on the wavelength of the e.m. wave. This is what gives the 
blue color to the sky (and the red color to the sunsets): more scattering occurs from higher frequencies photons (with shorter wavelength, toward the blue color). 
As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, 
orange and yellow light is aected by the air. However, much of the shorter wavelength light is scattered in dierent 
directions all around the sky. Whichever direction one looks, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since the 
blue light is seen from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.Closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color, since the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions and the color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white. As the sun begins to set, the light must 
travel farther through the atmosphere. More of the light is reected and scattered and the sun appears less bright. 
The color of the sun itself appears to change, rst to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered and only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches the eyes. Finally, clouds appear white, since the water droplets that make up the cloud are much larger than 
the molecules of the air and the scattering from them is almost independent of wavelength in the visible range. 
B. Resonant Scattering 
An interesting case arises when the incident photon energy matches the dierence in energy between the atoms 
initial state and one of the intermediate levels. This phenomenon can occur both for elastic or inelastic scattering (Rayleigh or Raman). Assume that h
k = h i for a particular h in the sum over all possible intermediate levels. 
(2) Then, only rst term important in K(describing rst absorption and then emission) is important. In order to 1 
keep this term nite, we introduce a nite width of the level,  . The cross section then reduces to: 
2d (dfh  k )(dhi  k) |(dfh  k )(dhi  k)|2 
= kk 3 = kk 3 
d h i hk ih/2 (h i hk)2 + h2 2/4 :khi :khi 
This cross section describes Raman resonance and, for k = k  resonance uorescence. 
12.4.4 Photoelectric Eect 
In this section we want to use scattering theory of a photon from electron(s) in an atom to explain the photoelectric eect. We consider the case of an hydrogen-like atom with atomic number Z and we calculate the dierential cross

This gives the structure factor (hQ2)
Ss(Q, ) =    2m

d 2b kf (hQ2)

Since Q =  ki, we have Q2 = k2 + k2  2kikf cos. Also,  =  Ei and k2 = 2mEa  2AEa where we kf if Ef a 
substituted A for the mass of the nucleus. 
We can then integrate the cross-section over the solid angle, to nd d :dE

This expression for the cross section can also be obtained more simply from an energy conservation argument. 
Example II: Scattering from a crystal lattice 
We consider now the scattering of neutrons from a crystal. For simplicity, we will consider a one-dimensional crystal 
lattice modeled as a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator. The position r  x (in 1D) of a nucleus in the lattice is then 
the position of an harmonic oscillator of mass M and frequency 0, 
J 
h ) x = ( a + a 2M0 
with evolution given by the Hamiltonian 
2pM2 102 H = + x = h0(a a + )2M 2 2
If we consider no variation of isotope and spin for simplicity, we only need the self-intermediate structure function is 
1iQx(0)iQx(t) iQ[x(0)x(t)] +[Qx(0),Qx(t)] 2 FS (Q, t) = e e = e e 
First remember that 
p(0) x(t) = x(0)cos(0t)+ sin( 0t)M0 
i:for an harmonic oscillator. Then [x (0),x(t)] = [x(0),p(0)] 1 sin(0t) = sin( 0t). Also we have M0 M0 
p(0) J

          <text>Intermediate Scattering Function 
From the expressions above for the structure factors, it is clear that they can be obtained as the Fourier Transform 
(with respect to time) of the quantities: 
1 iQr(0)iQrx(t)FS (Q, t) = e eN x 
and 
1 iQrx(0)iQry(t)F (Q, t) = e eN x,y 
These are called the intermediate scattering functions. Going even further, we can write even these function as a Fourier Transform (with respect to position). For example, for equivalent targets (no distribution in isotope nor spin), we have 
iQr(0)iQr(t)FS (Q, t) = e e
By dening a the position of a test particle, n(R, t) = (R r(t)), we can calculate the fourier transform n(Q, t): 
I 
d3 iQR iQr(t)n(Q, t) = re n(R, t) = e
Then we have FS (Q, t) = (n(Q, t)n(Q, 0)). We can as well dene the van-Hove space-time self correlation function, 
I 
   Gs(r, t) = d3 r (n(r, 0)n(r + r ,t)) 
which represents a correlation of the test particle in space-time. The intermediate scattering function is obtained from G
s as 
FS (Q, t) = I 
d3 reiQr Gs(r, t) 
These nal relationship makes it clear that FS is the Fourier transform (with respect to space) of the time-dependent 
correlation of the test particle density, n(R, t), which only depends on the target characteristics. 
Example I: Resting, free nucleus 
We consider the scattering from one resting free nucleus. We need only consider the self dynamics factor and we have 
bc = b = b: 
d 2 kf b kf = b2S(Q, ) = S(Q, )d d ki 2h ki 
where we introduced the bound cross section b = 4b2 (with units of an area). Since the nucleus is free, the 
intermediate function is very simple. From 
iQr(0)iQr(t)FS (Q, t) = e e
we can use the BCH formula to write 
iQ[r(0)r(t)]+1 [Qr(0),Qr(t)] 2 FS (Q, t) = e 
Then we want to calculate [r (0),r(t)] in order to simplify the product of the two exponential. For a free particle, 
r(t) = r(0)+ p t and [r(0),p] = ih. Then we have m 
iQ[r(0)r(t)]+i Q2 t iQp/m +i Q2 t2m 2m FS (Q, t) = e = e e

          <text>12.4.2 Rayleigh Scattering of X-rays 
Rayleigh scattering usually describes elastic scattering by low energy radiation. It describes for example visible light 
(2) scattering from atoms: in that case, the predominant contribution comes from the term K. Rayleigh scattering 1 
also describes coherent, elastic scattering of x-rays from atoms (e.g. in a crystal) and is an important process in x-ray 
diraction. 
In the case of x-ray scattering, the photon energy is larger then the electronic excitation energy: h  Eb. Then 
(2) (1) (2) we have, as stated above, K Kand we can neglect the Kcontribution. As we are considering now bound 1 2 1 
dEf L 3 k 2 electrons, the recoil is zero, and = hc. Then the density of states is simply (Ef ) = d.dk 2 :c The cross section is given by 
(1) d =2 |K|2 (Ef ) =2 c2r2 ( 2h )2 1 ( L )3 k 2 
|k  k  |2|(Af | e ri |Ai)|2 2 e i q
d h c/L3 d h c/L3 L3 kk 2 hc i 
2 k i q= re (   ) 
|k  k  |2|(Af | e ri |Ai)|2 
 i 
Consider an elastic scattering process (the inelastic scattering is called Raman scattering for x-rays). If the incoming 
x-ray is unpolarized, we have 
2d re i q= (1+cos 2 )|(g| e ri |g)|2 
d 2 i 
i qWe dene f(p) = (g|L
i eri |g)the atomic form factor.
 
1) Notice that for p  0 |(g|L1|g)|2 = Z2 (the atomic number squared). Thus in general we expect Rayleigh
 i 
scattering to be weaker for lighter elements. 
2) In general we can rewrite the sum as an integral L
i ei q ri   
ei q r(r)d3r using the charge density  (r) = L(r ri). Then the atomic form factor takes the form: i 
f(p) = (g| I 
e i q r(r)d3 r |g)= I 
e i q r(r)d3 r 
with (r) = (g|(r)|g). Then the atomic form factor is the Fourier transform of the charge density. 
Scattering from a crystal 
In a crystal, we can rewrite the electron positions with the substitution ri  Rl +rli, where Rl is the atom position 
(or the nucleus position or the atomic center of mass position). Then we need to sum over all atoms and all electrons 
in the atom. Then we have the structure factor: 
G(q) = (g|e i qRle i q ril |g)= fl(q)e i qRl 
l,i l 
with fl = (g|L
i ei q ril |g).
 
In a crystal we can rewrite the atom position as Rlj = l1a1 + l2a2 + l3a3 + rj . Then
 
unit cell "vVJ " vV J

lj " vV J l1 ,l2,l3F (q) 
F (q) is the form factor for the unit cell, which is tabulated for dierent crystals. The cross section can be written as: 
2d r sin2(N1qa1/2) sin2(N2qa2/2) sin2(N3qa3/2) e = (1+cos 2 )|F (q)|2 
d 2 sin2(qa1/2) sin2(qa2/2) sin2(qa3/2) 
Only when qan = 2h the interferences terms do not vanish: this is Braggs diraction law.

          <text>12.4.3 Visible Light Scattering 
When considering visible light, the wavelength is large compared to the atomic size. Then, instead of using the full 
interaction V1 +V2 we can safely substitute it with the electric dipole Hamiltonian41 , V = dk Ek. This Hamiltonian 
does not produce any two-photon process to rst order, so in this case we need to consider the term K(2). This term 
involves virtual transitions. Since the duration of these transitions is very small, we do not have to worry about 
conservation of energy. Recall: 
K(2) (f|V |h)(h|V1 |i)= ,Ei Ehh 
k where V = dk E. The intermediate states are either |h)= |Ah)|0k0k  )or |h)= |Ah)|1k1k  ). It would be of 
course possible to derive the scattering cross section from the vector-potential/momentum Hamiltonian, and in that 
(1) (2) case both terms K2 and K1 should be included 42 . 
The electric eld in the Lorentz gauge is 
J 
2hE = (
iR + a iRf 
, ae e L3 
, 
and thus we obtain for (h|V1 |i)and (f|V1 |h): 
-(0k1k  |(
aeiR + a iRf 
|0k0k  )= eik  R,k e
-(0k0k  |(
aeiR + a eiRf 
|1k0k  )= eikR,k 
 -(0k1k  |(
aeiR + a iRf 
|1k1k  )= eikR,k e
-(1k1k  |(
aeiR + a  eiRf 
|1k0k  )= eik  R,k 
thus we have 
2h (Af |d  k |Ah)(Ah|d  k |Ai) (Af |d  k |Ah)(Ah|d  k |Ai) (2) i(kk  )RK= kk e +1 L3 i h + hk i + hk (h + hk + hk )h h 
WThe scattering cross section is given as usual by d = . and the density of state (assuming no recoil) is d  c/L3 
( L )3 k 2 
(Ef ) = d. 2 hc 
Finally the cross section is given by: 
2 
d 2 ( 2h)2 ( L )3 k 2 L3 (dfh  k )(dhi  k) (dfh  k)(dhi  k ) = kk + d h L3 2 hc c i h + hk i h hk

41 A unitary transformation changes the Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian into an expansion in terms of multipoles of the electro
magnetic elds. For atomic interactions, only the electric dipole is kept, while higher multipoles, such as magnetic dipole and 
electric quadrupole, can be neglected. This unitary transformation is describe, e.g., in Cohen-Tannoudjis book, Atom-Photons Interactions

K(1) is proportional to A2, but we only retain terms that link the correct modes ( k, k  ) and that are responsible for2 
 the annihilation of a photon in mode k and the creation of a photon of mode k  . These are terms ak ak. We nd:

We now use the equality k = c|k|and kk kk  = k q = p/h (the electron recoil momentum) to simplify the expression.k
Thus we obtain: 2 2e2hc (1) i q K=  k k  kk  (Af |e r |Ai)(0k1k  |akak  |1k0k  ),2 2mc L3 kk 
(1)where the last inner product is just equal to 1. We can now extend Kto many electrons:2 
2e2hc (1) i qK2 = (f|V2 |i)=  k k  kk  (Af | e ri |Ai). 2mL3 kk 
i 
This is the rst contribution to the scattering matrix element, rst order in perturbation theory from the quadratic 
term in the eld potential. 
(2)We now want to calculate K, the second order contribution from the linear part V1 of the potential:1 
(2) (f|V1 |h)(h|V1 |i)K= 1 Ei Ehh 
Note that this term describes virtual transitions to intermediate states since from rst order transitions V1 can only 
(2)create or annihilate one photon at a time. So there are two possible processes that contribute to K,1 
- rst absorptionof one photon in the k mode followed by creation of one photon in the k    mode: the intermediate 
state is zero photons in these two modes. 
- rst creation of one photon in the k    mode followed by annihilation of the photon in mode k: the intermediate 
state is one photon in each mode. 
Explicitly we have: 
(2) (Af |(0k1k  |V1 |0k0k  )|Ah)(Ah|(0k0k  |V1 |1k0k  )|Ai)K1 = i h + hkh 
(Af |(0k1k  |V1 |1k1k  )|Ah)(Ah|(1k1k  |V1 |1k0k  )|Ai)+ i + hk (h + hk + hk )h 
(2) (1)Notice that Khas an extra factor  k in the denominator with respect to K. Thus at higher energies of the1 2 
(2) (1)incident photon (such as x-ray scattering) only Ksurvives, while at lower energies (optical regime) Kis more1 2 
important.

          <text>12.2 Emission and Absorption 
Atoms and molecules can absorb photons and make a transition from their ground state to an excited level. From 
the excited state, they can emit photons (either in the presence or absence of a preexisting e.m. led) and transition 
to a lower level. Using TDPT and the quantization of the eld we can calculate the transition rates. 
12.2.1 Emission 
|e,n&gt; 
|g,n+1&gt; 
Fig. 21: Model for emission: the atom (molecule) makes a transition from the excited level ( |e) to the ground state ) |g) while 
the number of photons in the mode k,  goes from n to n +1. 
The rate of emission is given simply by 
2 W = |(f|V |i)|2(Ef ). h 
We separate the eld and the atom (or molecule) levels: 
|i)= |nk)|e), |f)= |nk +1)|g) 
As we are looking at atomic/optical processes the dipolar approximation is adequate and the interaction is given by: 
kk kV = d  E = ek r  E. Remember the expression for the electric eld: 
J 
2hk k(
ikr ikr f
k E = ake + ake k L3 
k, 
The position of the electron which makes the transition can be written as k r = Rk+ k, where Rkis the nucleus position. 
Since the relative position of the electron with respect to the nucleus is   , we can neglect it and substitute r 
with R in the exponential (  k kk  1). This simplies the calculation, since R is not an operator acting on the electron 
state. Then, from the rate: 
2 k W = |(g|dk|e)(nk +1|E |nk)|2(Ef )h 
we obtain 
2 (2e)2 (
ikR ikRf 
|nk)(g|k W = k , (nk +1|ak  e + ak  e r  k , |e) (Ef )L3 
k , 
Since we are creating a photon, only terms  a survive and specically the term with the correct wavevector and polarization: (nk +1|a |nk)= nk +1(all other terms are zero). Then we have: k 
(2e)22W = k,(nk, +1)|(g|k r  k, |e)|(Ef )L3 
Since the atom is left in a specic nal state, the density of states is dened by the e.m. eld: 
(Ef )dEf = (hk)hdk

Fermi Potential 
To rstorder, we can approximate T byV ,the nuclearpotentialin thecenterof massframe(ofthe neutron+nucleus). 
You might recall that the nuclear potential is a very strong (V 0  30MeV) and narrow ( r0  2fm) potential. These 
characteristics seem to preclude a perturbative approach, since the assumption of a weak interaction (compared to 
the unperturbed system energy) is not satised. Still, the fact that the potential is narrow means that the interaction 
only happens for a very short time. Thus, if we average over time, we expect a weak interaction. More precisely, the 
scattering interaction only depends on the so-called scattering length a, which is on the order a  V0r0. If we keep a 
constant, dierent combinations of V, r will give the same scatteringbehavior.We can thus replace the strong nuclear 
potential with a weaker, pseudo-potential V0, provided this has a much longer range  r0, such that a  V0r0 = V0r0. 
We can choose V0, r0 so that the potential is weak (eV) but the range is still short compared to the wavelength 
of the incoming neutron, kr0  1. Then, it is possible to replace the potential with a simple delta-function at the 
origin.

12.1 Scattering Theory 
We want to describe the interaction of radiation with matter as a scattering process. Specically, we are interested 
in calculating the rate of scattering (and then the cross section), which is nothing else than the transition rate from an initial state (initial state of the matter + incoming particle) and a nal state (nal state of the target + outgoing 
radiation)
39 . 
This is a problem that can be solved by TDPT. Instead of considering a constant perturbation as done to derive 
Fermis Golden rule, we analyze the case of a scattering potential, in its most general form. We describe a scattering

event as a particle coming close to a target or a medium, interacting with it and then being deected away. Thus, as a function of time, the interaction Hamiltonian V varies as in the gure 20. 
39 A very good resource for scattering theory is Chen, S.H.; Kotlarchyk, M., Interactions of Photons and Neutrons with 
Matter, (2007), which we follow closely in this chapter.

12.3 Wigner-Weisskopf Theory 
12.3.1 Interaction of an atom with a single mode e.m. eld 
Recall what we studied in Section 10.5. We consider again a two-level system (an atom) interacting with a single 
mode of the e.m. eld. The Hamiltonian simplies to H = H0 + V , with 
H0 = ha a + h z , V = hg(+a + a )2 
1 where g = 2:L3J d   is the dipole operator. 
We move to the interaction frame dened by the H0 Hamiltonian, U = eiH0t, then HI = UV U or 
HI = hge ita a e izt/2(+a + a )e ita a e izt/2 = hg 
e i()t+a + e i()ta  
We will use the notation  =  . We want now to study the evolution of a pure state in the interaction frame: 
ih  = HI |). We can write a general state as |)= L n(t)|e, n)+n(t)|g, n). Notice that since we have a TLS, n 
+ |e)= 0 and  |g)= 0. The evolution is then given by: 
ih n |e, n)+ n |g, n)= hg 
na e it |e, n)+ n+ae it |g, n) 
n n 
 it it= hg 
nen +1|g, n +1)+ ne n |e, n 1) 
n 
We then project these equations on (e, n|and (g, n|: 
 it ihn = hgn+1(t)e n +1 
itihn = hgn1(t)e  n 
to obtain a set of equations:  it { n = ign+1e n +1  it n+1 = igne n +1 
This is a closed system of dierential equations and we can solve for n, n+1.
 
For example: we can assume that initially the atom is in the excited state |e)and it decays to the ground state |g)
(that is,n(0) = 0, n). Then we have:
 
( nt ) i ( nt )
it/2n(t) = n(0)ecos  sin2 n 2

Since the photons emitted can have any polarization  and any wavevector kk direction, we have to sum over all

possiblepolarization vectors areperpendicular to k, as inFig. 22. Therate isthe sum ofthe ratesforeachpolarization

          <text>12.4 Scattering of photons by atoms 
In this section we want to study the scattering of photons by electrons (either free electrons or in an atom). We
 
previously studied similar processes:
 
- Scattering theory (with an example for thermal neutrons)
 
- Emission and absorption of photons (in the dipole approximation)
 
Notice that these last processes only involved a single photon (either absorbed or emitted). Now we want to study
 
the scattering of photons, meaning that there will be an incoming photon and an outgoing photon: this is a process
 
that involves two photons.

In order to study atom-photon interaction we need of course to start from the quantized e.m. eld: 
p2 11 (eA )2 1 H = + h(n + ) = p  + h(n + )2m 2 2m c 2

More generally, if there are many electrons, the interaction Hamiltonian is given by 
2e eV =  [pi  A(ri)+A(ri) pi]+ A(ri)2 
2mc 2mc2
i 
eWe already used the rst term (in the dipole approximation p  A  d  E) to nd emission and absorption mc processes. As stated, these processes only involve one photon. How do we obtain processes that involve two photons? 
Since from the term p  A and in the rst order perturbation theory we do not get them, we will need 
i) either terms A2, or 
ii) second order perturbation for the term  p  A. 
f2( 
eNotice that both these choices yield transitions that are  2 = 2 , that is, that are second order in the ne :c 
structure constant. 
2 (2) (1) Thus we want to calculate scattering transition rates given by W = |K+ K|2(Ef ), where : 1 2

(1) Kis instead zero, since it only connects state that dier by one photon (thus its not a scattering process) and we 1 
neglect higher orders than the second.
 
The initial and nal eigenstates and eigenvalues are as follow (where  indicate the photon):

          <text>Given the rate, we can also calculate the power emitted, as rate times energy 
4k 4 
d2 
3 c3 ge P = hkAe = 
Notice that this is very similar to the power emitted by a classical oscillating dipole (as if the e.m. eld was emitted 
by orbiting electrons). 
Stimulated Emission 
In the stimulated emission, W k = nkW k . Only photons with the same frequency ( kk) and polarization of the st sp 
ones already in the eld can be emitted. Then, as more photons in a particular mode are emitted, it becomes even 
more probable to produce photons in the same mode: we produce a beam of coherent photons (i.e. all with the same 
characteristics and phase coherent with each other). If the atoms can be kept in the excited (emitting) levels, we 
obtain a LASER (light amplication by stimulated emission of radiation). Of course, usually it is more probable to 
have the photons absorbed than to have it cause a stimulated emission, since at equilibrium we usually have many 
more atoms in the ground state than in the excited state, ng  ne. A mechanism capable of inverting the population 
of the atomics states (such as optical pumping) is then needed to support a laser. 
12.2.2 Absorption 
The rate of absorption is obtained in a way very similar to emission. The result is 
2 3 k k k W = |(e|dk|g)(nk|E |nk +1)|2(Ef ) = nk|k k  deg |2d h 2hc3
 (as(nk|ak |nk +1)= nk). 
12.2.3 Blackbody Radiation 
We consider a cavity with radiation in equilibrium with its wall. Then the polarization and kk-vector of the photons 
is random, and to obtain the total absorption rate we need to integrate over it, as done for the emission. We obtain 
I 4 3 
k d2 
 3hc3Wab = Wab()d = nk ge 
for a given frequency (and wavevector length). Similarly, the total emission is obtained as the sum of spontaneous 
and stimulated emission: 
4 k 3 
d2 
3hc3ge 
In these expression nk is the number of photons in the mode k. Since we assumed to be at equilibrium, nk depends 
only on the energy density at the associated frequency k. The energy density is given by the energy per volume, 
where the energy is given by the total number of photons times their energy, E = nk(k)hk: We = Wst + Wsp = (nk +1) 
u(k) = hk(k)nk/L3 
3 L3LThen, from the density of states (k) = 2 2  
d = 32 2, we obtain 2c c
2 3cnk = u(k)h3 
k 
The ratescan then be written in terms of the energydensity and ofEinsteins coecients for absorptionand emission:

          <text>a  A+1 We can also dene the bound scattering length , b = mn A , were mn is the neutrons mass and A the nucleus 
mass number. Then the potential is 
2h2 
V (r) = a(r) mn 
Note that b (interaction length or bound scattering length) is a function of the potential strength and range, which 
depend on the isotope from which the neutron is scattered o. 
22:Then to rst order the transition matrix is Tfi = b, or more generally, if there are many scatterers, each at a mn 
position rx(t), we have: 
2h2 
iQrx(t)Tfi(t) = bxemn x 
The scattering cross section becomes 
d 2 I    
1 kf ifit iQrx(0)iQry(t)= e b xbye ed d 2 ki  x,y 
Notice that since the collisions are spin-dependent, we should average over isotopes and spin states and replace bxby 
with bxby. 
Scattering Lengths 
Notice that b does not depend explicitly on position, although the position determines which isotope/spin we should 
2 consider. What is bxby? We have two contributions. For x = y this is b2x,y, while for x y, it is b (1x,y = ). We 
2 2 then write bxby = (b2 b )x,y +b = b2 
i +b2 which denes the coherent scattering length bc = b and the incoherent c 
2 scattering length b2 = b2 b . If there are N scatterers, we have L bxby = N(bi 2 + b2). i c 
Structure Factors 
Using these denition, we arrive at a simplied expression: 
kf d 2 = N 
bi 2SS (Q, )+b2S(Q, ) 
cd d ki 
where we used the self-dynamic structure factor 
I   
1  
1 ifit iQrx(0)iQrx(t)SS (Q, ) = e e e2 N x 
which simplies to 
1 I  
ifit iQr(0)iQr(t)SS (Q, ) = e e e2  
if all nuclei are equivalent (same isotope), and the full dynamic structure factor 
1 I   
1  
ifit iQrx(0)iQry(t)S(Q, ) = e e e2 N x,y 
The structure factors depend only on the material properties. Thus they give information about the material when 
obtained from experiments.

12.4.1 Thomson Scattering by Free Electrons 
We consider rst the Thomson scattering, which is well described by the scattering by free electrons. In this case we 
consider thus one single electron. Also in general, the photon should have energy high enough that the electron is seen as free even if in reality it is part of an atom (thus the photon energy must be larger than the atoms ionization 
energy, h  E
I or in other terms   than the atoms size). Note that in Thomson scattering the nal electron is 
still a bound electron (elastic scattering) while in Compton scattering the electron is unbound (inelastic scattering). 
Still, since the binding energy is small compared to the other energy at play, the electron can be considered as a free 
electron, and many of the characteristics of Compton scattering still apply.

          <text>A. Types of Scattering 
Depending on the energy h of the incident photon (with respect to the ionization energy EI of the atom) and on 
the elastic or inelastic character of the scattering, the scattering process is designated with dierent names. 
-Rayleigh scattering (Low energy, Elastic): h  EI , |Eh EI |, Ef = EI . 
The nal state has the same energy as the initial one, Ef = Ei since the scattering is elastic. The scattering thus 
involve intermediate virtual levels, with energies Eh. We will nd a cross section  4 . 
-Raman scattering (Low energy, Inelastic): h  EI , Ef = EI . 
Usually the nal state is a dierent rotovibrational state of the molecule, so the energy dierence between initial 
and nal state is small. If Ef &gt; EI the scattering process is called Stokes, otherwise if Ef &lt; EI the scattering 
process is called anti-Stokes . 
-Thomson scattering (High energy, Elastic): h  EI , Ef = EI . 
This process is predominant for, e.g., soft x-ray scattering. This type of scattering can be interpreted in a semiclassical way, in the limit where the wavelength  is larger than the atomic dimensions,   a
0. The cross section 
8is then equivalent to what one would obtain for a free electron,  = r02 with r0 the eective electron radius. 3
-Compton scattering (High energy, Inelastic): h  EI ,   a0, Ef = EI . 
For very high energy, the wavelength is small compared to the atoms size and the energy is much larger than the electron binding energy, so that the nal state of the electron is an unbound state. Thus this scattering is very similar to Compton scattering (inelastic scattering) by a free electron. 
Note that for x-rayscatterings the classication is slightly dierent than the one given above. There are two processes 
that competes with Coulomb scattering even at the x-ray energies: 
- Electronic Raman scattering: an inelastic scattering process where the initial atomic state is the ground state and 
the nal state an excited, discrete electronic state. 
- Rayleigh scattering for x-rays: an elastic scattering process, where the nal atomic state is the same as the initial 
state, since there is no atom excitation. 
In addition to scattering processes, other processes involving the interaction of a photon with electrons are possible 
(besides absorption and emission of visible light that we already studied). In order of increasing photon energy, the interaction of matter with e.m. radiation can be classied as: 
Rayleigh/Raman Photoelectric Thomson Compton Pair 
Scattering Absorption Scattering Scattering Production 
h &lt; E
I h EI h  EI h  mec2 h &gt; 2mec2 
eV keV keV MeV MeV 
Visible X-rays X-rays -rays hard -rays 
B. Semi-classical description of scattering 
A classical picture is enough to give some scaling for the scattering cross section. We consider the eects of the interaction of the e.m. wave with an oscillating dipole (as created by an atomic electron). 
The electron can be seen as being attached to the atom by a spring, and oscillating around its rest position with 
frequency 
0. When the e.m. is incident on the electron, it exerts an additional force. The force acting on the electron 
is F = eE(t), withE(t) = E0 sin(t) the oscillating electric eld. This oscillating driving force is in addition to the 
attraction of the electron to the atom  kxe, where k (given by the Coulomb interaction strength and related to 
the binding energy EI ) is linked to the electrons oscillating frequency by 02 = k/me. The equation of motion for 
the electron is then e mexe = kxe eE(t)  xe + 02 xe =  E(t) me 
We seek a solution of the form xe(t) = A sin(t), then we have the equation 
e 1 e (2 + 02)A =  E0  A = E0 me me2 2

          <text>Scattering Rate 
The rate of scattering is given by the expression found earlier: 
2 Wfi = |(f|T |i)|2(Ef Ei)h 
As usual, we want to replace, if possible, the delta-function with the nal density of states. However, only the
 
radiation will be left in a continuum of states, while the target will be left in one (of possibly many) denite state.
 
To describe this distinction, we separate the nal state into the two subsystems.
 
We rst dene the partial projection on radiation states only, Tkf,ki = (kf |T |ki). By writing the delta function as
 
an integral we have:
 
2  1 I  
i(fi)t i(fi)t/:Wfi = (mf |Tkf,ki |mi)(mi|T |mf ) e ekf,ki h 2h  
Now, since eiHRt/: |mi)= eiit/: |mi)(and similarly for |mf )we can rewrite 
(mf |Tkf,ki |mi)e i(fi)t/: = (mf |e iHRt/:Tkf,kie iHRt/: |mi)= (mf |Tkf,ki(t)|mi) 
and obtain a new expression for the rate as a correlation of transition events: 
1 I  
Wfi = e i(fi)t (mi|Tk 
f,ki(0)|mf )(mf |Tkf,ki(t)|mi)h2  
Final density of states 
The nal density of states describe the available states for the radiation. As we assumed that the radiation is 
represented by plane waves (and assuming for convenience they are contained in a cavity of edge L), the nal density 
of states is ( L )3 
(kf )d3kf = kf 2dkf d 2 
We can express this in terms of the energy, (k)d3k = (E)dEd. For example, for photons, which have k = E/hc 
we have ( L )3 E2 ( L )3 2 
k(E) = 2 = 22 h3c3 2 hc3 
:2 k2 where the factor 2 takes into account the possible polarizations. For neutrons (or other particles such that E = ): 2m 
 ( L )3 k ( L )3 2mE (E) = = 2 h2 2 h3 
If the material tar get can be left in more than one nal state, we sum over these nal states f. Then the average 
rate is given by W S = LWfi(E)dEd (assuming that Wfi does not change very much in d and dE). f 
Incoming Flux 
#The incoming ux is given by the number of scatterer per unit area and unit time,  = . In the cavity considered, At vwe can express the time as t = L/v, thus the ux is  = . For photons, this is simply  = c/L3, while for massive L3 
:kparticles (neutrons) v = hk/m, yielding  = mL3 .

          <text>We want to calculate the probability of scattering from an initial state to a nal state: 
I 
Pscatt = |(f|UI (t)|i)|2 = |(f|(11i VI (t  )dt  + ... )|i)|2 
 
Notice that we consider negative times as well. This corresponds to the so-called adiabatic switching , since the 
interaction is assumed to be turned on slowly from the beginning of time and to go down to zero again for long times. 
A. Scattering and Transition matrices 
In scattering problems, the propagator UI is usually called the scattering matrix S. To simplify the calculation, we 
can assume again that V is actually time-independent. Then from the rst order TDPT we obtain: 
(f|S(1)|i) I  
ifitdt = = iVfi e 2i(f i)Vfi 
 
Now consider the second order contribution: 
 
t1 
(f|S(2)|i)  I  
ifmt1 I 
imit2= (f| V |m)(m|V |i) dt1e dt2e 
 m 
Notice that the last integral is not well dened for t  . To solve it, we rewrite it as 
t1 imit+tI 
i(mii)t2 et1 
0+  0+ mi i lim dt2e = lim i  
Now when taking the limit t   the exponential term et  0 (thus getting rid of the oscillations). Then we are 
left with only 
t1 i(mii)t1I eimit2dt2e = lim i 
 0+ mi i 
and we obtain (setting now  = 0) 
(f|S(2)|i) I  ei(fii)t1 (f|V |m)(m|V |i) = i  
VfmVmi dt1 = 2i(f i) 
 mi i i m m m 
Looking at the rst and second order of the scattering matrix, we start seeing a pattern emerge. We can thus rewrite 
: 
(f|S |i) = 2i(f i)(f|T |i) 
where T is called the transition matrix . Its expansion is given by: 
(f|V |m)(m|V |i) VfmVmnVni(f|T |i) = (f|V |i)+  
+  
+ ... i m (i m)(i n)m m,n 
B. Scattering Probability 
We can now turn to calculate the scattering probability: PS = |(f|S |i)|2. In order to obtain the total scattering 
probability, we will need to consider all possible nal states. We found: 
Ps = 42|(f|T |i)|22(f i)

          <text>2ig n +1 ( nt )
it/2n(t) = n(0)e sinn 2 
with 2 = 2 +4g2(n +1). If initially there is no eld (i.e. the e.m. eld is in the vacuum state) then 0(0) = 1, n 
while n(0) = 0 n = 0. Then there are only two components that are dierent than zero: 
( 0t) i ( 0t )
it/20(t) = ecos  sin2 J
2 +4g2 2 
2ig ( 0t)
it/21(t) = e sinJ
2 +4g2 2 
Thus, even in the absence of eld, it is possible to make the transition from the ground to the excited state! In the 
semiclassical case (where the eld is treated as classical) we would have no transition at all. The oscillations obtained 
in the quantum case are called the vacuum Rabi oscillations. 
12.3.2 Interaction with many modes of the e.m. eld 
In analyzing the interaction of an atom with a single mode of radiation we found that transitions can occur only if 
energy is conserved. In the real world however we are always confronted with a nite linewidth of any transition. In 
order to nd the linewidth we need to look at a multi-mode eld. 
Consider the same Hamiltonian as used in the previous section, but now we treat a eld with many modes. The 
interaction Hamiltonian in the interaction frame is given by 
 i(k)t i(k)tVI = h gkak+e + gka ek
k 
We consider a case similar to the one consider at the end of the previous section, where initially the e.m. eld is in 
the vacuum state and the atomic transition creates one photon. Now, however, this photon can be in one of many 
modes. The state vector is then: 
|(t))= (t)|e, 0)+ k |g, 1k)
k 
(now the index k in k label the mode and not the photon number) and the initial conditions are (0) = 1, k(0) = 0, 
k. The system of equations for the coecients are 
{ 
(t) = i L
k gkei(k)tk(t) 
k(t) = igkei(k)t(t) 
If we consider this transition as a decay process from the excited to the ground state, |(t)|2 gives the decay 
probability. To solve for (t) we rst integrate : 
t(I )
 i(k)t i(k)t = i gke igke  (t  )dt 
0k 
We can rewrite the expression as: 
t   =  |gk|2 I 
dt  e i(k)(t t)(t  ) 
0k 
Assumption 1) We assume that the modes of the e.m. form a continuum, so that we can replace the sum by an integral L
k 3L 
(k)d3k, with the density of states set by k = ck as usual: (k)d3k = 2 k2dk d sind.2

          <text>Then the structure factor, which is the Fourier transform of FS will be a sum of Dirac functions at frequencies 
 = n0 corresponding to the n-phonon contribution to the scattering. Here the terms ( n0) correspond to 
scattering events where the energy has been transfered from the neutron to the oscillator, while terms ( + n0) 
describe a transfer of energy from the lattice to the neutron. The constant term yields () which describes no energy 
exchange or elastic scattering (zero-phonon term). Note that the expansion coecient, W0 can be expressed in terms 
kbT 2kbTof the temperature, since in the high temperature limit, (n) , from which W0 = . :0 M2 
0 
In the low temperature limit, (n) 0. Thus we have: 
 Q2 i0t Q2 Q2 i0 t 
2M0 {2(n)[1cos(0t)]+1e } Q2
2M0 e 2M0 eFS (Q, t) = e  e

Q2 Q2 hQ2 1 ( hQ2 )2 
i0t 2i0tFS (Q, t)e 2M0 1+ e + e + ... 2M0 2 2M0
Even at low temperature, the structure factor (the Fourier transform of the expression above) is a sum of Dirac 
function, also called a phonon expansion. However in this case only terms ( n0) appear, since energy can only 
be given from the neutron to the lattice (which is initially in its ground state).

          <text>where Wfi is the transition rate for the scattering event and inc is the incoming photon ux. The incoming photon 
ux can be calculated by assuming (for convenience) that the system is enclosed in a cavity of volume V = L3 (so 
that theres only one photon in that volume). The incoming ux of photons in the cavity is given by the number of 
photons per unit area and time: 
#photons 1 c  = = = time  Area L/cL2 L3 
where the area is L2 and the time to cross the cavity is t = L/c. The transition rate Wfi is given by Fermis Golden 
Rule, assuming an atom-photon interaction V and a density of nal state (Ef ): 
2 Wfi = |(f|V |i)|2(Ef )h 
Here the nal density of states (Ef ) is expressed in terms of the momentum p of the scattered electron and the 
solid angle d where it is ejected. Indeed, as the photon is absorbed, the nal density of states is only given by the 
free electron, again assumed to be enclosed in the volume V . The density of states for the electron is given by the 
density of momentum states in the cavity L3 assuming the electron propagates as a plane wave: 
( L )3 
(Ef )dEf = (p k)d3p k= p 2dpd 2h 
with the (non-relativistic) energy for the electron given by Ef = p2/(2m) giving dEf = pdp/m. Finally 
( L )3 
(Ef ) = mpd 2h 
e k We next want to calculate the transition matrix element (f|V |i), where V =  A  p k. The relevant states are mc 
the photon states 1 ) 
and 0) 
and the electron momentum eigenstates, which in t he position representation are k ki(k r) = (k r|ie)and f (k r) = (k r|fe).
 
The matrix element between the relevant states is then:
 
e 2hc2 ih r ih rVif =  (fe|(
0 ae + a e  p k1) 
|ie)k L3h h h h, kmc

 p k|ie)k h k k k h mL3h h 
h, 
The only surviving term is 
e J 
2h ikVif =  ( fe|e r k p |ie)k mL3k 
Then turning to the position representation of |ie), |fe)and of the momentum operator, we can calculate an explicit 
expression. Using i(k r) = (k r|ie), f (k r) = (k r|fe)and  p k=  (ih), we have: k k 
iI
k ik(fe|e r p k|ie)= d3k r  f  (k r)e r (ihi(k r)) k k 
V 
Finally 
e J 
2h I 
f (kik(f|V |i)=  d3k r   r)e r (ihi(k r)) k mL3k V 
The nal wave function f is just a plane wave with momentum k= p/h (in the volume L3). The initial wave q k
function is instead a bound state. You should have seen that for an hydrogen-like atom the wave function is given by

          <text>We calculate the square of the Dirac function from its denition based on the limit of the integral: 
1 I  1 I  t 2() = dteit() = dt() = lim ()2 2 t   
Then although the probability is not so well dened, since it contains a limit: 
Ps = lim 4t|(f|T |i)|2(f i) 
t 
the rate of scattering is well dened, since it is WS = PS /(2t): 
WS = 2|(f|T |i)|2(f i) 
This is the rate for one isolated nal state. If instead we have a continuum of nal states, with density of states (f ) 
we need to sum over all possible nal states: 
WS = 2 I 
2|(f|T |i)|2(f i)(f )df = 2|(f|T |i)|2(i) 
Notice that to rst order, this is equivalent to the Fermi Golden rule. 
12.1.1 Cross Section 
We now use the tools developed in TDPT to calculate the scattering cross section. This is dened as the rate of 
scattering divided by the incoming ux of particles: 
d 2WS (, E) d dE inc 
We consider a particle + medium system, where the particle is some radiation represented by a plane wave of 
momentum kk. In general, we will have to dene also other degrees of freedom denoted by the index , e.g for photons 
we will have to dene the polarization while for particles (e.g.e neutrons) the spin. 
The unperturbed Hamiltonian is H0 = HR +HM (radiation and medium). We assume that for t  the radiation 
and matter systems are independent, with (eigen)states: 
|i)= |ki,mi), |f)= |kf ,mf ) 
with energies: 
HR |ki)= hi |ki), HR |kf )= hf |kf ), HM |mi)= i |ki), HM |mf )= f |mf ) 
and total energies: Ei = hi + i and Ef = hf + f .

This allows two simplications: i) we can replace 3 with 3 in the integral, and ii) we can extend the lower integral

Notice that the decay rate is related to Einsteins emission rate, as  = Ae/4 as we should expect, since it is related 
to the total emission (at any frequency) from the excited to the ground state.

          <text>8.4 The Master Equation
 
8.4.1 Markov approximation 
In the case of coherent evolution, we nd it very convenient to characterize the dynamics of a quantum system with 
a Hamiltonian, which describes the evolution over an innitesimal time interval. The dynamics is then described by a dierential equation, the Schr odinger equation, and we may calculate the evolution over a nite time interval 
by integrating the equation, that is, by piecing together the evolution over many innitesimal intervals. It is often 
possible to describe the (not necessarily coherent) evolution of a density matrix, at least to a good approximation, by a dierential equation. This equation, the master equation, will be our next topic. In fact, it is not at all obvious that there need be a dierential equation that describes decoherence. Such a description will be possible only if the 
evolution of the quantum system is Markovian, or in other words, local in time. If the evolution of the density 
operator (t) is governed by a (rst-order) dierential equation in t, then that means that (t + dt) is completely 
determined by (t). 
In general the density operator 
A(t + dt) can depend not only on A(t), but also on A at earlier times, because 
the environment (reservoir) retains a memory of this information for a while, and can transfer it back to system. An open system (whether classical or quantum) is dissipative because information can ow from the system to the reservoir. But that means that information can also ow back from reservoir to system, resulting in non-Markovian 
uctuations of the system. 
Still, in many contexts, a Markovian description is a very good approximation. The key idea is that there may be a clean separation between the typical correlation time of the uctuations and the time scale of the evolution that we want tofollow.Crudely speaking, we maydenoteby t
E the time it takesforthereservoirto forgetinformationthat 
it acquired from the system. After time tE we can regard that information as forever lost, and neglect the possibility 
that the information may feed back again to inuence the subsequent evolution of the system. Our description of the evolution of the system will incorporate coarse-graining in time; we perceive the dynamics through a lter 
that screens out the high frequency components of the motion, with   1/t
coarse. An approximately Markovian 
description should be possible, then, if tE  tcoarse; we can neglect the memory of the reservoir, because we are 
unable to resolve its eects. This Markovian approximation will be useful if the time scale of the dynamics that 
we want to observe is long compared to tcoarse, e.g., if the damping time scale tdamp satises 
tdamp  tcoarse  tE 
8.4.2 Lindblad equation 
Our goal is to generalize the Liouville equation   = i[H,] to the case of Markovian but non-unitary evolution, for
 
which we will have   = L[]. The linear operator L, which generates a nite superoperator in the same sense that a
 
Hamiltonian H generates unitary time evolution, will be called the Lindbladian.
 
We can derive the Lindblad equation from an innitesimal evolution described by the Kraus sum representation,
 with the following steps:
 
1. From the Kraus sum we can write the evolution of  from t to t + t as: (t + t) = LM
k(t)(t)Mk  
k (t). 
2. Wenowtakethe limitofinnitesimaltime, t  0.Weonlykeeptermsupto rstorder in t, (t+t) = (t)+t .(0) (1) (2)This implies that the Kraus operator should be expanded as Mk = M+ tM+ tM+ ... .k k k 
Then there is one Kraus operator such that M0 =11+t(iH+K)+O(t2) with K hermitian (so that (t +t) 
is hermitian), while all others have the form: Mk = tLk + O(t), so that we ensure (t + t) = (t)+t:

k MkM 
k  
k = Tr{S 11}) = Tr
3. S (t) is positive.
 
In the special case where there is only one term in the sum, we revert to the unitary evolution of the density matrix.
 
In that case, a pure state, for example, would remain pure. If that is not the case, that is, the evolution is not unitary,
 
it means that in the course of the evolution the system S and bath B became entangled , so that A is in a mixed
 
state after partial trace. Because of the loss of unitarity, superoperators are in general not invertible and thus there
 
is a specic arrow of time.
 
A. Ancillary Bath 
In many cases it is not possible to fully calculate the evolution of the total system ( S +B) as either it is too large or 
we have imperfect knowledge of the bath. However, if we have a description of the system dynamics in terms of the 
operator sum, it is possible to always augment the system and nd a larger, composite system that evolves unitarily 
and yields the operator sum upon partial trace. The ancillary system might however not have all the characteristic 
of the (unknown) physical bath. What we are looking for is in fact a minimal description for the bath. 
We choose as ancillary Hilbert space HB a space of dimensions at least equal to the number of terms in the operator 
sum. This space will have then a set of orthonormal vectors {|k)}, and we can dene a normalized state |0)B on HB . 
Then the unitary evolution operator of the combined system is dened by imposing the relationship: 
USB (|)S |0)B ) = L
(Mk 11)(|)S |k)B , ) |)S  HS 
k 
This ensures that the evolution of the reduced system is given by the Kraus map. The total system evolution is: 
USB(S |0)(0|B )U = L
(Mk 11)|S ,k)(S ,h|(MSB  
h 11) 
k,h 
and upon taking the partial trace: 
 
L

j k,h 
L
(j|k)(h|j)(M 
k |)(|Mh) = 
j 
L 
j |)(|Mj S (t)M= 
j 
Although this relationship doesnt fully dene the operator on the full Hilbert space, we can extend the operator as desired. In particular we want it to be unitary (and this imposes added constraints). As the operator U
SB as dened 
above preserves the inner product on the full Hilbert space, a unitary extension of it to the full space does indeed exists. Furthermore, we can check that upon taking a partial trace on B we retrieve the operator sum as desired, 
for an initial pure state on S. But any density matrix can be expressed as an ensemble of pure states, hence this 
property is true for any general state on S.

For a non-Markovian environment where memory eects are present, we can describe the distribution q() as a 
Gaussian stochastic process, so that  = (cos) e (2)/2 = et2/T22 . For a Markovian process instead we have an 
t/T2 exponential decay  = e.

J
= dq()[cos2(/2)(0)+sin2(/2)z (0)z i cos(/2)sin(/2)(z (0)(0)z )] 
By evaluating the integral, and assuming again a symmetric distribution, we have: 
Sd() = (1p)(0)+pz(0)z 
1where p = J

8.5.2 Stochastic Wavefunctions 
The Monte Carlo wavefunction was derived simultaneously in the 1990s by two groups interested in very dier
ent questions. A group of scientists in France, Dalibard, Castin, and Mlmer, wanted to simulate laser cooling of 
atoms quantum mechanically in three dimensions. Their numerical solution required discretizing space into a grid of 
40x40x40 positions; to implement the master equation on such a space would have required a density matrix with O(40
6)  109 entries such calculations are beyond the scope of even modern computers. However, simulating a 
wavefunction with O(403) entries is quite feasible. Consequently the group sought to convert the master equation to 
something more like the Schr odinger equation29 . 
At the same time, Carmichael was interested in the eects that continuous monitoring would have on a system30 . 
For example, a two-level atom prepared in an equal superposition of states can decay by emitting a photon; if that photon is detected, the experimenter knows with certainty that the atom is in its ground state. But what happens 50% of the time when a photon is not detected? Certainly, after a long time has passed, the atom must be in its 
ground state, but how does that happen? To study these and similar questions, Carmichael wanted to incorporate 
the eects of continuos monitoring, and understand how a measurement can cause the system state to suddenly jump into a dierent state. 
The description on which both groups converged begins with the most general form of the master equation, 
d = i[H,]+L(),dt

Lk + LLk 2LkL).k k k2 k

condition, 
1 L 
L K =  
kLk. 2 k&gt;0 
4. Finally we substitute K in the equation above and take the limit   0: (t + dt) = (t) + dt. We thus obtain 
the Lindblad equation 
(
Lk(t)L 
k  (t)L kLk) ML 1 1 L kLk(t) (t)= L[] = i[H,(t)]+ 2 2 k=1 
The rst term in L[] is the usual Schr odinger term that generates unitary evolution (thus we identify the hermitian 
operator H with the usual Hamiltonian). The other terms describe the possible transitions that the system may 
undergo due to interactions with the reservoir. The operators Lk are called Lindblad operators or quantum jump 
operators. Each LkL k L kL kLk terms are term induces one of the possible quantum jumps, while the 1 
2Lk  1 
2needed to normalize properly the case in which no jumps occur.
 
If we recall the connection between the Kraus representation and the unitary representation of a superoperator, we
 clarify the interpretation of the master equation. We may imagine that we are continuously monitoring the reservoir,
 projecting it in each instant of time onto the |)basis. With probability 1 O(t), the reservoir remains in the state
E 
|0)E , but with probability of order t, the reservoir makes a quantum jump to one of the states |). When we sayE 
that the reservoirhas forgotten the information it acquired from the system (so that the Markovian approximation
 applies), we mean that these transitions occur with probabilities that increase linearly with time.
 
This is equation is also called the Kossakowski-Lindblad equation
26 .
 
The Lindblad equation above is expressed in the Schr odinger picture. It is possible to derive the Heisenberg picture
 
Lindblad equation, which has the form:
 
dx = i[H,x]+L 1 L 
kxLk  L kLkx + xL kLk ,dt 2 k 
where x is the observable under study.
 
Another way to express the Lindblad equation is for a vectorized density matrix:   = (H+G), with the generator
 
G: 
ML 1 1Lm  
mLm) (LLm G = Lm  11(L )11m2 2m=0 
and the Hamiltonian part will be given by H = i(H1111H). In this form, the Lindblad equation becomes a 
linear equation (a matrix multiplying a vector, if we are considering e.g. discrete systems). Thus it is easy to solve 
the dierential equation, nding: 
(t) = exp[( H+ G)t](0), 
where we identify the superoperator S = exp[(H+ G)t]. More details on how to convertfrom Kraus sum, to Lindblad 
to superoperator description of the open quantum system dynamics can be found in T. F. Havel, Robust procedures 
for converting among Lindblad, Kraus and matrix representations of quantum dynamical semigroups , J. Math. Phys. 
44, 534 (2003). 
A. Example: spin-1/2 dephasing 
Dephasing, or transverse relaxation, is the phenomenon associated with the decay of the coherence terms (o
diagonals) in the density matrix. In NMR, since the signal is due to the ensemble of spins, a coherence term which 
lasts forever would require all the same spins of the dierent molecules to precess about the magnetic eld at exactly the same rate. As previously mentioned, the frequency of a single spin depends on the local magnetic eld, which depends on the external eld, and on the eld created by the surrounding spins. Due to rapid tumbling, the average

t(

t(

S(, t) = te ||2 0 ||2 
thus any phase coherence is lost and the state reduces to a classical, incoherent superposition of populations. Because 
in this process phase coherence is lost (but the energy/population is conserved) the process is called dephasing and 
the time constant 1 / is usually denoted by T2. Then we have a representation of the superoperator, by expressing 
tt as a linear vector: S(, t) = S(t), where S = diag([1,e ,e , 1]). 
8.3.3 Depolarizing process 
The depolarizing channel is a model of a decohering qubit that has particularly nice symmetry properties. We can describe it by saying that, with probability 1 - p the qubit remains intact, while with probability p an error occurs. The error can be of any one of three types, where each type of error is equally likely. If {|0)|1)}is an orthonormal 
basis for the qubit, the three types of errors can be characterized as: 
1. Bit-ip error: |) 
x|) or |0)  |1)&amp; |1)  |0). 
2. Phase-ip error: |) z |) or |0)  |0)&amp; |1)  |1). 
3. Both errors: |) y|) or |0) i|1)&amp; |1)  i|0). 
If an error occurs, then |)evolves to an ensemble of the three states x|), y |), z|). 
The depolarizing channel can be represented by a unitary operator acting on HSE = HS  HE , where HE has 
dimension 4. The unitary operator USE acts as 
USE |)S |0)E  1p|)S |0)E+ 
 p+ [x|)S |1)E + y |)S |2)+ z |)S |3)]E E3 
The environment evolves to one of four mutually orthogonal states that keep a record of what transpired; if we 
could only measure the environment in the basis {|), = 0, 1, 2, 3}, we would know what kind of error had occurred 
(and we would be able to intervene and reverse the error). 
Kraus representation: To obtain an operator-sum representation of the channel, we evaluate the partial trace over 
the environment in the {|)E }basis. Then

coecient (t) from the noise generator HN . (t) is a random variable due to stochastic, time-dependent uctuating 
elds and HN is an operator which describes how these classical elds are coupled to the quantum system. 
We now introduce a superoperator L(t) dened on Liouville (operator) space via 
L(t) = Htot(t)1111Htot(t) = Ldet(t) + (t)LN

average over the microscopic trajectories of the system ((t)), we have to take the ensemble average superpropagator
 
to obtain ((t))= (
U)
(0). The problem of calculating the average of the exponential of a stochastic operator has
 
been solved by Kubo27 using the cumulant expansion.
 
First, expand the time-ordered average exponential S = (Texp(i J t dt  H(t  )))via the Dyson series:

(i)n + T J t dt1  J t dtn(H(t1)  H(tn))+  n!0 0 
Theterm (H(t1)  H(tn))is calledthe n-thmoment ofthedistribution.We want nowto expressthis samepropagator 
in terms of the cumulant function K(t), dened by: 
K(t)S = e 
The cumulant function itself can most generally be expressed as a power series in time: 
(it)n (it)2 
K(t) = L 
Kn = itK1 + K2 +  n! 2! n=1 
Expanding now the exponential using the expression above we have: 
1 2 (it)2 
S =11+K(t)+ (K(t)) +  =11itK1 + (K2 + K12)+ 2! 2! 
By equating terms of the same order in the two expansions we obtain the cumulants Kn in terms of the moments of 
order at most n. For example: 
t1 J 
K1 = dt  (
H(t  ))
t 0 
1 t tJ J 
= T dt1 dt2 (
H(t1)H(t2)) 
K2K2 1t2 0 0 
The propagator can therefore be expressed in terms of the cumulant averages:

c (

p)Pz . From the rotational symmetry, we see that P = (1 = (1 or P p) irrespective of the direction in which Pz 
points. Hence, the Bloch sphere contracts uniformly under the action of the channel; the spin polarization is reduced 
4 
3by the factor (1 p) (which is why we call it the depolarizing process). This result was to be expected in view of 
43 the observation above that the spin is totally randomized with probability p. 
Why do we say that the superoperator is not invertible? Evidently we can reverse a uniform contraction of the sphere 
with a uniform ination. But the trouble is that the ination of the Bloch sphere is not a superoperator, because it is not positive. Ination will take values of P  1 to values P &gt; 1, and so will take a density operator to an 
operator with a negative eigenvalue. Decoherence can shrink the ball, but no physical process can blow it up again! 
A superoperator running backwards in time is not a superoperator.

          <text>B. The superoperator preserves trace and hermiticity 
Since the density matrix trace has the property to describe the sum of the probabilities of all possible states in 
the ensemble, it is important that the trace be preserved. An exception can be made for operators that describe measurement (and not time evolution). In that case 0  Tr{}  1. In this case, Tr {}represent the probability 
that the measurement outcome described by the map M has occurred and the normalized nal state is /Tr{}. As 
more than one outcome of the measurement is possible, the probability of obtaining  might be less than one. 
The superoperator preserves the hermiticity of the density matrix: [M ()]
 = M() if  =  
C. Positivity and complete positivity 
The property of positivity means that the map is such that M() is non-negative if  is. Although this condition is 
enough to obtain a valid density matrix, it leads to a contradiction when we consider composite systems. Lets take a valid map M
1 on system 1. Then, if we consider a bipartite system and we apply the map M1 11 we would like 
to still obtain a density matrix on the composite system. Unfortunately, if the map is simply positive, this is not always the case. Thus, we require it to be completely positive. A map is completely positive if M
1 112 is positive 
for any extension H2 of the Hilbert space H1.

          <text>that is, we consider the expectation value of the operators Bk. In general we will also need to take an ensemble 
average over the random uctuating eld (Bk(t)), as we look at expectation values for the density operator. 
We can now make the assumption that (BE)E = 0, which implies (VI (t))E  TrE {VI (t)E(0)}= 0. This is not 
restrictive, since, if V is of the form V = AS BE with (BE)  = 0 we can replace V with V = AS (BE (BE)), E E
and simultaneously add AS (BE)to HS. With this condition, (V )E = 0 and since E(0) has the same form in both E 
Schr odinger and interaction pictures, the result holds in the interaction picture also. The same argument can be 
made if V = LAS, BE,. Then the second term in the equation above vanishes and we have  
t t11 J J 
S(t) = S(0)+ dt1 dt2 (TrE {[VI (t1), [VI (t2),I (t2)]]}). (il)2 0 0 
B. Assumption 1: Born approximation 
We can always write (in any picture) (t) = S(t)E(t) + correlation (t), which may be taken as a denition of 
correlation . Let us assume (as done in the previous section) that the interaction is turned on at time t = 0, and 
that prior to that the system and environment are not correlated ( correlation (0) = 0). This assumption is not very 
restrictive, since we can always nd a time prior to which the system and environment did not interact. Now however 
we make a stronger assumption. 
We will assume that the coupling between the system and the environment is weak, so that (t) S(t)E(t), for 
timescales over which perturbation theory remains valid. Furthermore, we will assume that the correlation time E 
(and thus the relaxation time) of the environment is suciently small that E(t) E(0) if t  E. 
Note that since we assume that the environment is in a thermal equilibrium, it has a thermal density matrix 
EnE 1E(0) = L e kBT |nE)(nE|,ZE n 
which is a stationary state, i.e., [ E(0), HE] = 0, so that E(0) has the same form in both the interaction picture and 
Schr odinger picture. Then 
t t11 J J 
S(t) = S(0)+ dt1 dt2 (TrE {[VI (t1), [VI (t2),S(t2)E(0)]]}). (il)2 0 0 
We can also go further and explicitly write the partial trace: 
(TrE {[VI (t1), [VI (t2),S(t2)E(0)]]})= L 
(Bk(t1)Bh(t2))[AI
k(t1), [AhI (t2),S(t2)]]

where (Bk(t1)Bh(t2))= Gk,h(t1,t2) is the correlation function for the environment.

This should properly be considered a dierence equation, since we have assumed that t  E. 
C. Assumption 2: Markov approximation 
We will also assume that we are working over timescales that are shorter than the gross timescale over which the 
system evolves, so that S(s)  S(t). Thus we can replace S(s) in the integral with S(t). We nally get the

8.2 Superoperators 
We want to describe the quantum evolution of systems in the most general case, when the system evolves non-
unitarily due to the presence of an environment24 . As we have seen, the states need to be described by density 
operators. Therefore, the evolution is to be represented by a map connecting the initial density matrix to the evolved 
one (t) = M[(0)]. The most general characteristics of this map will be determined by the fact that the properties 
of the density matrix should be in general maintained (such as unit trace). As the map M is an operator acting on 
operators, it is called a superoperator. 
Most generally, we can dene a quantum operator describing the time evolution law for density matrices as a map 
M :     with the following properties 
1. Linear 
2. Trace preserving 
3. Hermiticity preserving 
4. Positive 
4 (Completely positive) 
A. Linearity 
Although a non-linear map could also always map a density matrix to another density matrix, if we impose linearity we arrive at results that are more physical. Specically, the linearity property retains the ensemble interpretation of 
the density matrix. What we mean is the following. Suppose we can write a density operator as a linear superposition 
of two densities,  = a
1 + (1 a)2. The meaning of this expression is that with probability a we have a system 
described by 1 and with probability 1  a by 2. If the map describing the time evolution law is linear, this 
probabilistic interpretation is valid also for the evolved state. Assume now that the map is not linear, for example it 
depends on the trace of the density matrix: M() = eiATr{M }eiATr{M }, where M is an operator in the Hilbert 
space of  and A an Hermitian operator. We now consider a density operator 1 such that Tr{1M}= 0. We assume 
that we do not know exactly how we prepared the system, but with 50% probability is in 1. Assume then the density 
1matrix  = (1 +), such that Tr {M}= 0. Then, M() =  as the traces are zero. If we now instead consider 21the initial density matrix  = (1 + I) (that is, still a 50% probability of being in 1), where Tr{
MI} 
&gt; 0 we 2obtain an evolution for 1. That means, that in the two scenarios, the system behaves dierently, even if we had 
prepared it in the state 1 (remember the probabilistic interpretation), so that the evolution of a potential state of 
a system 1 depends on another potential state (  or I), even if this second state never occurred.

Consider a system S coupled to an environment E (the heat bath) such that 
H = H0 + V = HS + HE + V , 
and V describes the interaction between the system and the environment. Most generally it will take the form 
V = LAk  Bk(t), with A acting on the system and B on the environment (and we have even allowed for a k 
time-dependence of the random environment eld). In the Schr odinger picture, the time evolution of the density 
d(t)matrix is given by the Liouville equation, il = [H,(t)]. dt Dene the interaction picture density matrix

I (t) = I (0)+ dt1 [VI (t1),I (t1)] il 0

 Let us concentrate instead on the evolution of the (interaction picture) reduced density matrix 
S = TrE {I },
 
obtained by tracing over the environment. To obtain the average density operator, we also need to take an ensemble
 
average over the random uctuating environment:
 
t t t11 J 1 J J 
S(t) = S(0)+ dt1 (TrE {[VI (t1),I (0)]})+ dt1 dt2 (TrE {[VI (t1), [VI (t2),I (t2)]]}). il (il)2 0 0 0 
We want to nd an explicit expression for the system evolution only (in the form of a dierential equation). To do 
this, we will make a number of approximations. 
A. Simplication: Separability and energy shift 
We rst assume that at time t = 0 the system and environment are in a separable state: 
(0) = S(0)E(0). 
(this can always be obtained by choosing t = 0 appropriately).
 
This condition helps simplifying the second term in the LHS of the expression above. We have
 
TrE {[VI (t1),I (0)]}= L
[AI (t1),S(0)]TrE {Bk(t)E},

          <text>8.3 The Kraus Representation Theorem
 
We have seen in the preceding sections two dierent ways of describing the evolution of an open system.
 
The rst description started from the evolution of a composite system (including the system of interest and a bath)
 
and by tracing over arrived at a description of the open evolution via the operator sum.
 
The second description was instead quite abstract, and only dened the properties of the linear map describing the
 
evolution in order to arrive at an acceptable (physical) evolved state (that still possess the characteristics of a density
 
operator). The Kraus representation theorem reconciles these two description, by stating that they are equivalent.
 
 Theorem: Any operator   S() in a space of dimensions N2 that obeys the properties 1-3,4 (Linearity, TraceS 
preservation, Hermiticity preservation, complete positivity) can be written in the form: 
K K
S() = L 
MkM 
k , with L 
M 
k Mk =11 
k=1 k=1 
where K  N2 is the Kraus number (with NS the dimension of the system). As seen above, the Kraus representationS 
is not unique25 .
 
We consider three important examples of open quantum system evolution that can be described by the Kraus
 operators. To simplify the description we consider just a TLS that is coupled to a bath.
 
8.3.1 Amplitude-damping 
The amplitude-damping channel is a schematic model of the decay of an excited state of a (two-level) atom due 
to spontaneous emission of a photon. By detecting the emitted photon (observing the environment) we can get information about the initial preparation of the atom. 
We denote the atomic ground state by |0)
A and the excited state of interest by |1)A. The environment is the 
electromagnetic eld, assumed initially to be in its vacuum state |0)E . After we wait a while, there is a probability p 
that the excited state has decayed to the ground state and a photon has been emitted, so that the environment has 
made a transition from the state |0)E (no photon) to the state |1)E (one photon). This evolution is described 
by a unitary transformation that acts on atom and environment according to 
|0)S|0)E  |0)S |0)E 
 |1)S |0)E  
p|0)S |1)E 1p|1)S |0)E + 
(Of course, if the atom starts out in its ground state, and the environment is at zero temperature, then there is no 
transition.) 
By evaluating the partial trace over the environment, we nd the Kraus operators 
 
M0 = (0|USE |0)= ( 
1  0 ) 
, M 1 = (1|USE |0)= ( 
0 p ) 
01p 0 0 
The operator M1 induces a quantum jump, the decay from |1)A to |0)A, and M0 describes how the state evolves 
if no jump occurs. The density matrix evolves as 
 
0 + M1M
 ( 
00 1p01 ) ( 
p11 0 )
= +1p10 (1p)11 0 0 S() = M0M 
1 = 
 ( 
00 + p11 1p01 )
=  .1p10 (1p)11 
25 The proof can be found in Prof. Preskill online notes.

8.5.2 Stochastic Wavefunctions 
We now proceed to the next step of our program of understanding the behavior of one part of a bipartite quantum 
system. We have seen that a pure state of the bipartite system may behave like a mixed state when we observe subsystem A alone. What if we want to know the dynamics of A only? Can we describe its evolution even if we dont have full knowledge of B? (the bath) We assume that the state of the bipartite system undergoes unitary evolution: 
how do we describe the evolution of A alone? 
8.1 Combined evolution of system and bath 
We will rst start introducing the evolution of an open quantum system by considering it as a part of a larger(closed) 
system undergoing the usual unitary evolution. The total Hilbert space is thus H = HS  HB and we assume the 
initial state is represented by the separable density matrix  = S |0)(0|B 23. The evolution of the total system is 
then 
(t) = USB (S |0)(0|B )USB 
If we are only interested in the evolution of the system S we can at this point perform a partial trace on B 
 S (t) = TrB {(t)}= L 
(k|USB(S |0)(0|B )U|k) = L 
(k|USB|0)S (0)(0|U|k)SB SB 
k k 
where {|k)}is an orthonormal basis for HB . As the result of (k|USB |0)= TrB {|0)(k|USB }we obtain an operator 
Mk that acts only on the S Hilbert space. For example, in a matrix representation the elements of Mk are simply 
i,j i,j M= (i|Mk |j)(with|i), |j)dened on HS ); that is, we have M= Tr{|j, 0)(i, k|USB }= (i, k|USB |j, 0).k k 
Now we can write the evolution of the system only density matrix as 
L
S (t) = M(S (t)) = MkS (0)Mk 
k 
23 Here we only assume that the system B is in a pure state that we indicate as |0), we are not assuming that B is a TLS.

          <text>If we apply the channel n times in succession, the 11 matrix element decays as 11  11(1 p)n so if the 
probability of a transition in time interval t is  t, then the probability that the excited state persists for time t is 
(1 t)t/t  et, the expected exponential decay law. Also we have 12  12(1p)n/2  12e t/2. As t  , 
the decay probability approaches unity, so 
( 
00 + 11 0 )
S() = 0 0 
The atom always winds up in its ground state. This example shows that it is sometimes possible for a superoperator 
to take a mixed initial state to a pure state. 
In the case of the decay of an excited atomic state via photon emission, it may not be impractical to monitor the environment with a photon detector. The measurement of the environment prepares a pure state of the atom, and so in eect prevents the atom from decohering. Returning to the unitary representation of the amplitude-damping 
channel, we see that a coherent superposition of the atomic ground and excited states evolves as 
 (a|0)
S + b|1)S )|0)E  a|0)S + b 1p|1)S  
|0)E + p|0)A|1)E 
If we detect the photon (and so project out the state |1)E of the environment), then we have prepared the state |0)A 
of the atom. In fact, we have prepared a state in which we know with certainty that the initial atomic state was the 
excited state |1)A as the ground state could not have decayed. On the other hand, if we detect no photon, and our 
photon detector has perfect eciency, then we have projected out the state |0)E of the environment, and so have 
prepared the atomic state 
a|0)S + b 1p|1)S 
 |a|2 (or more precisely, if we normalize it: ( a|0)S + b 1p|1)S )/ 1pb2 ). Thenp(0) = |a|2  1p|b|2 &gt; |a|2 . 
The atomic state has evolved due to our failure to detect a photon, it has become more likely that the initial atomic state was the ground state! 
8.3.2 Phase-damping 
Phase damping describes a process where the system interacts with a large environment composed of many small 
subsystems. The interaction of the system with each of the environment subsystems is weak (compared to the system 
energy, but strong compared to the subsystem energy). Therefore the system is unchanged, while the environment subsystem is changed. Since there will be many of these interactions with the environment subsystem, their combined 
action does have an eect on the system, however it will not be enough to change its energy. 
An example is the interaction of a dust particle with photons. Collision of the particle with one photon is not going to change the particle state. However, if the particle was in the ground or excited state, the photon will acquire more or less energy in the collision, thus being excited to its rst or second excited state. We now formalize this model. 
When looking at the unitary evolution of this process, only the environment changes: 

 |0)S |0)E  1p|0)S |0)E + p|0)S |1)E = |0)S (1p|0)E + p|1)E ) 
  |1)S |0)E  1p|1)S |0)E + p|1)S |2)= |1)S (1p|0)E + p |2))E E 
Thus a possible unitary is    1p  p 0 0 0 0  
p 1p 0 0 0 0  0 0 1  0 0 0 
U =  0 0 0 1p 0 p  
0 0 0 0 1 0 
   
0 0 0 p 01p 
The Kraus operator are found by operating the partial trace of the operator above: 
  M0 = (0|U|0)=1p11 M1 = (1|U|0)= p|0)(0| M2 = (2|U|0)= p|1)(1|

          <text>Using this explicit expression and rearranging the terms we have

where we have dened an eective Hamiltonian 
kHe = Hi L 
L kLk2 k 
(notice that this is not a valid Hamiltonian in the usual sense, since it is not Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are not 
the energy, since they could be imaginary numbers). 
Expanding the density matrix in terms of an ensemble of pure states,  = L
j pj |j )(j |, we can rewrite the master 
equation in a suggestive form: 
  
d L 
)+L
pji(He |j )(j ||j )(j |H 
ekLk |j )(j |L 
k= dt j k 
Now we can interpret the rst two terms of this equation as a Schr odinger evolution for each of the pure states in 
the density matrix expansion: 
d |j )= iHe |j )dt 
while we interpret the last term as a quantum jump operator that changes |j )into |j,k)= Lk |j )with some 
probability. We can then have a probabilistic picture of the pure state evolution. After an innitesimal time, in the absence of 
jumps, the state will have evolved to 
|
j (t + t))= (1iHe)|j )/ 1pj , 
where we have introduced a normalization factor, which is needed since the Hamiltonian is not hermitian: 
L 
pj,k = t L 
k (j |L 
kLk |j ) pj = 
k k 
If instead a jump has occurred, the state would have evolved to 
 
kt |j,k)= Lk |j )pj,k 
Thus the evolution of the density matrix is given by 
  
(t + t) = L 
pj(1pj )|j (t + t))(j (t + t)|+ L 
pj,k |j,k )(j,k|
j k 
This expression leads us to the following interpretation: the system undergoes a dynamics that yields two possible 
outcomes: 
1. with probability 1  pj the system evolves to the state |j (t + t)), according to the operator He with an 
appropriate normalization 
2. with probability pj the system jumps to another state. There are many possible states the system can jump to, 
each one with a probability pj,k. 
This probabilistic picture is of course a coarse graining of the continuous time evolution. However, by discretizing 
time it becomes easier to devise a simulation procedure to reproduce the desired dynamics, with a wavefunction 
Montecarlo procedure.

Ap iptsystem and then Fourier transform. We will write Ak(t) = L

Ap ipt 
Aq iq 
S(t) = d Gkh()ke , he (t ),S(t). dt (il)2 0k,h p,q 
Here we used the fact that G(t, ) is stationary, and thus depend only on the dierence t , G(t, ) = G(t ). We 
then changed variables from   t . We can rewrite the equation as 
d i(p+q)t J  
iqS(t) = LL 
[Akp , [Aq ,S(t)]]e dGkh()e .hdt (il)2 0k,h p,q 
Thus we have the integral J  ei G() = J(), where the Fourier transform of the correlation function G() is the 0 the spectral function J(). With some simplications (due to statistical properties of the bath operators and to the 
fact that we only take terms resulting in an Hermitian operator), we nally arrive at the master equation: 
dS(t) Jk(pk , [Ap= LL

We can also write the master equation as the Redeld equation (subscripts indicate matrix elements):

8.5 Other description of open quantum system dynamics 
8.5.1 Stochastic Liouville equation and cumulants 
Stochastic Liouville theory is based on a semiclassical model of decoherence, in which the Hamiltonian at any instant 
in time consists of a deterministic and a stochastic part, which represents the eects of a random noise. In the 
simplest case of NMR T2 relaxation, this typically takes the form 
Htot(t) = Hdet(t)+Hst(t) = Hdet(t)+(t)HN ,
