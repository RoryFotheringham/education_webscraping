Engineering Economic Analysis: Slide 46 3.080 Econ &amp; Enviro Issues In Materials Selection 
Randolph Kirchain Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Department of Mater als Science &amp; Engineering Process Involves Four Steps 
1) Begin At The Current Endpoint (initially, the costs) 
How Can That Qu antity Be Broken Down? 
-- Initially,  How Many Do I Need x How Much Does Each Cost 
3) Analyze Required Information (i.e. parameters) 
-- Are Those Parameters Acceptable Endpoints? 
-- Can I (the model) Derive Them Fr om A Simpler Or More Relevant Set 
Of Information? 
4) If No, Repeat 1 With New Endpoints 
Watch Out For Interdependent Parameters

          <text>Goal &amp; Scope Definition: How far do we go? 
 Defining boundaries 
	No theoretical basis for exclusion 
	Often broken at environmental flows or economic flows of + 
value 
	Generally includes only processes in direct contact with product 
&amp; raw materials entering that product 
 Example: Oil Use 
	Combustion 
	If electricity, consider:
conversion efficiency &amp; transmission eff.
	Extraction 
	Transport 
	Refining

Inventory Analysis 
 Building a system model of the flows within your system 
	System boundaries and flow  types defined in Goal &amp; 
Scope 
	Typically includes only envi ronmentally relevant flows 
 Steps 
	Catalog what activities to include (draw a flowchart) 
	Data collection 
	Computation of flows per unit of analysis 
 Serious challenges around allocation

          <text>Create a one-variable data table  
You m ust design one-variable data tables3  so that input values are listed either down 
a colum n (colum n-oriented) or across a row (row -oriented). Form ulas2  used in a one-
variable data table m ust refer to an input cell4
1. Type the list of values you want to s ubstitute in the input cell either down one 
colum n or across one row.  
2. Do one of the following:  
 If the data table is co lumn-oriented, type the fo rmula in the row above 
the first valu e and one ce ll to the r ight of the column of values. Type any 
additional form ulas to the ri ght of the first form ula.  
 If the data table is row-oriented, t ype the f ormula in the co lumn to the 
left of the first value and one cell belo w the row of values. Type any additional 
formulas below the first for mula. 
3. Select the range of cells that contains the form ulas and values you want to 
substitute.  
4. On the Data  menu, click Table .  
5. Do one of the following:  
 If the data ta ble is column-orien ted, type the cell reference5 for the 
input cell in the Column input cell  box.  
 If the data table is row-oriented, type the cell reference for the input 
cell in the Row input cell box. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. formula: A sequence of values, cell references,  nam es, functions, or operators in a cel l that together 
produce  a new value. A formula always begins with an equal sign (=). 
 
3. data tab le: A ran ge of cells that shows th e results of substituting different values in one or more 
formulas. The re are t wo types of data tables: one-input tables and  
two-inp ut tables. 
 
4. input cell: Th e cell in wh ich each  inpu t value from a data tab le is su bstitu ted. Any cell on a work sheet 
can be the input cell. A lthough the inp ut cell do es not need to be part of the data tab le, the fo rmulas  in  data 
tables must refer to th e input cell. 
 
5. cell reference: The set of coordinates that a cell oc cupies on a works heet. For e xample, the reference  of 
the cell that a ppears  at the i ntersection of colu mn B an d row 3 is B3.</text>

          <text>About Dat a Tables 
Data tab les are part of a suite  of comm ands som etimes called what-if analysis1 tools. A 
data table is a range of cells that shows how changi ng certain values in your formul as2 
affects the r esults of  the formulas. Data tables p rovide a shor tcut f or calculating m ultiple 
versions in one operation and a way to view a nd com pare the results of all of the different 
variations together on your worksheet. 
One-variable data tables     For example, use a one-varia ble data table if you want to see 
how different interest rates affect a m onthly m ortgage payment. In the following 
exam ple, cell D2 contains the paym ent form ula, =PMT(B3/12,B4,-B5), which refers to 
the inpu t cell B3. 
Two-variable data tables     A two-variable data table can show how diff erent in terest 
rates and loa n term s will af fect the mortgage  payment. In the f ollowing ex ample, cell C2 
contains the paym ent for mula, =PMT(B3/12,B4,- B5), which uses two input cells, B3 and 
B4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. what-if analysis: A process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes affect the outcome 
of formulas on the worksheet. For exam ple, varying the interest rate that is used in an amortization table to 
determine the amount of the payments.  2. formula: A sequence of values, cell references, names, functions, or operators in a cell that together 
produce a new value. A formula always begins with an equal sign (=). 
 
  
 
  
 
  
Data table calculations Data tables recalculate whenever a worksheet is recalculated, 
even if they have not changed. To speed up calculation of a worksheet that contains a 
data table, you can change the Calculation  options to automatically recalculate the 
worksheet but not data tables.

SETAC Definition: 
The life cycle assessment is an objective 
process to evaluate the environmental burdens 
associated with a product, process, or activity by 
identifying and quantifying energy and materials usage and environmental releases, to assess the 
impact of those and to evaluate and implement 
opportunities to effect environmental 
improvements

Engineering Economic Analysis: Slide 46 3.080 Econ &amp; Enviro Issues In Materials Selection 
Randolph Kirchain Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Department of Mater als Science &amp; Engineering Process Involves Four Steps 
1) Begin At The Current Endpoint (initially, the costs) 
How Can That Qu antity Be Broken Down? 
-- Initially,  How Many Do I Need x How Much Does Each Cost 
3) Analyze Required Information (i.e. parameters) 
-- Are Those Parameters Acceptable Endpoints? 
-- Can I (the model) Derive Them Fr om A Simpler Or More Relevant Set 
Of Information? 
4) If No, Repeat 1 With New Endpoints

What is indirect cost? 
In economics, referred to as an  Externality 
 Great definition, explanation from wikipedia 
The decision-maker does not bear all of the costs or 
reap all of the gains from his action. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality 
What are examples of externalities?

 Facility has aging cooling syst em which currently runs 70% 
of the time the plant is open 
	Pump will only last 5 more years. As it deteriorates, 
the pump run time is expected to increase 7% per year 
 New cooling system would only run 50% of the time 
 Assumptions 
	Either pump uses 250 kWh, Electricity cost $0.05/KWh 
	Plant runs 250 days per year, 24 hours per day 
	Firms discount rate is 12% 
 What is the value of replacing the pump?

Distance to target 
 The further away current conditions are to an 
established target the more serious it is to worsen 
those conditions 
 Current CO2 per year vs. 1990 CO2 per year:0.0297 
 Current NOx vs. desired NOx: 0.941 
Current conditions are generally objective 
Desired target is subjective 
 How much bio-diversity loss is okay?

Numerous methods exist 
Generally, LC impact is calculated by multiplying 
inventory versus some impact assessment index 
LC Impact = (Inventory ) (Impact Index)

          <text>Issue 2: What Effects to Track?
 ISO establishes three broad categories of concern 
	Resource use 
	Human health 
	Ecological consequence 
	There is debate over whether to include damage to the 
man-made environment (e.g., acid rain damage to 
ancient structures) 
 What about aesthetics? Comfort? 
 Key issue: Double counting 
	Boundary between categories is fuzzy 
 Oil depletion vs. Emissions from oil use

Impact Assessment 
 Impact Category Definition 
	Identify what impacts are of  concern and which models 
will be used to translate inventory to impact 
 Classification: 
	Environmental stressors are correlated with specific impact categories 
 Characterization 
	Quantify amount of impact 
 Valuation 
	Possibly weighting impacts to rank or aggregate

Return on Capital 
 Why consider return on capital? 
	For most engineering projects, capi tal must be tied up for some 
period of time 
 Purchase a piece of equipment 
 Fund a research project 
	Revenues from the use of capital 
	Provides incentive to forego using the capital today for 
consumption 
 Provides incentive to take on risk of losing capital 
 Opportunity cost (of capital) 
	Profit available from the use of capital in some other alternative 
 Frequent engineering economy question: 
Does the return on capital exceed the opportunity cost?

          <text>What is Engineering Economy? 
 Engineering economy 
systematic evaluation of the economic merits of proposed solutions to engineering problems 
 Principles: 
	Develop the alternatives 
	Alternatives need to be identified and defined. 
	Focus on the difference 
	Only the differences in expected futu re outcomes among the alternatives
will effect the decision. 
	Use a consistent viewpoint 
	Prospective outcomes should be developed from a consistent, defined 
viewpoint. 
	Consider all relevant criteria 
	(try to) Use a common unit of measure 
	Make uncertainty explicit 
 Uncertainty is inevitable. Identify and explore it in analyses. 
	Revisit your decisions

 A new technology has been developed that speeds theassembly of vehicles. It has the following characteristics: 
 Current plant  30 stations , output = 200k per year 
 Profit = $1000 per vehicle 
 Investment - $300k per statio n, 30 stations per plant 
 Salvage value $60k per station 
 Maintenance cost - $20k / station / year 
 Improved throughput  1%

          <text>Effective Interest Rate
 By convention, most interest rates are quoted on an 
annual basis 
	e.g., 2% interest, with an interest period of 1 month 
 stated as 24% compounded monthly 
 How does this differ from 24% compounded annually? 
 F@1month = P(1.02) 
 F@2 months = P(1.02)(1.02) 
 F@12months = P(1.02)12 = 1.2682P 
 Effective interest rate = 26.82% 
 Effective interest rate ( ie) i = (1+ r )M  1r = nominal annual interest rate e
M = compounding periods per year M

IRR assumes that cash flows can be reinvested at 
the IRR over course of study 
 For projects with IRR &gt;&gt; MARR this may be 
unrealistic
Can have multiple IRR for cash flows, if net cash 
flows reverse signs more than once over study 
period
