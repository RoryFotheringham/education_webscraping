          <text>Examples of  
Non-Zero Sum Situations 
5 
 Parties have compatible interests (non-competitive similarities) 
 Want some of the same things (e.g., location of joint venture).  
 Usually relationship is a shared interest  
 
 Parties have different interests 
 Are differences obstacles to integration?   
 Differences in valuations (big office versus nice view)  
 Differences in expectations about future events allow 
contingency contracts 
 Most negotiations have multiple issues, differences allow 
trades

How to learn counterpartys interests?  
ASK WHY WHY WHY, AND LISTEN  
Resist fears of getting bogged down in their irrelevant stuff  
ASK DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS THAT PROBE WHERE 
VALUE IS FOR THEM (unlike RP questions less temptation to 
lie)    
RESEARCH  
PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES (COGNITIVELY 
IMAGINE WORLD FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE) 
 
How should you describe your interest?

          <text>MAXIMIZING OUTCOMES  
3 
To maximize your performance the best strategy may 
not be to compete/defeat the adversary   
We often compete by default 
Especially in games like situations (incl. arm wrestling &amp; 
negotiations), 
Especially when anxious  automaticity kicks in .    
What if youre the stronger party? Any advantage to 
cooperating in the power game?   
Did anyone try to signal to their partner their 
willingness to cooperate?  How?

          <text>USING INTERESTS TO CREATE OPTIONS  
11 
THINK CREATIVELY   
Slow Down!  Efficiency  Speed (again, beware 
default mode) 
Beware: splitting the difference temptation 
Ask: Given all interests, what solutions might 
benefit both?  How to expand pie?  
Brainstorm as many solutions as possible 
Try to identify different valuations/priorities, and 
how issues may be traded.

          <text>CONCESSIONS 
Do not offer more than one concession at a time 
Silence is ok 
Recall Cosby 
Declining magnitude of concessions is an unspoken 
signal to suggest closeness to RP without bluffing 
Use norm of reciprocity   label your concessions, 
be clear of cost to you, and wait.   
Contingent concessions?  May reduce risk but 
formalization may hurt trust

          <text>CONVERT BATNA TO RP 
Ask yourself:  Given all attributes of my BATNA, what 
outcome in this present negotiation would be 
BETTER than my BATNA?  
Conversion may require: 
 (i) quantifying subjective elements like 
preferences  (e.g., quality of life in different jobs, 
cities)   
(ii) assessments of probabilities (e.g, final terms 
of BATNA)

Study of experienced realtors:  Shown same house,

First offer sets the anchor  
 
Come prepared with a first offer (if you wait and see 
youll get anchored by other side!)

If I will sell X for $10 or more, and You will buy X for $12 or 
less, the ZOPA = space between $10 and $12 
   The ZOPA can be positive OR negative

Learn about the individual counterparty (including their 
experience negotiating cross-culturally)  
Anticipate possible cultural differences and consider 
these as one possible explanation of action of 
counterparty  (Avoid over-attributing behavior to 
culture)  
Expect process to require more time/effort to 
understand interests  
Pay attention to emotional dynamics: are you creating 
rapport or distrust?

          <text>Most common form of  
negotiations: Internal  
internal negotiations are not held with a party that is 
on the other side, but with one that is on your side.   
These are the people we interact with most often.  
Often we dont recognize these as negotiations and 
therefore do not act with conscious strategy

Sloanie Using LinkedIn 
 When interviewing recently (on campus), I found out 
the name of the interviewer. It turned out the 
interviewer and I had a shared relationship. I reached 
out to our mutual friend who provided me insight about 
their extra-curricular activities, their family status (he 
had just had a baby). During the interview I was able to 
use this  I picked examples from my experience that 
would generate empathy. At the end of the interview I 
mentioned that we had a shared friend, to further seal 
the connectivity with the interviewer. Success...!!</text>

In past 4 classes we introduced cognitive strategies for: 
 i) getting your piece of the pie,  
ii) expanding the pie, and  
iii) navigating the tensions and dilemmas when trying to 
do both.  
Going forward: COMPLEXITIES  
Emotions, relationships, trust, culture, multiple parties, 
cognitive biases, fairness, ethics

          <text>DEALING WITH DIFFICULT 
TACTICS  
HOW RESPOND?  Avoid:  reciprocating, surrendering or 
quitting.  Instead change the game.     
Strategy #1:  REFRAME by focusing on:  
Interests.  Respond as if they are attempting to communicate 
their interest, and ask further questions 
Option. Treat their position as one among many possible 
options of meeting your interests 
Standard. Treat their position as suggesting standard of 
legitimacy and ask why thats the right one to use (or propose 
an alternative) 
In each case be assertive in your push for a cooperative approach.

          <text>CORE CONCERN #1: 
APPRECIATION 
Obstacle #2 :  
failure to find some merit  or the underlying reasons for 
their view  
We only listen for whats wrong with others view 
Separate the need from the strategy for meeting it 
Appreciating DOES NOT EQUAL agreeing.  It 
acknowledges the reasons they see the world as they do.   
Even an ex- spouse who wants everything?   
Even a hostage taker?

          <text>EMOTIONAL OBSTACLES 
Even if both sides strategically understand the benefits 
of cooperation, they may not get there due to REAL 
(not tactical) emotions.   
Often you will walk in to a negotiation having made the 
strategic decision to seek an integrative solution but get 
derailed by your emotions or your counterpartys 
emotions.

          <text>THE SHAPIRO 
FRAMEWORK 
Emotions are too complex to deal with directly 
Overwhelming to analyze: what you are feeling? what 
they are feeling?  what do to about it?   
Focus on core concerns that typically matter to all 
negotiators.    
These all relate to how see self in relation to others 
Core concerns are the most common TRIGGERS of 
emotions, negative or positive, focus on these to avoid 
negative and stimulate positive emotions

          <text>HOW RESPOND TO  
REAL ANGER? 
If the anger is real try to listen and understand (more on 
this later) 
How can you tell if real or tactical?  
Tactical anger is used in early stages to unhinge, real anger 
is gradual and builds up (e.g., because one feels not listened 
to)  
Real anger subsides when you allow venting, listen and 
acknowledge where they are coming from  
Real anger escalates if you attempt a power-matching 
strategy  
Research the reputation of your counterparty  
Is the counterparty a lawyer?

          <text>DEALING WITH DIFFICULT 
TACTICS  
HOW RESPOND?  
--Strategy #2: NAME THEIR GAME AND ITS CONSEQUENCES 
AND SUGGEST ANOTHER:  
 You are essentially saying take it or leave it but I can play that 
game too and well spend all our time posturing.  But perhaps 
there is another approach to figuring out how to work out a deal 
that works for both of us.  
This shows that you are not nave or intimidated but are suggesting 
a different approach 
--Strategy #3: CHANGE THE PLAYERS/STRUCTURE 
--Strategy #4: PLAY THEIR GAME, BUT AS A DELIBERATE CHOICE 
--Strategy #5: WALK AWAY

          <text>HOW RESPOND TO 
ANGER? 
Common mistakes:   
Reciprocating.  This causes escalation &amp; often impasse  
Make concessions to appease the angry party 
Interpreting the anger to mean something about the other sides 
RP, and lowering your own AP 
Immediately abandoning integrative strategies  
   
 IF MUTUAL GAINS ARE POSSIBLE   DONT BE REACTIVE. 
PROACTIVELY SHIFT THE TONE TO COOPERATION  
 
Does it matter if the anger is tactical or real?

          <text>CORE CONCERN #1: 
APPRECIATION 
Obstacle #3 :  
failure to communicate the real merit or underlying 
reasons we see 
The love labs primary predictor : ratio of appreciation to 
critical remarks (need 5:1) replicated for organizations 
Not phony active listening with constant nods or 
employee appreciation day but truly appreciating  
Dilemma: Its hardest to appreciate when its most 
needed !

          <text>CORE CONCERN #1: 
APPRECIATION 
Understanding others concern AND acknowledging where its 
coming from  (NOT mean agree or being grateful)  
Obstacle #1:  
failure to understand (cognitively) others point of view.  This 
Requires truly listening to see the world from their 
perspective: 
Ask open ended questions  
Concentrate on their answer and not your response or next 
question 
Listen to tone as well as words  
Look at body language

          <text>HOW RESPOND TO 
TACTICAL ANGER? 
If the anger is tactical (not real) the counterparty is 
attempting to gain power through intimidation.  It is not 
effective to respond with empathy.  Instead, match their 
power first, then attempt to turn dynamics around .  
Indicate your capacity to be equally angry, to assert your 
rights, or to make an extreme opening demand 
Indicating capacity to reciprocate is different from 
reciprocating 
Suggest you prefer to refrain from a shouting match in favor 
of finding mutually beneficial solutions.  
We can continue shouting and blaming or we can move 
forward to finding a solution that meets our interests

          <text>The Dont Get Emotional Approach?  
Cant avoid feelings any more than thoughts   
Even if cognitively distract yourself - emotions will show up: 
 In your body  and behavior 
 Color your thoughts  (negative thoughts, less creative)  
EMOTIONS CAN BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE 
   NEGATIVE emotions: Obstacles to cooperation 
Divert attention from substance 
Damage relationship 
Make it hard to negotiate cooperatively 
BUT POSITIVE EMOTIONS (feeling in snyc ) Facilitate cooperation: 
--Share information 
--Reduce fear/suspicion

POINTS 
  when making tactical choices consider:  
 - how your moves may be read by other party (might it look 
different depending on cultural filter? E.g., status, gender) 
how might your moves may be countered?  how might your 
moves open/foreclose    options?  
Tactics should serve a strategy (otherwise 
hard to choose optimal tactic)   
Avoid acting/thinking incrementally 
(temptation to take it one step at a time)

          <text>EMAIL v. FACE:FACE 
Face to Face advantages?  
More trust and cooperation (particularly when interact for first time)  
Why? Richness of communication enhances rapport, which raises 
trust.  (we underestimate value of non-verbal: body language, 
facial expressions, tone, nodding, eye contact) 
Face:Face opens up critical informal time  (walking down hall, 
lunch, bathroom, is where the action is!)  
Misunderstandings, and no immediate correction mechanism  
Email leads to more risky interpersonal behavior unhinged from 
social conventions of politeness which build trust (flaming, 
threats, ultimatums, etc.)

          <text>AN ETHICAL FRAMEWORK 
Many of us use all 3 of these frameworks to make ethical 
decisions (we unconsciously flip from one framework to another depending on the context)  
The challenge: consciously construct an ethical framework 
consistent with your values that you can use to make decisions and, if necessary, explain your decisions to others.  
Good questions to ask yourself:  
how would this action affect your self image?  
how would you feel if your actions were revealed to a large number of people?   
What would be the result in society if everyone acted in this manner?

Social complexity  
Dynamics in groups are different from dyads (not just 
additive, people behave differently in groups).   
Beware: pressures of group think &amp; conformity to emerging consensus   

Studies show group effects on perception &amp; behavior  
Status differences can intensify this dynamic  
Stay conscious of this dynamic and remain in touch with

Always use caution in sharing information and wait for 
reciprocation.    
Revealing priorities among issues (i.e., rank ordering ) 
is a less risky disclosure than revealing preferences for 
specific alternatives within an issue.   
I care a lot about all 5 issues, they are all important,  
but if I had to say, issues 1 and 3 are more  important

BUT  
Cooperative strategies may leave you vulnerable to competitive exploitation

 I love apples, I cant eat oranges  
 You like apples and oranges equally well

retaliate,  
BUT also  forgiving - if they cooperate you reciprocate

Trust but Verify approach  cautiously cooperate making sure 
information flowing both ways 
(I value this over that, how about you?)  
Start with easier issues to build trust &amp; momentum, often these are 
compatible or integrative, bracket distributive issues 
(but ideally only reach tentative agreements to preserve logrolling)

          <text>CREATING INTEGRATION 
How get there?  4 steps: (i ) expand the issues  (ii) prioritize 
your issues, (iii) understand the others priorities, (iv) trade  
COMMON MISTAKES: 
Resolving issues one by one instead of simultaneously 
 Spending too much time negotiating over preferences 
within issues, and not enough on understanding relative 
valuations of different issues 
Looking for logical or thematic packages  
money bias

          <text>HOW TO MANAGE THE 
DILEMMA?  
Should you always compete and hope for maximal 
outcome?  
In indefinite round games typically get coop/coop or 
compete/compete cycles (no option for repeated 
individual maximal outcome) 
In integrative negotiations (unlike prisoners dilemma) 
both sides cooperating may lead to higher individual 
results than the compete/cooperate scenario because 
cooperating allows for more issues to surface and be 
traded

          <text>Tit-for-Tat 
Train the other party Another key element: 
Treat people as if they were what 
they ought to be, and you help 
them become what they are 
capable of being .

          <text>MANAGING THE DILEMMA 
Before the negotiations set a cooperative tone by 
signaling your desire to create value 
(lets find a solution that will max the benefits to both our 
sides) 
There are no fixed rules for how negotiations are 
conducted  implicit rules get set in opening moments.  
Initial tone drives dynamic for rest of negotiations  
Often useful to start with a discussion about the 
process  and co-creating process plan.

          <text>Key Strategic Questions 
Should you negotiate with employer?  (how weigh risks 
either way?)  
When in the process should you negotiate?  (what if 
employer pressures you to negotiate earlier?) 
What terms should you negotiate over?  
What should you ask for? 
What if they wont negotiate?

TWO POOR APPROACHES:  
1) Assume all issues are win-lose and ignore potential 
mutual gains  
 
2) Assume all issues are win-win and ignore potential 
exploitation

legitimacy? 
In small stakes negotiations transaction costs of 
principled agreement may exceed benefit (i.e., its 
faster just to haggle).  
What if you have more power?   
Ask yourself:  Is the excess amount over the legitimate 
standard amount worth costs to your: 
 (i) relationship? (ii) reputation? (iii) conscience?

          <text>THE RIGHT APPROACH? 
THERE IS NO ONE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE CONFLICT. Each 
mode is an approach, and a set of social skills, that may be 
optimal in a given context.    
WE ALL use all of these , but each of us uses some more than 
others (our default mode).  
Goal: Let the situation as opposed to habit drive your strategy .  Be 
conscious of the approach you are taking and strategically choose 
the appropriate approach for the circumstance.   
In important &amp; complex business negotiations the collaborative 
approach is typically optimal if both parties collaborate 
  What do you need to work on ?  Empathy?  Assertion? 
Engagement?
