Lecture 19-20Operational Level Findings
Significant improvements possible
reduced overtime
reduced missed trips
Single set of ranked report times can be used across all 
weekdays and seasons for each garage
separate ranked report times required for Saturdays, Sundays
Constant absence rates can be assumed
by hour of day
by day of week</text>

Fall 2006, Lecture 21Concessions
Concessions can be located in different 
areas:
directly outside the station area
in large intermodal stations as mixed-use
development
within station but outside paid area
at platform area
Station area concessions generally 
believed to deter crime by increasing 
level of activity
Within station is more controversial --
can contribute to violation of 
regulations (littering, eating and 
drinking on vehicles, etc.)</text>

influence:

1.Getting the drivers support is critical.
2.Full benefits from AVI/AVL/AVM

designing these applications

Fall 2006, Lecture 21Findings to Date:
 forecasting bus arrival time is feasible
 passengers place value on the information
 ridership gains have been modest
 cost-effectiveness of AVL systems for this 
purpose alone is highly uncertain
 not a substitute for good static information
Other analysis (Hickman 1993) suggests:
 modest benefits from real-time information 
on transit path choice for realistic networks
Real-time information is only one element of 
higher public transport service quality:
increasing ridership will require a much 
more comprehensive approach.Real-Time Passenger

Lecture 7, J. Attanucci12Conducting Performance Audits
Formal effort every 2-3 years
Usually facilitated by third party (state, regional 
agency, or consultants)
Often includes peer comparisons, but better if focus 
is on internal issues
Separate outside process provides opportunity to 
reflect, as opposed to react
Top management support critical
provides employee feedback
outside party often spurs further research
refines agency objectives</text>

Lecture 7, J. Attanucci13Peer Review vs. Internal Focus
Often outside requirements mandate measures and 
comparisons
Management must participate in peer selection (often 
cite density and development patterns as more 
important than size)
Peer comparisons best used to provide special focus, 
if appropriate</text>

Why Measure?
external requirem ent (funding, community support, e tc.)
internal use (improve internal management, input to policy, 
determine customer satisfaction, etc.)
"what gets measured gets attention"
Four points of view:
customer (quality of service)
community (impact on br oad community objectives)
agency (management effectiveness and efficiency)
driver/ve hicle (traffi c engineering measures)
(individual measures overlap th ese four points of view)

Assets are:
Renewed at critical midlife points

Replaced at the end of their useful lives
e.g.,  Buses 15 years

Lecture 4, F.P. Salvucci3) Results:  Short-term
a) Substantial success at getting Metro underway in less time than normal.  
System approximately 80% constructed, with cost overruns and schedule 
slippage at similar level as traditional procurement.
b) Great success at integrating operations perspective into the process.
c) Great difficulty managing interfaces, with claims-oriented contractor 
behavior and "extortionate" behavior by at least one major contractor 
creating delay to gain leverage over government.
d) Requirement for strong public oversight of construction process.
e) Rhetoric of privatization a consta nt problem with contractors seeking to 
evade clear requirements of contract.  
f) Substantial weakness in private sector capacity to integrate civil and 
system work.III-B Design-Build-Operate-Maintain Procurement of

Lecture 4, F.P. SalvucciIII. Lessons Learned Overall
A)Private contracting can be a successful strategy to turn 
around a bad situation expeditiously.
B)Transition problems are high, and requirements for 
honest, competent public sector management and 
oversight are very high.
C)No substitute for reliable public funding of investment 
and subsidy.
D)Support of labor unions key.
E)Complex interfaces among contractors very difficult to 
manage.
F)Multi-year management opportunity very useful.</text>

Lecture 4, F.P. Salvucci2) Approach (contd)
d) Demonstrate clear government capacity and willingness to invest 
in capital and pay operating and maintenance subsidy.  
e) Organize aggressive outreach and marketing of the business 
opportunity to private sector, internationally.
f) Use separate contractors for sp ecialized tunnel construction, and 
relatively small segments to en courage local participation in 
construction, with public sector responsible for integration of 
interfaces, with support of systems and operations contractor.  III-B Design-Build-Operate-Maintain Procurement of

3)Results, very short-term
a)Process of marketing the op portunity, preparing bidding 
documents, issuing request for pr oposals, evaluations, rejecting
unqualified bidders, fighting le gal challenges by unhappy bidders, 
to the point of award of contract s and mobilization took over two 
years, during which time the ol d organization became totally 
demoralized and service and maintenance degraded further.  
Successful bidders then claime d that condition of assets had 
deteriorated from the time of in itial inspection and bid, so they 
sought financia l relief. 
b)Service quality degraded further and ridership fell.</text>

a) Positive:  improved service, riders hip, stability of cost, multi-year 
manage ment
b) Crisis with Conrail proposed co st increase, resolution by changing 
contra ctor to B&amp;M, showed value of competition in avoiding 
extortionate costs.
4)Results:  Longer term
a) 1988-89 change in B&amp;M manageme nt philosophy, labor disputes, 
degradation of service. 
b) Re-bid with poor market res ponse
c) Amtrack contract:  better than ne w B&amp;M but less good than original.

5)Results, five years after transition
a)At least one of the four concess ionaires performing substantially 
poorly.  
b)Persistent non-cooperation with government on unified fare  
system, notwithstanding contractual requirements to cooperate.
c)Substantia l politic al lobbying by  concessionaires to change terms 
of contract. 
d)Quantity and quality of regulatory control staff eroded
e)Gover nment begins to not pay monthly subsidy.
f)Non-competitive "re-negotiatio n" of concessions to extend 
duration in exchange for added investment.

2)Approach
a)Break the system into 7 li nes to  be bid out as separate packages
b)Recog nize requirement to keep  track, vehicle mainten ance, an d 
operation in one unified contract. 
c)Public sector owns facilities, set s fares, schedules, reinvestment 
required.
d)Contractor keeps fare revenue to provide incentive
e)Ten-year concession dur ation

a) High-quality transit service with multi-year management 
philosophy providing better service than possible with traditional 
one-year public management model.
b) Reasonable cost, quality, and sch edule performance, comparable 
or superior to traditional method.
c) Need to develop stronger public sector oversight capacity for 
public transit.

Lecture 4, F.P. Salvucci2) Approach
a) Require one system provider and operator to take responsibility 
for vehicles, signals, power, track, yards, and shops, and 
operation and maintenance for ten years.
b) Retain public sector control of schedules and fares, and retention 
of fare revenue.
c) Allow private operator to receive 50% of fare revenue above initial 
prediction, to provide incentive but low risk.III-B Design-Build-Operate-Maintain Procurement of

Lecture 227Prospects for the Future
Key ingredients for private sector participation:
service is new and different
external intervention
incomplete assimilation of private operators
Direct transit authority operation is highly stable in North 
America:
small leverage for central government
at state/local levels of governmen t organized labor is a powerful 
force 
likely to resist change
confrontational/ideological nature of the debate</text>
