LECTURE NOTES: OCTOBER 1 9 
Defining the architect: Two examples of  ontological ar guments, Vitruvius and 
Gropius 
Vitruvius (ca. 70 BC - c. 15 BC) Vitruvius served the Roman army under Julius 
Caesar with the otherwise unknown Marc us Aurelius, Publius Mi nidius, and 
Gnaeus Co rnelius. Vitruvius is the author of De archit ectura, known today as The 
Ten Books on Architecture , a treatise written of Latin and Greek on architecture, 
dedicated to the emperor August us. 
Augustus (63 BC   AD 14), the first emperor of Roman  Empire 
Vitruvius, rebuilt Roman infrastructure  and added many temples. Vitruvius, 
who did not have any major commissions, wanted architectural production to be 
more systemitzed. 
Preface of De archit ectura outlines a theo-ontological  argument: Augustus unifies 
in his being that whic h was dispersed in society; he unifies, in particular, the 
difference between  mind and hand.  
Myth of Prometheus a nd the relationsh ip between the divine and the human 
The Architect having to work to unif y the disciplines whereas the divine 
Augustus does not.
The architect as a human reflection of  divine and thus as a special case 
intermediary between the realms, similar to an augur. 
Temple dis cussion: 
Augur [pri est] 
Conspicio (with sight) [viewing na tural signs sent by the divine] 
Contemplatio (with te mplate) [contemplatio n]

          <text>Robert Vischer German philosopher  (1847-1933) who invented the 
term Einfhlung  (esthetic sympathy, later translated in English as 
empathy). He differentiated between Sehen  and Schauen ., both which 
mean to see. Sehen , he argues, is to see passi vely. Schauen  is to gaze 
intently. It is a way  to grasp re ality. Form is a result of this 
intensific ation of the visual.  It is no t behind the real, but in front of it, 
between the real and the human. 
Rudolf Arnheim (July 15, 1904  June 9, 2007) was a German-born 
author, art and film theorist and perceptual psychologist. His major 
books are Art and Visual Per ception: A Ps ychology of the Creative Eye 
(1954), Visual Thinking  (1969), and The Power of the Center: A Study of 
Composition in the Visual Arts  (1982), but it is Art and Visual Perception 
for which  he was most wi dely known. Revised, enlarged and 
published as a New Version in 1974,  it has been translat ed into 14 
languages, and is very likely o ne of the most widely read and 
influenti al art books of the twentieth century. 
Form, for Arnheim, is not the abstract metaphysics of Plato. Nor is it 
the disciplinary painting for painters as agued by Clement 
Greenberg (1939). Form is the mediating real m of the human as a 
physical and socia l entity. It is linked with the creative principle as 
derived from Kant. Form is establis hed by great artists and architects. 
The rise of architectural psycholo gy took place n the 1950s. Lasted 
until the 1980s. Replaced by phenom enology (on the political right) 
and various strands of Frankfort Sch ool leftism, which  together came 
to be known as theory.

architecture mainstream after WWII, (1950s70s), phenome nology entered architectural main stream only durin g the mid 1970s. 
Whereas Psychology emphasizes the us, Phenomenology empha sis the integrity of the Self. It is antimetaphysical in a different way than 
Enlig htenme nt Reason in that it does not offer any binding agent of society. 
Edm und Huss erl (18591938) is seen as the foun der of phenomenol ogy. Individuals were expe cted to devel op a Life/World the prime characteristic 
of which was research but not in the conventional scientifi c sense, but in a person al sense. This research was to take place during the span of life

LECTURE NOTES: OCTOBER 1 3 
If Plato is the prim e exampl e of a metaphysical argum ent a nd Nietzsche the philosopher 
who tries to break us from the hold of m etaphys ics (i.e. our obligati on to the good and 
its pro ject of dem oting our hum anity), we have to f ill the g ap by return ing to the 
Enlightenm ent. Is a anti-m etaphysical archite cture possible?  If so, should it be resisted? 
The return to language of tradition, cultu re and vernacular are form s of such 
resistance. Should these in turn be resisted? 
LOCKE 
In opposition to the hierarchical m etaphysic s of Plato and Mediev al and Renaissance 
theology, Locke proposed a Law of Nature that, though divine in origin, was not 
metaphysically based, but outside the bounds of good and evil. The Law of Nature does 
not im pose the language of violence and rupture on society. It sort of is. 
For Locke, this m eans that we are co nstructe d from a tabula rasa and thus born free. As a 
result, once we understand this, we gravitate to ward the Social Contract creating social 
unities out of individuals. Contracts  not base d on W ho we a re, but W hat we can provide 
 is the new language of society. They m ust be binding and thus becom e a new type of 
law created from  WITHIN social co nversat ions. There is, unlike Plato, no explicit 
ideology of rupture, no violence  for the sake of the good. 
There is a historical line fr om: Locke - The W hig Party  English Colonial Mercantilism 
- US Constitution  Am erican W hig Party  Anti-Federalism  - Republican Party 
Nature rem ains an open-ended theo retical pro ject to th is day.

J.J. Rousseau added complexity to L ockes idea of Nature. Brought m etaphysics back 
into play. We are not born fr ee but in essence imprinted by the proto-politics of Fam ily. 
Only as adults are we technical ly free, but in truth do not want to be free as such. W e 
create associations by which we  reduce our freedom  for the sa ke of social participation. 
In that sense, the Social Cont ract is a type of invisible (metaphysical) extension of the 
(pre-m etaphysical) Fam ily. It is a new type of  Fam ily. Think here of something akin to a 
professional organization, based on obligations  and honesty. Exam ple is the Athenaeum .

The argum ent about social body that was such  a part of the Enlightenm ents project 
ends with a structure that beam s itself out in to the world at la rge in the f orms of laws, 
regulations, and codes; and fi nally punishm ent. It create s the new categories of the 
deviant, the crim inal, an d the dishon est. There has to be ways in which society 
structures that which es capes its s tructure. W hereas th e usu al argum ent based on the

LECTURE NOTES: OCTOBER 26 
Clement Greenberg, Avant-garde and Kitsch, 1939 
Modernity and the aes thetics of Modern Art are often linked thr ough the 
principle of  abstraction. But what is abstraction? 
Greenberg sees abstraction not as pure form in the traditional meta physical 
sense, but as a type of aesthetic medita tion on the art-of art-making: a poets 
poet, and artists art. The resul t may or ma y not look abstract. He calls it the 
imitating of imitating, the avant-garde s specializatio n of itself. Ultimately, 
because of the domina nce of kitsch, th e avant-garde is not the NE W but the 
preservation of whatever living cultur e we have right now. This means that 
the purpose of the avant-garde is not necessarily to be avant-garde in the 
political se nse. 
Greenbergs article presents a historical legitimation of abstraction as well as a 
theoretical one 
1.	society is in a state of decay in wh ich artists and audience no longe r 
communic ate. 
2.	In the la te 19th centur y, Bohemia nism cut the ties with society. 
3.	But this freedom  though it cons tituted a type of purification - could only 
be temporary. 
4.	A small group of artists emerged  who talke d in essence to each other. 
They were their own  audience. [thus the creation of what we might call 
difficult ar t.] They im itate not God but the d isciplines and processes 
of art itself. 
5.	A privileged group of elite clients  eventually arose who nurtured these 
artists by a thread of gold. 
6.	Unfortunately while this was all taki ng place, society saw the rise of 
individualism, Realism, and peasant urban aesthetics leading to kitsch  
born in the city - and the indu strialization of bad taste. 
Clement Greenberg  (January 16, 1909   May 7, 1994) was an influential 
American a rt critic closely associated with  Modern art in the United States. Such 
was Green berg's influence as an art critic that Tom Wolfe in his 1975 book The</text>
