Anomalous scattering causes smal l but measurable differences in 
intens ity between the reflections hkl and -h-k-l not normally present. That 
means  for non-centrosymmetric crystal s in the presence of atoms heavier 
than sulfur, Friedels law is not strictly true.
Under conditions of anomalous scattering, 
electrons are perturbed from their 
centrosymmetric distributions; electrons 
are jumping between orbitals.
e-The breakdow n of centrosymmetry in the 
scattering atoms is reflected in a loss of 
centrosymmetry in the pattern of scattered 
X-ray intensities.
Thus I(hkl) = I(-h-k-l)is no longer true.

          <text>A crystal is a three dimensional 
periodic discontinuum. It consis ts 
of identical b ricks called unit 
cells, which form  a three-
dimensional lattice.
The unit cell is defined by the 
axes a, b, and c, and the three 
angles , , , which form a right-
handed system.

          <text>Atomic Coordinates
The coordinates of the atoms with in a unit cell are given as 0  x&lt; 1,  
0 y&lt; 1  und  0 z&lt; 1. Thus distance between two atoms x1y1z1and 
x2y2z2is:
d = (x2-x1)a+ (y2-y1)b+(z2-z1)coder d= ax+ by+ cz
The x, y, and zcoordinates are also used to describe symmetry 
operations:
If there is an atom on the place x, y, z
x+1,y,z is the equivalent atom in the next unit cell in x-direction ( acell 
axis).
-x,-y,-z is generated by an in version center at 0,0,0.</text>

Symmetry Operation: An operation that leads to superimposition of an 
object on itself.
Symmetry Element: An imaginary geometric entity (line, point, plane) about 
which a symmetry operation takes place.
Unit cell: The smallest unit that can generate the entire crystal structure only 
by means of translation in three dimensions.
Asymmetric unit: The minimum unit from which the structure can be 
generated by symmetry operations.
Lattice: A rule of translation.</text>

          <text>The Unit Cell
The unit cell is the smallest unit th at can generate the entire crystal 
structure only by means of tr anslation in three dimensions.
Within each unit cell there may be se veral symmetry related copies of 
the asymmetric unit but in general  those are oriented differently.
Even though in the structure of 
NaCl there is an atom at every 
corner of the unit cell, such an 
arrangement is rather rare.
If the structure is centro-
symmetric, the unit cell is 
chosen so that its origin lies on 
an inv ersion center. 
Else: conformity with other 
symmetry elements (see 
Volume A International Tables 
for Crystallograpy ).

Every atom in the unit cell contributes  to every reflection according to 
its chemical nature and its relative position. Owing to this shift in 
position relative to the other at oms, the photons contributed by each 
atom in the unit cell have a phase shi ft relativ e to those from other

          <text>Space Group Determination
The first step in the determination of a crystal structure is the determination 
of the unit cell from the diffraction pattern.
Second step: Space group determination.
From the symmetry of the diffraction pattern, we can determine the Laue
group, which narrows down the choic e quite considerably. Usually the Laue
group and the metric symmetry of the unit cell match.
The &lt;| E2-1 |&gt; statistics, can give us an i dea, whether the space group is 
centrosymmetric or acentric. Even thought  the diffraction pattern is alway s 
centrosymmetric, the intensity distribut ion across the reciprocal space is 
much more even for a centrosymmetric space group.
From systematic absences, we can det ermine the lattice type as well as 
screw axes and glide planes.
This is usually enough to narrow down  the choice to a very short list.</text>

          <text>Intensities of the Reflections
With the help of Braggs law and the Ewald construction, we can 
calculate the place of a reflection  on the detector, provided we know 
the unit cell dimens ions. Indeed, the position of a spot is determined 
alone by the metric symmetry of the unit cell. The intens ity of a spot, 
howev er, depends on the contents of the unit cell (and, of course, on 
expos ure time, crystal size, etc.). 
Reflec tions are weakened by the r adius of the atoms (atomic form
factor) and the thermal motion of t he atoms (temperature factor U). 
Both these effects are stronger at high resolution.

Lattice centering and symmetry elements  with translation (glide planes and 
screw axes) cause certain reflections to have zero intensity in the diffraction 
pattern. If, e.g., allreflections 0, k, 0with odd values  for kare absent, we 
know that we have a 21axis along b.

have a cglide plane perpendicular to b.

          <text>Symmetry in Reciprocal Space
The diffraction pattern is always centrosymmetric (at least in good 
approx imation). Friedels law: Ihkl= I-h-k-l.
Fourfold symmetry in the diffraction patte rn corresponds to a fourfold axis in 
the space group ( 4, 4, 41, 42or 43), threefold to a threefold, etc.
If you take away the translational part of the space group symmetry and add 
an inv ersion center, you end up with the Laue group. The Laue group 
describes the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. The Laue symmetry can 
be lower than the metric symmetry of the unit cell, but never higher.
That means : A monoc linic crystal with = 90 is still monoclinic. The 
diffraction pattern from such a crys tal will have monoclinic symmetry, even 
though the metric symmetry of th e unit cell looks orthorhombic.
There are 11 Laue groups :

          <text>Symmetry in Reciprocal Space
Before we can talk about how to so lve the phase problem, we need to talk 
about symmetry in reciprocal space.
Symmetry in the crystal (real space) influences the symmetry in reciproc al 
space. A twofold in real space causes  a twofold in reciproc al space, a 
mirror, causes a mirror, a fourfold a fourfold, etc. 
The reciproc al space, however, is always centrosymmetric, and translational 
symmetry has no effect on the symmetry in reciproc al space. That means a 
P2, P21, P2/m, P21/m, P21/c, etc.all correspond to the same symmetry 
group in reciprocal space. 
The symmetry group in reciproc al space is called Laue group. There are 
eleven of them.</text>

          <text>Direct Methods
Direct methods determine the phases di rectly from the diffraction pattern 
without any knowledge about the nature of the sample. 
Several statistical equations relate t he phase of a reflection to its intensity 
and the intensity and phase of other refl ections in the dataset. This can be 
done with a certain probability. Many probability relations together with 
fast computers make it possible to determine the phases of many 
measured reflections with some accuracy.
Direct methods usually do not us e structure factors but operate in E-space 
(remember the normalized structure factors from the E2-1 statistics?). The 
advantage is, that the intensity of a normalized structure factor does not 
decline with the resolution; and dire ct methods assume atoms to be point-
scatterers anyway.
Direct methods are used predominant ly as black-box methods and we 
dont really have the ti me to change that here.</text>

          <text>The Patterson Function
We measure intensities I. After apply ing several corrections, they translate 
into squared structure factors also k nown as structure factor amplitudes F2.

IF2F: structure factors
The Fourier transform of the structure factors (with phases) is the electron 
dens ity function. The Fourier transform of  the structure factor amplitudes (as 
measure, without the phases) is the Pa tterson function. The unit cell of the 
Patterson map is the same as that of the crystal structure.
The Patterson function has some very interesting features:
It consists of peaks, that have coordinates ( u, v, w) and an intensity
The distance of each peak from the orig in corresponds to an interatomic 
distance in real space.
The height of the peaks is propor tional the involved electrons and 
proportional the multiplic ity of the co rresponding vector in real space.
These features make it possible to  use the Patterson map to solv e the 
phase problem</text>

          <text>Symmetry of the Patterson Function
For every vector i j  there is always a vector ji. Thus the Patterson is 
always  centrosymmetric.
In general, the symmetry of the Patters on is determined by  the symmetry of 
the diffraction pattern (also centrosy mmetric). Glide planes and screw axes o f 
the space groups correspond to mirror planes and normal rotation axes in 
reciprocal space. The Patterson has the same symmery as the Laue group.</text>

          <text>Space Group Determination
The first step in the determination of a crystal structure is the determination 
of the unit cell from the diffraction pattern.
Second step: Space group determination.
From the symmetry of the diffraction pattern, we can determine the Laue
group, which narrows down the choic e quite considerably. Usually the Laue
group and the metric symmetry of the unit cell match.
The &lt;| E2-1 |&gt; statistics, can give us an i dea, whether the space group is 
centrosymmetric or acentric. Even thought  the diffraction pattern is alway s 
centrosymmetric, the intensity distribut ion across the reciprocal space is 
much more even for a centrosymmetric space group.
From systematic absences, we can det ermine the lattice type as well as 
screw axes and glide planes.
This is usually enough to narrow down  the choice to a very short list.</text>

          <text>The Patterson Function
That means , a peak u,v,win the Patterson map indic ates that atoms exist in 
the unit cell at x1,y1,z1and x2,y2,z2such tha t
u= x1x2
v= y1y2
w= z1z2
Thus, for Natoms in a unit cell, the Patterson map will contain Npeaks. 
Nout of these N2peaks will be of zero length fr om each atom to itself. All 
these zero vectors will fall on t op of one another in the origin of the 
Patterson map, which generates a very high zero-peak. 
Taking this into account, the Patterson map contains N2 N + 1theoretically 
distinguis hable peaks.
In real life many of those peaks, whic h are relatively  broad, will overlap and 
be, in fact, not distinguishable fr om some neighbor peaks. Us ually, the 
strongest peaks, corresponding to vect ors between heavy atoms, are well 
resolv ed and usable.2</text>

          <text>Problems of the Patterson Method
Frequently localizing a single heavy atom  in a structure is enough to find all 
other atoms by means of iterative di fference Fourier syntesis with amplitudes
|FoFc| and phasesc.
Problems arise in non-centrosymmetr ic space groups  when the heavy atom 
substructure is centrosymmetric ( e.g.only one heavy atom). In this case, all 
c-values derived from the heavy atom positions are 0or180 and the 
calculated electron dens ity is centrosymmetric, i.e.it shows a double-immage. 
Another problem is the atom-type as sgnement: Electron dens ity and Patterson 
peak heights are proportionel to atom ic number, however only roughly and 
isoelectroic species are notoriously diffic ult to distinguis h. This is  problem 
also with diret methods and someti mes even during structure refinement.</text>

          <text>Systematic Absences
Lattice centering and symmetry elements  with translation (glide planes and 
screw axes) cause certain reflections to have zero intensity in the diffraction 
pattern. If, e.g., allreflections 0, k, 0with odd values  for kare absent, we 
know that we have a 21axis along b.
Other example: if all reflections h, 0, lwith odd values  for lare absent, we 
have a cglide plane perpendicular to b.

          <text>One Heavy Atom in  P-1
For every atom at x, y, zthere is a symmetry equivalen atom at x, y, zand
hence a Patterson peak at 2x, 2y, 2z. 
The compound C32H24AuF5P2crystallizes in P-1 with two molecules per unit 
cell (that makes one per asymmetric unit). The two gold atoms are related by 
the inversion center. Besides the peak on  the origin (height 999) there is a 
peak with height 374 atu= 0.318 = 2x,v= 0.471 = 2y,w= 0.532 = 2z,which is 
much higher than all the other peaks (145). Its height is consistent with the 
calculated value for a Au-Au vecort (377).
To calculate the positions  x, y, zof the gold atom in the unit cell, we can divide 
each of the Patterson coordinates by 2.  However, we also need to take into 
account the fact that there is always a peak at u+1, v+1and w+1
(corresponding to next unit ce ll in the crystal)! Thus:
x= 0.318/2 = 0.159 or1.318/2 = 0.659
y= 0.471/2 = 0.236 or1.471/2 = 0.736
z= 0.532/2 = 0.266 or1.532/2 = 0.766
Those eight truley equivalent solutions  correspond to the eight possible 
positions of the inv ersion c enter in the space grup P-1.</text>

          <text>Symmetry in Reciprocal Space
The diffraction pattern is always centrosymmetric (at least in good 
approx imation). Friedels law: Ihkl= I-h-k-l.
Fourfold symmetry in the diffraction patte rn corresponds to a fourfold axis in 
the space group ( 4, 4, 41, 42or 43), threefold to a threefold, etc.
If you take away the translational part of the space group symmetry and add 
an inv ersion center, you end up with the Laue group. The Laue group 
describes the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. The Laue symmetry can 
be lower than the metric symmetry of the unit cell, but never higher.
That means : A monoc linic crystal with = 90 is still monoclinic. The 
diffraction pattern from such a crys tal will have monoclinic symmetry, even 
though the metric symmetry of th e unit cell looks orthorhombic.
There are 11 Laue groups : 
-1,   2/m,   mmm,   4/m,   4/mmm,   -3,   -3/m,   6/m,   6/mmm,   m3,   m3m</text>

The maximum resolution dcan be calculated from the Bragg equation:

This dcorresponds approx imately to the distance 
between two atoms (or more generally points in 
space), whic h can still be resolved from one 
another in an electron dens ity map calculated from 
data at that particular resolution.
For centrosymmetric structures one would expect 
ca. 80 /d3independent reflections per non-hydrogen 
atom. For non-centrosymmetric structures only half 
that number (assuming Friedels law is true). That 
means , for a protein structure at 1.5  resolution 
we have ca. 12 reflections per atom. At 2.5  only 
ca. 2.6 reflections per atom. There are many 
protein structures at 3  (1.5 spots per atom) and

In a first approximation the atomic  scattering factor is dependent on 
the atom number (number of electrons). With increasing resolution 
(that is decreasing Bragg plane distance, equiv alent to higher 
scattering angles 2) the scattering factor becomes smaller.

          <text>Atomic Form Factors
X-rays are scattered by the electr ons of an atom, hence the point 
atom approximation does not hold too well. Ergo: Bragg planes are 
not mathematical planes but have a fuzzy thickness, which means 
there is a path difference occurring within each individual Bragg plane.
Displacement of the place of diffraction from the ideal pos ition of 
leads to a path difference of 2/d. This has a weakening effect on 
the intens ity of the corresponding reflec tion. This effect is a function of 
the distance dbetween the Bragg planes: it becomes stronger with 
smaller dista nces ( i.e.at higher resolution).

          <text>Intensities of the Reflections
With the help of Braggs law and the Ewald construction, we can 
calculate the place of a reflection  on the detector, provided we know 
the unit cell dimens ions. Indeed, the position of a spot is determined 
alone by the metric symmetry of the unit cell. The intens ity of a spot, 
howev er, depends on the contents of the unit cell (and, of course, on 
expos ure time, crystal size, etc.). 
The intens ity of a reflection depends, among other things, on the 
population of the corresponding set of Bragg planes with atoms. If 
there are many atoms on a plane,  the corresponding reflection is
strong, if the plane is empty, the reflection is weak or absent.
Other factors are the thermal mo tion of the atoms and the atomic
radius.</text>

Sets of planes in real space (with spacing d) correspond to points in reciprocal 
space (distance d*from the origin). The vector d*is perpendicular to the Bragg 
planes and has the length |d*| = 2sin/.
A reflection is visible when the corresponding set of Bragg planes is in reflex

Frequency Advisory Committee (1958-60).
Inspired by the work of M. von Laue, Lawrence Bragg, a grad student then, came 
up with                       . Usi ng the first diffractometer, built by W. H. Bragg to

In order to prove that X-rays were actually electromagnetic
waves, he wanted to produce some kind of interference. His then more famous 
colleagues Sommerfeld and Wien thought it  would never work, but Walter 
Friedrich (one of Sommerfelds assistants) and Paul Knipping tried it (with 
CuSO4) and succeeded after a while.
Laue worked out the mathematics and the whole thing was published in 1912.

1895, while experimenting with electric cu rrent in an evacuated glass tube, he 
saw fluorescence of barium platinocyanide and figured that rays of some kind 
must be traveling across the room.
More experiments followed. X-rays go through paper, wood, aluminum, they 
blacken photo plates and do not show properties of light like reflection or 
refraction. X-ray photographs of his wifes hand.

          <text>Symmetry
A body is said to be symmetrical when it can be divided into parts 
that are related to each other in certain ways. The operation of
transferring one part to the position of a symmetrically related part is 
termed a symmetry operation , the result of which is to leave the final 
state of the body indistinguis hable from its original state. In general, 
successive applic ation of the symmetry operation must ultimately
bring the body actually into its original state again.

In a two-dimens ional desi gn, such as that of a wall-paper, a unit of 
pattern is repeated at regular intervals. Let us chose some 
representative point in the unit of  pattern, and mark the position of 
similar points in all the other units. If these points be considered 
alone, the pattern being for the mo ment disregarded, it will be seen 
that they form a regular network. By drawing lines through them, the 
area can be div ided into a series of cells each of whic h contains a 
unit of the pattern. It  is immate rial whic h point of the des ign is 
chosen as representa tive, for a similar n etwork o f points will always 
be obtained.

The metric symmetry is the symmetr y of the crystal lattice without 
taking into account the arrangement  of the atoms in the unit cell. 
In reciprocal space, this is  equiv alent to look ing at the positions of 
the reflections without taking into account their relative intensities .
There are 7 so called crystal systems (triclinic, monoc linic, 
orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic). The 
rhombohedral system can be underst ood as a special case of the 
trigonal system, but some crystal lographer count it as a separate 
crystal syste m.
Taking into account possible latti ce centerings, there are 14 so 
called Bravais lattices .</text>

In three dimensions  we have additi onal symmetry operators: inversion 
centers and screw axes. In addition , the mirror becomes a mirror
plane, and the glides become glide planes.
The inversion center can be understood as the intersection of a mirror 
and a twofold axis.
Screw axes are like spiral staircases. The rotation is combined with a 
translation in a defined crystallograph ic direction by a defined step 
(half a unit cell for twofold scre w axes, a third of a unit cell for 
threefold screw axes, etc.</text>

It is reasonable to assume that at oms move anisotropically, i.e. with

as a sphere, it is described as an e llipsoid; the elements of the matrix 
describing the ellipsoid are called anis otropic displacement parameters

          <text>Evalution of the Model
The model should only be altered if a change improves its quality. 
How to judge quality of the model?
Least-squares approach: 
By means of Fourier transformation, a complete set of structure factors 
is calculated from the atomic model.  The calculated intensities are then 
compared with the measured intens ities, and the best model is that, 
which giv es the smallest value for the minimization function M.

An atom on a twofold axis along b. 
A 180 rotation must not change the 
position of the atom or the shape of 
the thermal ellipsoid. 
From the first condition follows: 
(x, y, z) = (-x, y, -z), which is only true 
for x= z= 0. 
The second condition dictates: 
(U11, U22, U33, U23, U13, U12) = 
(U11, U22, U33, -U23, U13, -U12), which is 
only true for U23= U12= 0.

          <text>Restraints
Restraints are assumptions used to  introduce chemical or physic al 
information into a refinement as additional experimental observations. 
Restraints are treated as data (with a standard uncertainty).

Restraints should be used with great care and only if justified. When 
appropriate, howev er, they should be used without hesitation, and 
having more restraints than parameter s in a refinement is nothing to be 
ashamed of.</text>

          <text>Geometrical Restraints
One can restrain a group of atoms to lie on a common plane (e.g. a pheny l 
ring) or an interatomic distance or a bond angle to a certain target value 
(direct distance restraints). 
Alternatively , one can restrain equiv alent distances to be equal (relative
distance restraints, aka similarity restraints).
Advantage of relative distance restraints: No need for outside information, 
refinement converges well ( esp. for Z&gt;1). 
Disadvantage: underestimated standard uncertainties of bond lengths and 
angles. And it is too easy to refine a structure in a space group with too low 
symmetry.</text>

Close examination of the Fo-Fcmap helps to introduce new atoms and

Once all non-hydrogen atoms are found, the atoms can be refined

Once the model is anisotropic, the hydrogen atom positions can be 
determined or calculated.</text>

          <text>ADP Restraints
It is fair to assume that atoms bound to  one another move similarly, both in 
direction and amount. 
One can restrain the anis otropic displacement parameters of two atoms in 
the direction of the bond between them to be equal  within a given standard 
uncertainty (e.g. 0.01). This is  called a rigid bond restraint.
It can be assumed that atoms that  are bound to one another move in 
similar directions with approximately similar amplitudes. Therefore, one 
can restrain atoms close to  one another to have the same Uijcomponents 
within a given standard uncertainty (e .g. 0.04). This is called a similar-
ADP restraint.
The second assumption is much bolder  then the first one, hence the much 
larger standard uncertainty.</text>

The size of t he ellipsoids (or spheres  in the isotropic case) is chosen so 
that the ellipsoid includes  50% elec tron density of the atom type in the 
model. In the example below eac h ellipsoid or sphere includes 3 
electrons. Thus, abnormally large or  small ellips oids can point out

Fe        D5h or                         Fe        D5d
The first X-ray structure analysis  (in 1956 at room temperature) showed Z= 2 
in P21/c. Thus, the molec ule must sit on an inversion center. Therefore it also 
must be staggered ( D5d).Electron scattering in the gas phase (1968) showed 
approx imate D5hgeometry.
The high-temperature X-ray data can be understood 
as disorder of a D5hstructure, as the ADPs of the 
carbon atoms remain large even at somewhat lower 
temperature (173 K, 1979).
Two more low-temperature structures have been determined later: A triclinic 
phase at 164K was found to be almost D5h(deviation ca. 9) and an 
orthorhombic phase at 98 K was  exactly D5hwithin the experimental error.Figure courtesy of George M. Sheldrick.

          <text>Hydrogen Atoms
Espec ially for hydrogen atoms bound to  carbon it is frequently possible to 
calculate the hydrogen positions  from  the coordinates of the atoms the 
hydrogen atoms are attached to, as  the standard bond lengths and angles 
are well known. 
Hydrogen atoms of water molec ules must be detected in the experimental 
electron density or else they c annot be included into the model.
Even more difficult to detect c an be hydrogen atoms in heavy metal 
hydrides. The sometimes relatively st rong Fourier truncation ripples close 
to heavy atom positions can overpowe r the rather weak electron dens ity 
maxima representing the hydrogen at oms. Very accurate and espec ially 
complete high quality data and proper sca ling are required to distinguish 
those hydrogen atoms from  the background nois e.</text>

As mentioned earlier, after anisotropi c refinement, atoms are represented 
by 50% probability ellips oids. Abnormally large or small ellips oids, as well 
as ellipsoids  with strange shapes, tell us something about problems with 
the refinement.
Two or more pos itions of a disorder ed atom can be represented by a large 
displacement ellips oid. E.g.A disordered ethyl group:</text>

          <text>Hydrogen Atoms
In most cases, the pos itioning of hydrogen atoms bound to carbon in an 
atomic model during the refinement of an X-ray crystal structure is done 
entirely without any or only very little direct information from the diffraction 
experiment. Hy drogen atoms on aromatic carbons, CH, CH2groups, most 
CH3groups are easy. CH3in acetonitrile, Cp* or toluene: torsion angle

For every structure: overall scale factor osf.
Poss ibly additional scale factors, maybe a Flack-x -parameter. 
Atom types are also parameters, even thought they are not refined. 
Incorrectly assigned atom types can cause quite some trouble.
Altogether: The number of parameter s is roughly ten times the number

          <text>Hydrogen Atoms
It is electron dens ity that we measur e by X-ray diffraction. The heav ier an 
atom is and the more electrons it has , the stronger is its effect on the 
diffraction pattern. This als o means that, especially in the presence of 
heavy atoms, light atoms are somewhat  more difficult to localiz e. The 
lightest atom of all is hydrogen: it has only one electron, localized away 
from the nucleus. Therefore, hydrogen atoms are notoriously difficult to 
detect with X-ray diffraction methods.
Relatively high electron density betw een the atoms and libration effects 
make XH bonds appear too short.

          <text>Problems and Pitfalls: Wrong Space Group
At leas t 1% of the crystal struct ures are publis hed in the wrong space 
group. Frequently, symmetry elements (esp. inversion centers) have been 
overlooked.
When an inv ersion center is overlo oked, the consequences can be very 
serious.  The refinement is mathemat ically unstable (saddl e point instead of 
minimum). Bond lengths that shou ld be equal fly apart (e.g. 1.52  1.38 
+ 1.66 ) and the same happens to th e displacement parameters of atoms 
related by the center. 
It is not so bad when other symmetr y elements are overlooked. The 
refinement is stable but too many par ameters are refined against too many 
data. The structure is not distorted, but  is less precise than if the data had 
been averaged in the correct Laue group and fewer parameters used to 
describe it.</text>

          <text>Constraints
Constraints are mathematical equatio ns, rigidly relating two or  more 
parameters or assigning fixed numerical  values to certain parameters, 
hence reducing the number of ind ependent parameters to be refined.
Site occupation factors are constraint s present in every structure. Even 
for disordered atoms the sum of t he occupancies is constrained to add 
up to 1.0.
Hydrogen atoms can be placed on mat hematically  calculated positions 
and refined using a riding model.
That means  X-H distances and H-X-H or H-X-Y angles are constraint to 
certain values. Not the hydrogen positions !
Atoms on special position require constraints for their coordinates, 
occupanc ies and sometimes also their ADPs:</text>

refined as carbon, even though t here are three oxygen atoms and one 
nitrogen atom in the molecule. As ca rbon has 6 electrons, all ellipsoids are 
calculated to contain 3 electrons fr om the calculated electron density. 
Nitrogen and oxygen have more electron s than carbon, making the electron 
dens ity higher at oxygen and nitrogen site s than at places  where we have a 
carbon atom . That leads to a smalle r volume of the corresponding ellipsoid, 
as 3 electrons are only 43% of a nitrogen and only 38% of an oxygen. The ADPs can help with 
the assignment of atom 
types: 
Each thermal ellipsoid 
is drawn around 50% of 
the electrons of the 
element in the model. 
If the atom in the real 
molec ule is heav ier than the atom in the model, then the 
volume including 50% of the electrons of the modeled 
element is smaller.

          <text>Libration
AB
rrThe higher the temperature, the shor ter bond lengths appear to be, even 
though the unit cell gets slightly larger at  the same time. The reason for this is 
libration. Especially terminal atoms sh ow approximately circular motion. In 
anisotr opic re finement, this mo tion is fitt ed as an ellipsoid, the  center of which 
lies ins ide the circle of motion, while the atom is loated on its periphery. This 
effect makes the bond distance appear shorter.
Depending on the movement of the atoms,  the correction that needs to be 
applied is somewhere between 0.001 0.1 .Libration is much stronger at 
higher temperatures and particularly pronounced for hydrogen atoms, small 
ions, like NO3, BF4, ClO4, PF6and for CF3groups.

UAFor most low-temperature structures, 
the effects of libration are smaller than 
the standard uncertainties  of the bond 
lengths and it is not necessary to correct 
for it.[]

          <text>Structure Refinement
The structure solution from direct or Patterson methods is frequently 
already very good. Howev er, the coor dinates are not quite accurate, the 
atom types of some or all atoms have been assigned incorrectly (if at 
all), and details of the structure are missing (H-atoms, disorders, solvent 
molec ules, etc.).
The atomic positions in the first soluti on are not the direct result of the 
diffraction experiment, but an interp retation of the electron dens ity 
function calculated from the meas ured intensities and the somehow 
determined phase angles.
Better phases can be calculated from the atomic positions, whic hallow 
re-determining of the electron dens ity function with a higher precision. 
From the new elec tron dens ity map, mo re accurate atomic positions  can 
be derived, whic h lead to even bette r phase angles, and so forth. In 
every such cycle, adjustments to the atomic model are made: atom
types are changed, missing atoms are introduced, etc.
This whole process is called structure refinement.</text>

          <text>Problems and Pitfalls
The big advantages of X-ray structure anal ysis are that it is very objective 
and can determine the structure of ev en very complex molecules. E.g.
NSF + LiOC(CH3)3in C5H12NSOC(CH3)3+ LiF
{Li8[(CH3)3COS(F)N]4F2} {Li4[OC(CH3)3]5}24C5H12
Disadvantages are that you do need crys tals and that the accuracy of bond 
lengths and angles is relatively low (ca. 0.02 to 0.001 ). With some 
spectroscopic methods (e.g. rotational spectroscopy), interatomic distances 
can be determined 100 times more accurately.
Another disadvantage is that t he structure determined is the spatial 
average over the entire crystal and the temporal average over the data 
collection time (hours). This make s it impossible to study dynamic 
processes. However, those proce sses can leave their traces behind</text>

          <text>Structure Refinement: Electron Density Maps
Different electron dens ity maps:
Fomap: Electron dens ity calculated usin g observed structure factures 
combined with phases calculated from  the atomic model. This map 
shows  the observed electron density; its accuracy depends largely on 
the accuracy of the phases.
Fcmap: Electron dens ity calculated from  structure factors and phases 
calculated from the atomic model. This map shows  the electron dens ity 
according to the model only.
Fo-Fcmap: The difference between the two maps. Has close-to-zero 
values  for parts of the model that are cons istent with the experimental 
dens ity, large positive values at pl aces  where the model should have an 
atom, but does not, and large negative values  at places where the 
model has an atom, which should not be there. Weaker positive or
negative values for the Fo-Fcmap could point to wrongly assigned atom 
types.</text>

Often an inversion center or a centered lattice with higher symmetry 
are overlooked. A long series of papers by Marsh and others 
document wrong space groups reported in the literature.
A particularly revealing example was a P1 space group corrected by 
Marsh (1999) to C2;  this correction was then corrected to Fdd2 by 
Spek in 2000 ( Acta Cryst. B56 744).

290 K
112 KThermal motion of atoms in the crystal 
can also lead to large ADPs.
The very large ellipsoids in the anion 
N(SO2F)2at room temperature can be 
explained either with strong atomic 
movement or disorder. 
In this case, the normal staggered 
conformation at 112K and the ecliptic  
conformation at 290K make this look 
more like a disorder. This is 
corroborated by the bond lengths:

1.24 and 1.36
