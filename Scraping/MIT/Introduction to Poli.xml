But (continued) 
Empirically, long-lived dictators (Mobutu, Mugabe, the Duvaliers in 
Haiti) are not more developmental, and if anything seem to be among 
the most kleptocratic. 
Conceptually, this equates the state with organized banditry. But is 
that right? 
Theoretically, Olson s vision is too narrow also. 
Acemoglu and Robinson (APSR 2006): the relationship between 
entrenchment and likelihood to take actions against economic 
development is inverse U-shaped. This is because a very 
non-entrenched dictator has no reason to sabotage development in 
order to save his future rents. 
Acemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (JET 2010): from a repeated games 
perspective, a less entrenched dictator may be easier to discipline. This 
is because if he deviates, society can more easily punish him by 
removing him from power. We next explain this result.

Power and E ciency 
Consider an innite horizon economy in discrete time with a unique 
nal good, consisting of N parties (groups). 
Each party j has utility at time t = 0 given by 
E0 
t uj (cj,t , lj,t ), 
t=0 
where cj,t is consumption, lj,t is labor supply (or other types of 
productive eort), and E0 denotes the expectations operator at time 
t = 0. 

 Labor supply lies in [0, l] for each party, and let us make the usual 
assumptions on the utility function. 
Aggregate output is given by 
N 
Yt =lj,t . 
j =1

Is the Stationary Bandit Argument Compelling? 
Sanchez de la Sierra (2014) provides evidence for this perspective by 
exploiting the dierential increases in incentives of armed groups in 
the civil war of Eastern Congo to become stationary bandits 
because of the coltan price hike. 
Coltan is easier to tax because it s much harder to conceal than gold, 
so he uses gold as a control. 
He therefore hypothesizes that attempted conquests should 
increase due to the higher interaction of Coltan deposits and coltan 
price, but not the same for gold. 
Potentially consistent with the stationary bandit argument  the 
rebels may want to become stationary bandits when the returns are 
higher.

Reevaluating Olson 
One possible question concerns the conditions under which rst-best 
allocations are sustainable as SPE, and in particular how these depend 
on the Markov process for power switches. 
Proposition: Consider an economy consisting of N groups. Suppose that 
m (j | j)=  and m (j0| j)= (1  )/(N  1) for any j06= j. Then the 
set of sustainable rst-best allocations is decreasing in . 
Anti-Olson results. Why? 
Intuition: if  = 0 or very low, the group in power can be punished 
very strongly for extracting more than they are supposed to next 
period they will not be in power with high probability, and they can 
be taxed very heavily. 
Conversely, when  = 1 or very high, less eective punishments, thus 
rst-best publications are more di cult to sustain.

But 
Yet this is a rather indirect argument. 
The fact that these rebel groups are trying to control coltan-rich 
places when the price of coltan increases doesn t mean that they will 
act like stationary bandits (or will be building proto-states ). 
They may just be attracted by greater naked extraction.

Political Compromise 
We have so far stayed away from repeated game considerations. 
but these are potentially important, because they can generate 
political compromise. 
This this true under both democratic and nondemocratic institutions. 
In this lecture, we will discuss some of the implications and limits of 
such political compromise.

Markov Equilibrium 
In Markovian equilibria, parties, once in power, choose their ideal 
point as policy. 
Knowing this, citizens have no choice but select whichever party is 
closer to their own bliss point, 0. 
This is partly B. 
So this party will be elected in each period.

The Entrenchment Argument 
We will see the entrenchment argument more clearly in the next two 
lectures. 
But the main idea is that if bandits/dictators/politicians have a way 
of manipulating things in order to stay in power, then having them 
longer livedor more forward-looking is not good. 
Here, we will develop the alternative argument against stationary 
bandits in Acemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2010).

Commitment and Noncommitment in Democracy 
Consider a model related to Alesina (1989). 
There are two parties that are ideologically dierent and unable to 
commit to policies. 
But they are competing dynamically. 
Can they compromise and stay away from their ideological extremes?

Political Compromise in Nondemocracies 
The Olson stationary bandit argument: Mancur Olson formulated 
the now famous stationary bandit argument (Maguire and Olson, 
1996). 
It goes like this: 
What is bad for a society is to have a number of bandits that come and 
go and rob citizens. They will apply maximal extraction, and thus kill 
any incentive for investment or eort. 
If instead there is a single bandit that stays around (a stationary 
bandit ), that s not so bad, because the bandit can use repeated game 
strategies. 
Taking away everything would discourage investment. Thus the bandit 
has an incentive to establish a reputation for taking only part of what 
is produced, thus encouraging people to continue producing.

Repeated Game Equilibria: Further Issues 
Question: why did we choose party A as the one to be in power and 
implement the Condorcet winner policy of voters? 
Question: how would you support an equilibrium in which party B is 
induced to choose the Condorcet winner policy? 
Question: what happens if we allow nonstationary strategies? Can we 
do better? 
What will the Pareto frontier look like? (See, for example, Dixit, 
Grossman and Gul, 2000).

Political Economy (continued) 
Here MPE are straightforward and uninteresting (like Olson s roving 
bandits): maximum extraction every period by that group in power 
from all other groups. 
But Subgame Perfect Equilibria (SPE) potentially more interesting. 
These will have the feature that the current powerholder can be 
punished by high taxes/extraction in the future if it does not follow 
the agreed policy. 
The set of SPE is generally large, but one might wish to focus on the 
constrained Pareto e cient SPE (i.e., the frontier). 
Note that it is not possible to focus on a single point on this frontier, 
because as the identity of the group in power is stochastic, we will 
naturally move along this frontier.

          <text>Voting with Incomplete Information Swing Voter s Curse 
Intuition 
If U (1, )= U (0, ), meaning that an uninformed voter is indierent 
between voting for either candidate (policy), then he or she must 
prefer to abstain. 
By continuity, we could also show that if |U (1, )  U (0, )| &lt;  for 
 su ciently small, then the same conclusion will apply. This is 
despite the fact that uninformed voters actually have relevant 
information, because the prior  can be arbitrarily small. 
Intuitively, when a voter expects the same utility from the two options 
available to him or her, then abstaining and leaving the decision to 
another voter who is more likely to be informed is better. 
This is despite the fact that the voter may be leaving the decision to 
a committed type. 
Dierent from the implications of models in which swing voters are 
powerful .

Discussion 
Results depend on hyper rational voters . Is this realistic? 
On the other hand, the resulting voting rule may be simple : abstain 
if you do not have strong information. But this conclusion is still 
follows from a complicated reasoning and sometimes mixed strategies 
are necessary. 
How to interpret the result that the correct action will be taken in 
large elections?

Any Voter s Curse 
But if voters are strategic in this fashion and vote just to be pivotal, 
turnout will be extremely low with even trivial costs of voting. 
Turnout has to be low in particular in order to make each voter be 
pivotal with a su ciently high probability. 
No way of explaining turnout rates of 20 or 30% in large elections (let 
alone 60 or 70%).

Swing Voter s Curse 
The key observation in the analysis of this model is that, as in the 
jury problem, an individual should only care about his or her vote 
conditional on being pivotal. 
Since they do not obtain direct utility from their votes and only care 
about the outcome, their votes when there is a clear majority for one 
or the other outcome are irrelevant. 
But this implies that one has to condition on a situation in which 
one is pivotal in a large election. 
This happens (in the unlikely event) where either an equal number of 
agents have voted for each choice, or one of the two choices is 
winning with only one vote.

Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in the Limit 
It can be shown (as it is intuitive) that as n increases, the probability 
of convicting the defendant converges increases, and as n  , it 
converges to a positive number. 
Thus large juries will over-convict  they also convict the guilty with 
probability 1. 
Why? 
Essentially, each juror nds it optimal to rely on the implicit 
information that if her vote is pivotal, it must be that others have 
voted to convict, and that s pretty good evidence that the defendant 
is guilty. 
Put dierently, no one wants to be a contrarian and acquit when 
others are voting to convict.

Unanimity 
The key assumption is that the jury requires unanimity to reach the 
verdict of x = G . 
Let the vote of juror j be denoted by vj {g, i}. Then x = G if 
vj = g for all j. 
Suppose also that each member j of the group has the following 
payo:  
 0 if x =  
uj (x, )= z if x = G and  = I   (1  z) if x = I and  = G 
where z  [0; 1]. 
This in particular implies that convicting an innocent defendant has a 
higher negative payo when z is greater (leading to more conservative 
decisions).

A Modern Jury Problem 
But let s dig a little bit deeper into this (following Fedderson and 
Pesendorfer, 1998). 
There are n jury members who have to decide whether to convict a 
defendant. 
There are no conicts of interest  all jury members would like to 
convict the defendant if he is guilty, denoted by the underlying state 
 = G , but not if he is innocent,  = I . 
Each jury starts with a common prior that the defendant is guilty with 
probability   (0, 1). 
Then receives a signal s = {g, i} (for example, from their reading of 
the evidence presented at the trial). Suppose that the signals are 
conditionally independent and identically distributed and satisfy 
Pr (s = g | = G )= p and Pr (s = i| = I )= q; q, p &gt; 0.5 .

          <text>Voting with Incomplete Information Introduction 
The Condorcet Jury Theorem 
The rst person to think about such issues was again Condorcet. 
Condorcet reasoned about the jury problem, where all jurors have the 
same interests, and would like to convict a defendant if he is guilty. 
But each has incomplete information (say a signal about the 
underlying state of nature). 
Condorcet reasoned that if they all pool their information  say by 
voting sincerely  then with a su ciently large jury, the law of large 
numbers will kick in and the dispersed information of the jurors will 
be well aggregated. 
So voting acts as a good way of information aggregation. 
This point was picked up about a century later by Francis Galton, 
who developed the idea of the wisdom of the crowd and provided 
fascinating evidence consistent with it.

Best Responses 
When will a juror vote to convict? 
Suppose rst that the juror expects not to be pivotal  meaning that 
her vote doesn t matter. This will in particular happen when other 
jurors have already voted to acquit (since the jury requires 
unanimity). In such cases her vote doesn t matter, so voting v = G 
has no payo implications. 
Instead, her vote matters (if and only) if she is pivotal, meaning that 
all n  1 other jurors have voted to convict. 
In this case, she would like to induce a collective decision (a jury 
verdict) such that 
x = I if Pr( = G |information set)  z. 
This simply says that given the costs of convicting an innocent, she 
would only like to convict the defendant if the probability that he is 
guilty is greater than z.

A Common Value Model (continued) 
A candidate (policy) that obtains an absolute majority is chosen. If 
both options obtain the same number of votes, then one of them is 
chosen at random. 
Let us suppose, without loss of any generality, that the prior 
probability that the true state is  = 0 is   1/2, so that state 
 = 1 is more likely ex ante. 
To make the model work, there needs to be some uncertainty about 
the preferences of other voters. One way to introduce this is to 
suppose that how many other voters there are (meaning how many 
other voters could potentially turn out to vote) and what fractions of 
those will be committed types are stochastically generated. (This is 
the assumption rst developed in Myerson and Weber, 1993).

Bayesian Nash Equilibrium 
Let us now understand how the Bayesian-Nash equilibrium works 
when P1 &gt; z. (We note that this will always be the case when n is 
large. Is 12 large?). 
Then sincere voting is not an equilibrium. 
But clearly, voting to convict always cannot be in equilibrium either. 
The Bayesian-Nash equilibrium will then be in mixed strategies. In 
particular, suppose that vj = g if sj = g, but also 
vj = g with probability  if sj = i. 
For such an equilibrium, we need each juror to be indierent between 
voting guilty and innocent when they receive sj = i. In other words, 
P1 = Pr( = G |vj = g for all j 6= 1 and s1 = i) = z.

Lessons 
Voting in common-interest in complete information situations will be 
very dierent than what we have seen so far. 
If voters are hyper-rational to be able to make such inferences, they 
will have a tendency to distort their information (thus not engage in 
sincere voting ). 
But this may also involve major ine ciencies, very dierent from 
Condorcet s Jury Theorem. 
Does this mean voting is always a very bad way of aggregating 
information? Well, yes and no.

          <text>Voting with Incomplete Information Introduction 
Voting for Being Pivotal 
Suppose that voters are strategic  they vote because they think 
they may be pivotal and are hyper rational so that they can 
understand the likelihood of being so. 
If we have a model of pure redistributive politics with two options, 
then each voter will vote for the option that maximizes his or her 
utility (with the usual arguments after ruling out weakly dominated 
strategies). 
But what if there is also a common interest element? 
In this case, each voter would like to maximize his or her utility, but 
this involves taking into account when he or she will be pivotal 
conditional on the state. Similar to common value auctions. 
In this lecture, we will develop these ideas formally and then provide 
some evidence as to whether these kinds of considerations will matter 
in actual voting decisions.

Evidence? 
We will discuss evidence in the next lecture. 
But it s worth mentioning the work by Battaglini, Morton and Palfrey 
(2008, 2010), which looks at voting behavior in reasonable-sized lab 
experiments with common values (as with the model here). 
They nd support for two of the key features here: 
Swing voter s curse: abstention by low information independent voters. 
Swing voter s cunning strategy: they mix in a way to encourage more 
informed independence to be pivotal (and this cunning strategy is 
stronger when there is greater imbalance between committed voters as 
theory would suggest).

          <text>Voting with Incomplete Information Swing Voter s Curse 
A Model of a Large Election 
Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996) consider the following environment. 
There our two states of nature,  = {0, 1}, and two policy choices of 
candidates, x {0, 1}. 
There are three types of voters, denoted by elements of the type 
space T = {0, 1, i}. 
The rst two are committed voters and will always choose x = 0 or 
x = 1 either because of distributional or ideological reasons. 
The last one designates independent voters, which we normally 
think as the swing voters . These independents have preferences 
given by 
Ui (x, )= I (x 6= ) , 
where I (x 6= ) is the indicator function for the position of the 
candidate from being dierent than the state of nature. 
This implies that the voters received negative utility if the wrong 
candidate is elected.

          <text>Voting with Incomplete Information Swing Voter s Curse 
Implications 
The implication is that useful information will be lost in the elections, 
and this is the essence of the swing voter s curse . 
Nevertheless, Feddersen and Pesendorfer also show that in large 
elections information still aggregates in the sense that the correct 
choice is made with arbitrarily high probability. In particular: 
Proposition 
Suppose that p &gt; 0, q &gt; 0 and pi 6= |p1  p0|, then for every  &gt; 0, 
  there exists N such that for N &gt; N, the probability that the correct 
candidate gets elected is greater than 1  . 
The idea of this result is that as the size of the electorate becomes 
large, uninformed independents mix between the disadvantaged 
candidate and abstaining, in such a way that informed independents 
become pivotal with very high probability.

          <text>Voting with Incomplete Information Swing Voter s Curse 
Swing Voter s Curse (continued) 
This intuition is su cient to establish the following proposition, which 
captures the idea of the swing voter s curse . 
Let U (x, ) be the expected utility of an uninformed independent 
agent to choose x {0, 1, }, when all other independents are using 
(symmetric) mixed strategies given by . 
Proposition 
Suppose that p &gt; 0, q &gt; 0 and that N is greater than 2 and even. Then 
if U (1, )= U (0, ), then all uninformed independent voters abstain.

Measuring Democracy 
To test this prediction, we need to measure of democracy or 
democratizations. This is in general tricky. 
Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson (2014, 2017) developed a 
binary index based on several sources. 
Using this annual measure of democracy, they investigate the eects 
of democratizations on taxes, revenues and inequality. 
there are several econometric issues one has to be careful about 
(serial correlation, endogeneity, Nickell bias, etc.) 
All the same, for our focus here, the robust result is that 
democratizations leads to higher taxes and government revenues.

Add Frictions 
The previous result is no longer true if there are frictions . 
The most obvious friction is idiosyncratic party preferences as in the 
probabilistic voting model. In this case, each politician has a captured 
audience, and will be able to push his policies (at least a little bit) in 
the direction of his bliss point. (What is a simple proof of this?) 
Another friction might be preventing certain types of parties from 
entering. For example, parties representing the interests of certain 
ethnic groups or worker groups are banned from elections in many 
countries (e.g., Turkey, Burma). 
If we have that both parties are to the right of the median voter, then 
the above theorem doesn t work.

Democracy and Redistribution 
Consider a model similar to that discussed in the second lecture, 
where each individual has income yi and the only scal tools are a 
linear income tax and lump-sum redistribution. 
As a result, the most preferred tax rate of a richer individual is lower 
than that of a poorer individual (holding everything else including the 
distribution of income constant). 
Suppose that individuals are ranked according to income, and only 
those above the qth percentile are enfranchised. An extension of the 
franchise  a democratization  is a decline in this percentile. 
Theorem 
Consider an extension of the franchise. This always increases taxes and 
redistribution.

Why Democracy May Not Impact Inequality? 
There are several possibilities: 
Democracy is captured and is not responsive. But if so, why are taxes 
going up? 
Democracy is responsive to the middle class, and the middle class may 
want lower redistribution towards the poor when the poor are added to 
the franchise. 
Democratizations may change the structure of the economy, creating 
more inequality-generating opportunities (e.g., the fall of apartheid in 
South Africa). 
Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson provide evidence consistent 
with the second and third channels. But nothing denitive.

Introduction 
How does voting work out in practice? 
The answer is: in a much more complicated way than the simplest 
theory would suggest  perhaps not surprisingly. 
In this lecture, I will focus on three aspects of this problem: 
1 
2 To what extent do voters vote strategically? Why do they turn out? 
To what extent do the Dowsian prediction of convergence to the 
middle/the median voter s preferences work out in practice? 
3 Do political decisions reect the preferences of the median 
voter/voters?

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Why and How Do Voters Vote? 
Social Pressure 
By social pressure, I mean the fact that voters do not really enjoy 
voting, but feel compelled to do so because others will shun or 
ostracize them if they are seen not to vote. 
This idea is investigated in a recent creative paper by Della Vigna et 
al. (2017). 
They design a eld experiment with door-to-door canvassing in 
Chicago following the 2010 congressional elections. 
The creative new element is that the arrival of canvassers is 
preannounced to one of the treatment groups, and incentives to lie 
about past voting are manipulated. 
Design: no yer group receives no yers, treatment groups receive 
yers that do or do not mentioned election, and the opt out groups 
receive a yer with a box to check if they do not want to be disturbed.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Dowsian Convergence 
Non-Convergence in Theory 
One possibility, which is not unrealistic even if it s not exciting 
theoretically, is that parties are unable to make binding commitments 
to policies. 
If so, then voters will choose candidates based on what they expect 
they will do once in o ce. 
This is a perspective adopted in citizen-candidate type models, 
such as Osborne and Slivinski (1996) or Besley and Coate (1997), 
whose main focus is the modeling of entry decisions of candidates.

Policy Responsiveness 
The lack of Dowsian policy convergence does not imply that policies 
are not, on average, responsive to voter preferences. 
At some level whether this is the case or not is much more important. 
Investigating this issue is made complicated by the fact that we don t 
generally know what voters want. But there is one setting in which 
we infer changes in voter preferences  de jure or de facto changes in 
the voting franchise. 
In contrast to comparative statics with respect to inequality, which we 
saw not to be robust in the second lecture, comparative statics with 
respect to changes in the voting franchise are fairly straightforward.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Do Voters Vote Strategically? 
Do Voters Vote Strategically? 
We have seen that whether voters vote sincerely or strategically 
matters in the presence of common-interest policy choices and 
incomplete information. 
Even more simply, the same issues arise when there are more than two 
candidates/options in an election. 
Why should you vote for somebody who is your rst choice but sure 
to lose when you can support somebody that has a chance to win? 
The problem is that we know people do support sure losers, so either 
not everybody votes strategically or there are other considerations 
(direct utility?). 
Part of the literature investigates whether there is any evidence for 
strategic voting and how important it is.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Do Voters Vote Strategically? 
Duverger s Law and Strategic Voting 
One implication of strategic voting is Duverger s Law, which claims 
that with simple majority, single-ballot elections, there will be a 
strong tendency towards a two-party system, because strategic voting 
considerations will make voters shun non-contender parties. In 
contrast, proportional representation or dual-ballot system can 
support multiple parties. 
Fujiwara (2011) tests this implication using a regression-discontinuity 
design based on dierent voting systems in place in Brazilian 
municipalities based on population. 
In municipal elections (for mayors), a single ballot or the dual ballot 
system is used below and above the cuto of 200,000.

nominate scores as a summary of the voting record (from rollcall 
votes) of U.S. House members. 
They also look at likelihood of voting the same way as the

Summary 
Though there are much more complicated patterns in practice, the 
evidence is consistent with the idea that voters to vote in line with 
(some) of their interests, and policies to change in response to major 
changes such as the enfranchisements 
But at the same time, we are far from the Dowsian framework.

Why Do Voters Vote? 
As we have seen, it is di cult to get people to turn out if they are 
voting to be pivotal (unless voting is costless or pleasurable). 
So this means there are three sets of reasons why people might be 
turning out: 
They enjoy voting. 
 1 
2 
3 They are subject to social pressure. 
They vote because of some moral/ethical considerations.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Dowsian Convergence 
Testing Dowsian Convergence 
The Dowsian convergence result, discussed in the rst two lectures, is 
viewed as iconic of basic voting theory. 
It has attracted considerable attention from social scientists and 
beyond. 
As these things go, it is also a relatively easy theory to test. 
One approach is to use regression discontinuity design: holding the 
ideology of the electorate constant, which party gets elected shouldn t 
matter if we are indeed in the Dowsian world. 
Several papers have attacked this problem.

Social Pressure (continued) 
The results indicate signicant social image considerations: people 
avoid the canvassing when they are informed that there will be 
questions about past voting. 
They are also willing to pay signicantly to avoid this. 
In particular, rates of answering the door and completing the survey 
are lower among non-voters if the yer mentions the election, and 
non-voters given the opt-out option that mentions election are 
signicantly less likely to answer the door.

No Dowsian Convergence in India 
Another implication of non-convergence is that the identity of the 
politician will matter. 
There is a subliterature investigating this issue with politicians 
 gender or other characteristics. 
One example is Chattopathyay and Duo (2004), looking at women 
brought to power at the panchayat level in India because of political 
reservations based on gender.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Why and How Do Voters Vote? 
Do Voters Enjoy Voting? 
This is not an easy question to answer. 
So instead we can look at whether once you induce people to start 
voting (exogenously), they continue to vote. 
This is the so-called habit-formation hypothesis, for which you can 
go back as far as Aristotle (on ethical behavior feeding into further 
ethical behavior). 
More recently advocated by Brody and Sniderman (1977). We know 
that there are signicant persistent dierences in likelihood of voting 
across groups and individuals. But a huge identication problem. 
Gerber, Green and Shachar (2003) provide evidence using the 
vote-canvassing RCT in Connecticut. 
They encourage voting with door-to-door canvassing and phone calls 
before the 1998 general election, and then look at the eects on 
voting behavior in 1998, and then in a subsequent election in 1999.

Testing Strategic Voting Using Two Linked Elections 
Spenkuc h (2017) uses the German voting system, where each 
individual has two votes  a list vote for a party, counted that the 
national level, which approximates a proportional voting system; and 
a candidate vote, counted at the district level in a rst-past-the-post 
electoral system. 
As is well known, in proportional voting systems (barring issues about 
strategic thinking on legislative bargaining etc.), individuals have 
incentives to vote sincerely . 
In rst-past-the-post elections, there are reasons for deviating from 
sincere voting.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Dowsian Convergence 
What Happens with Policy-Motivated Politicians? 
Instead, suppose that parties/politicians can commit to policies, but 
have policy preferences. 
For example, one party may prefer right-wing policies the other one 
left-wing ones. 
What happens in this case? 
Theorem 
Suppose we are in the baseline model with single-peaked or single-crossing 
preferences, and the two parties have their own policy platforms, one to 
the left of the median the other one to the right of the median. The 
unique equilibrium is Dowsian policy convergence. 
Why?

Summary 
Overall, quite a bit of evidence that there is some strategic voting, 
and perhaps quite a bit of it. 
But this evidence doesn t really speak to whether people are very 
sophisticated or just so-so strategic. 
Strategic voting may not be inconsistent with rule-utilitarianism 
either.

Interpretation 
Overall, the evidence is fairly clear that at least the strong form of 
Dowsian policy convergence doesn t hold (reality check, think of the 
US at the moment). 
But how do we make sense of this? 
So let s think about theory again.

De Facto Enfranchisement 
Certain voters may be disenfranchised because of practices or their 
inability to eectively express their voice. 
Fujiwara (2015) investigates a setting, whereby the introduction of 
new technology (electronic voting) enables previously de facto 
disenfranchised low-education voters to increase their voting and their 
inuence. 
In Brazil, before this voting technology, the complicated nature in 
which voting would have to take place meant that the ballots of a 
large fraction of low-education, poor voters were spoilt. (25% of 
adults at the time were unable to read or write a simple note). 
This changed with the introduction of electronic voting in the 
mid-1990s, and did so above a threshold, enabling a regression 
discontinuity design. 
One expectation might be that these low-education voters would be 
ineective voters even after the change in technology. 
This is not what Fujiwara nds.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Why and How Do Voters Vote? 
Rule Utilitarianism 
John Harsanyi proposed the idea of rule utilitarianism, whereby 
individuals vote taking their group s interest, rather than their own 
interest, into account. 
Thus individuals may turn out even if it is costly for them because 
they are adopting a rule that they want others to adopt also (do 
unto others as you would like them to do unto you. . .  
Some argue that this perspective is most useful for thinking about 
voting behavior, but direct empirical evidence is di cult to generate.

          <text>Voting and Political Decisions in Practice Dowsian Convergence 
Interpretation 
Clear partisan behavior from marginally elected Democrats and/or 
Republicans. 
Does this clearly reject Dowsian policy convergence? 
Yes and no  elected representatives are clearly not the same 
regardless of which party they come from; but they are not 
determining policy (they may be non-pivotal in the House). 
The pure Dowsian framework requires policy to be convergent  and 
thus its rejection requires that we show party identity to matter for 
policy. 
This is what Pettersson-Lidbom (2008) does using data from Swedish 
municipalities, and nds candidates from the social democrats to lead 
to higher spending and taxes, and more government employees, and 
lower unemployment..

Women s Enfranchisement 
Similar issues come into action when those being enfranchised aren t 
the poor but women. 
Miller (2008) looks at this in the context of the United States  US 
states enfranchised women between 1869 and 1920. 
He nds greater municipality based on spending following women s 
enfranchisement and signicant impacts on one of the issues about 
which women care  child survival/mortality.

          <text>Pre-analysis plans 
Given these concerns people have started to write pre-analysis plans 
to commit to which hypotheses they will test. Standard in medical 
trials. How might this help? 
Reduce the number of yi and deal with concerns about data-mining 
and multiple hypothesis testing 
Pre-commit to which X you will interact with 
Pre-commit to regression specications. 
Why are these more common in RCTs than non-RCTs? 
Helpful to the extent they limit you. But you may not want to be too 
limited. Current area where people are actively working things out. 
P-set will talk about one example (Casey et al) related to institutions
and building colletive action. Other recent examples include Alatas et
al (2012), Finkelstein et al (2012), etc. See also Olken (2015).

          <text>Collective action and heterogeneity 
Intuition: 
The Olson eect operates here as well. Group size in this framework 
matters only because your incentive to put in eort depend in part on 
what is happening in your group and bigger groups discourage eort. 
So having more smaller groups increases eort. 
In order to capture the intuition that heterogeneity hurts, we need to 
look for a context where the free-rider problem is not the big problem. 
Instead, well look at a context where the problem is heterogeneity in 
tastes

          <text>Enhancing collective action 
Spurred on by ideas in the 2004 World Development Report, there 
were numerous attempts to test whether one could somehow increase 
collective action by reducing the costs of participating in monitoring 
behaviors 
Will not solve free ride problem of course 
But may nevertheless be important if one cannot solve these problems

          <text>Local capture is a very old idea 
Federalist Papers #10 (1787) 
Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by 
intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, rst obtain the surages, and then 
betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is, whether small or 
extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the 
public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious 
considerations: 
In the rst place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, 
the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against 
the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a 
certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, 
the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of 
the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it 
follows that, if the proportion of t characters be not less in the large than in the 
small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a 
greater probability of a t choice.

          <text>Overview 
Collective action failures stem from misalignment of private and 
collective incentives (e.g., Olson) 
In the developing world, one way this manifests itself is insu!cient 
monitoring of local o!cials 
Teachers and health workers not coming to work 
Local o!cials stealing funds from central government projects 
(much more to come on these issues in the corruption lectures) 
So many suggest that a natural solution to this problem is to increase 
the ability of citizens to monitor local o!cials 
In fact, this is precisely what the World Bank suggested in the 2004 
World Development Report : 
Putting poor people at the center of service provision: enabling them 
to monitor and discipline service providers, amplifying their voice in 
policymaking, and strengthening the incentives for service providers to 
serve the poor.

          <text>Evidence from Kenya 
Miguel and Gugerty (2005): Ethnic diversity, social sanctions, and public goods in 
Kenya 
Setting: school funding and facilities in rural Kenya 
Slightly dierent theoretical motivation: 
They posit no preference heterogeneity over these types of goods 
Instead, they think about voluntary contributions (not compulsory 
taxes), with social sanctions for non-payment 
Assume no ability to impose social sanctions across ethnic groups 
Empirical approach: 
Low residential mobility implies that ethnic heterogeneity is 
exogenously determined with respect to public goods provision (e.g., no 
Tiebout sorting) 
Compare contributions cross-sectionally

          <text>Road Building in Indonesia 
Olken 2007: Monitoring Corruption: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia 
Setting: 
608 villages in rural Indonesia, each of which was building a 1-3km road 
Roads are built by a 3-person village implementation committee 
Three village-wide accountability meetings where the committee has 
to account for how they spent the funds, after 40%, 80%, and 100% of 
funds allocated. 
Scope for improvement: 
Like India and Uganda, these meetings do not look very eective: 
village head typically only invites the elite, and they almost always 
approve the accountability report 
Baseline estimates: 25% of funds cant be accounted for, so potentially 
pervasive corruption 
Question: does improving the functioning of these monitoring 
meetings reduce corruption in the project? 
Note: the same project also investigated top-down audits: we will 
discuss more in the corruption lectures

          <text>Health in Uganda 
Bjorkman and Svensson 2009: Power to the People: Evidence from a Randomized Field 
Experiment on Community-Based Monitoring in Uganda 
Setting: 50 health centers (dispensaries) in rural Uganda 
Each dispensary provides preventive care, outpatient care, maternity, 
lab services to a population of about 2,500 households 
Situation is similar to the Indian education context in Banerjee et al. 
in many ways: 
Many problems at baseline  stockout rate of 50% of basic drugs, only 
41% use any equipment at all during examinations 
Scope for collective action through Health Unit Management 
Committee (HUMC), which consists of health workers and non-political 
representatives of community. Supposed to monitor but does not have 
hiring/ring power. Very similar to VECs.

Setting: Examines the impact of television (and radio) on social 
capital in over 600 Indonesian villages 
Main source of identication: plausibly exogenous variation in signal 
strength associated with the mountainous terrain of East / Central 
Java 
Additional sources of identication: 
Compare social capital in subdistricts before and after introduction of 
private television in 1993 
Use model of electromagnetic signal propagation to explicitly isolate 
impact of topography 
Then: to see if it matters, examine the impact of television reception 
on corruption in road projects

          <text>Implications 
Collective action is harder in larger groups because the misalignment 
of private and social incentives is larger. 
Olson goes on from here to argue that this is why small interest 
groups tend to get their own way: they are better at collectively 
articulating their demands 
In this model however Ae is always increasing in n. 
To get at that possibility we need to bring in the idea that smaller 
groups have higher stakes per capita. 
In other words we now introduce the idea that there is some private 
component in the returns from collective action.

          <text>Interventions 
Invitations 
Idea: number and composition of people at meeting aects 
information, bias 
Intervention: distribute hundreds of written invitations 3-5 days before 
meeting to lower cost of attending, to reduce elite dominance and 
increase participation at meetings 
Comment Forms 
Idea: anonymity reduces private cost of revealing corruption 
Intervention: invitations + distributed anonymous comment forms 
Forms has questions on information, road quality, prices, nancial 
management, plus open-ended questions 
Collect forms 1-2 days before meeting in sealed drop-boxes, and read 
summary of comments at meeting 
Sub-variants of both treatments: 
Number: 300 or 500 invitations 
Insiders: Distribute invitations via village government or primary 
schools

          <text>Discussion 
Summary of results 
Interventions aected the process at meetings 
But eects were too small to matter overall  if taking a serious 
action eliminated corruption entirely, impact of comment forms would 
be to reduce missing expenditures by 0.68 percentage points 
But important heterogeneity suggests that details matter for 
combating free riding and elite capture 
Invitations reduced theft of labor, and laborers are the ones with high 
personal returns to reducing corruption 
Comment forms worked only if distributed via schools where elite 
capture was lower (in fact comment forms were more negative, but 
corruption was lower!) 
Does this help us reconcile India vs. Uganda? What would?

          <text>Do they use this local information? 
This says that there is some local information beyond what the 
government observes. 
But, the question is, can we extract that local information. 
To test this, we held community meetings where, in a public forum, 
people ranked each other from richest to poorest. Poorest ones got 
the money

Casey et al (2012), Reshaping Institutions: Evidence on Aid Impacts Using a

One potential concern with empirical exercises is that you have many, 
many potential outcomes 
Go back and look at a standard survey and see how many questions 
there are 
Moreover, if you are interested in heterogeneous eects, you have 
many possible regressions 
In an RCT for a given yi , not that many choices in how to run: 
yi = a + bTi + #i . 
But if youre interested in 
yi = a + gXi + bTi + yTi  Xi + #i 
then now you can run this a zillion ways, with dierent interaction

Banerjee, Banerji, Duo, Glennerster, and Khemani (2010): Pitfalls of Participatory 
Programs: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in India 
Setting: education in Uttar Pradesh, India 
Baseline situation: substantial problems with teacher absence and 
teacher laziness, and 39 percent of children age 7-14 could not read 
and understand a simple (grade 1 level) story 
Scope for collective action: each school has a Village Education 
Committee (VEC) 
Consists of three parents, the head teacher, and the head of village 
government 
Charged with intermediating between village government and 
bureaucracy, monitoring performance of schools, and controlling some 
share of the school budget (e.g., community-based teachers, 
supplemental allowances) 
But VECs are generally ineectual: 
At baseline, most parents did not know the VEC existed 
Many VEC members did not know their responsibilities

Specics of intervention 
Conduct baseline survey of health problems and quality of services 
Create facility-specic report card of service delivery, including 
comparison to other facilities 
Use community-based organizations to hold facilitated meetings with: 
Community. Two-day event, including about 150 people. Discussed 
patients rights, how to improve service delivery, etc. Culminated in 
action plan of improvements. 
Health providers. One-afternoon with all sta. Discussed report card

Alatas et al (2012): Targeting the Poor: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia 
Alatas et al are interested in the question of targeting, i.e. 
We are trying to give aid to the poor 
How do we gure out who is poor? 
Two approaches: 
Use limited information available to the central government. 
Survey of assets: 48 variables total. Examples: type of wall, roof, etc; 
have a car, sofa, refrigerator, etc. 
Predict consumption from assets using a regression, and eligible if 
y = X 0 b &lt; y
Try to elicit information from the community

          <text>Test of local information 
To test whether there is local information, we: 
Randomly surveyed 9 households in each neighborhood. Asked about 
consumption (unobservable to central government), assets (observable 
to central government), and subjective well being 
Asked each of these households to rank the other 8 households from 
richest to poorest. 
Then ran the following regression: 
rij = a + gyi + Xi 0 b + #ij
where j is ranker and i is the rankee, y is within village rank based on 
consumption, and X 0 b is what the central government observes
What does this test?

          <text>Improving collective action 
Substantively, several recent studies (including this one) have looked 
at whether external programs that sought to improve collective action 
had spillovers to institutions more broadly 
Broadly speaking: nd impact only under limited circumstances 
Casey et al (2012)  community driven development in Sierra Leone: 
no impact 
Fearon et al (2014)  community driven development in Liberia. Find 
some evidence that program increased contributions in a matching 
game, but only when both men and women were asked to be included. 
Beath et al (2013)  exogenous creation of elected councils. Find that 
when they deliver wheat to the villages and have councils deliver them, 
aid is delivered with better targeting and less leakage. But without 
clear specication of control rights, worse outcomes. 
Common theme of last two papers: you can set up new institutions 
that deal better with new problems, but not existing problems.

Improving Collective Action 2.0 
Pradhan et al (2014), Improving Educational Quality through Enhancing Community 
Participation 
The previous papers suggest that the details matter 
Pradhan et al conduct an experiment to try to tease this out, testing 
four interventions aimed at improving Indonesian school committees 
in 420 communities: 
Block grants. School committee receives grant of $870. Supposed to 
develop plan for expenditure with assistance of faciltiators (13 visits). 
What does this test? 
Training . Two day training of 4 school committee members (principal, 
teacher, parent, village rep). Focused on creating plan for how to 
spend block grant, but also taught active learning, school-based 
management, visit to model school etc. What does this test? 
Elections. Broadened participation in election of committee members 
(so not de facto appointed by principals). What does this test? 
Linkages. Linked school committee with local village parliament, in 
attemt to broaden their inuence. What does this test? 
by the version How does this design help answer the questions raised

          <text>Local capture is a very old idea 
Federalist Papers #10 (1787) 
In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of 
citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more di!cult for 
unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections 
are too often carried; and the surages of the people being more free, will be 
more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most 
diusive and established characters.

          <text>Does social capital matter? 
Miguel and Gugerty paper suggested that contributions are enforced 
through social sanctions 
This is connected to a broader idea, that social capital is an 
important supporter of collective action 
E.g., Putnam  Making Democracy Work and Bowling Alone 
Could be because people trust each other (with trust enforced through 
links on social network) 
Could be because social links are a way to exclude people who fail to 
participate 
Examples of models of this: Ambrus et al (2014) AER show that 
informal insurance is easier to sustain if groups are more interlinked

          <text>Decentralization and Local Capture 
Broadly speaking, there are two ways of framing decentralization: 
The public nance framework (e.g. Tiebout 1956). 
Heterogeneity in preferences for local public goods 
(amounts/quantities) 
But, economies of scale in production of those public goods, which are 
presumed to be heterogeneous within jurisdictions. This leads to a 
tradeo for optimal size of jurisdictions. 
Idea is that people sort into whichever jurisdiction oers the bundle of 
tax / public goods they want. 
The political economy framework (e.g. Bardhan and Mookerjee 2000) 
Better local information at the local level (about either preferences for 
public goods, or facts about how best to implement them) 
But, there may be capture by local elites. Not clear why we think local 
elites will capture more than non-local elites, but people do tend to 
think this. 
Mechanism design question: can you get the information out of local 
elites without capture?

Decisions 
Within each period, each agent makes the following decisions: 
j jan occupation choice et {0, 1}, and in addition if e= 1, i.e., if he t 
becomes an entrepreneur, 
investment, employment, and hiding decisions, ktj , lj and htj , where hj 
t t 
denotes whether he decides to hide his output in order to avoid 
taxation (since the nal good is not storable, the consumption decision 
is simply given by the budget constraint). 
Agents also make the policy choices in this society. 
Three policy choices: 
a tax rate t  [0, 1] on output,

Introduction 
So far the focus has been on democratic decision-making (voting, 
electoral control, dynamics of constituencies) 
But most countries in the world throughout the 20th century and 
today are not democratic 
Even when they have democratic institutions, the democratic system 
seems rather dysfunctional . 
We now turn to an analysis of how economic and political decisions 
are made in non-democratic situations with a given social group, the 
elite, in power. 
This will then open the way for a more systematic analysis of 
institutional change

Evidence for Oligarchic Stagnation 
In a very interesting paper Stasavage (2014) argues that autonomous 
cities provides an illustration of oligarchic growth followed by 
stagnation. 
The cities were dominated by merchant guilds, who subsequently 
blocked the introduction of new technologies and rise of new 
industries. 
But early on, they also provided secure property rights for merchants. 
This ts the general set of ideas discussed in this lecture. 
The evidence is suggestive  rapid city population growth for 
autonomous cities, and then stagnation.

Holdup 
Political failures are introduced if investments are long term so that 
tax decisions are made partly after investments are sunk. 
Change the timing of events such that: 
1 
2 individual producers undertake their investments; 
the elite set taxes. 
The elite will no longer take the discourage of taxes on investment 
into account in the MPE. 
Therefore 
= HP   Proposition: With holdup, there is a unique MPE with m t 
for all t. 
Now greater distortions and potential Pareto ine ciencies.

Oligarchy Equilibrium 
Policies are determined by majoritarian voting among the elite. 
At the time of voting over the entry barriers, bt , the elite are the ones 
inheriting the entrepreneurial state, i.e., those with st = 1, and at the 
time of voting over the taxes, t , the elite are those with et = 1. 
Let us start with the taxation decision among those with et = 1. 
It can be proved that as long as 
1 AH 1   + , (40)2 AL 2
then both high-skill and low-skill entrepreneurs prefer zero taxes, i.e., 
t = 0. 
Condition (40) requires the productivity gap between low and 
high-skill entrepreneurs not to be so large that low-skill entrepreneurs 
wish to tax prots in order to indirectly transfer resources from 
high-skill entrepreneurs to themselves. 
When condition (40) holds, the oligarchy will always choose t = 0.

Subgame Perfect Equilibria (continued) 
With this strategy prole, the elite will raise 
 (1  )(1)/Am m (16)(1  ) (1  ) 
if they set  today. 
If, in contrast, they deviate at any point, the most protable deviation 
for them is to set m = 1, and they will raise 
 (1  )(1)/Am m . (17)1   
The trigger-strategy prole will be an equilibrium as long as (16) is 
greater than or equal to (17), which requires   1  . Therefore: 
Proposition: Consider the holdup game, and suppose that Conditions 
(ES) hold and = 1. Then for   1  , there exists a subgame perfect 
equilibrium where m =  for all t.t

Technology Adoption and Holdup 
Suppose now that taxes are set before investments, so the source of 
holdup above is absent. 
Instead, suppose that at time t = 0 before any economic decisions or 
policy choices are made, middle class agents can invest to increase 
their productivity. 
There is a cost  (Am ) of investing in productivity Am . 
Once investments in technology are made, the game proceeds as 
before. 
Since investments in technology are sunk after date t = 0, the 
equilibrium allocations are the same as in the results presented above. 
Question: if they could, the elite would prefer to commit to a tax rate 
sequence at time t = 0.

Each agent therefore starts period t with two state variables: 
j
skill level at {AH , AL}
jst {0, 1} denoting whether the individual has an active rm. 
j
We refer to an agent with s= 1 as a member of the elite, since he t 
will have an advantage in becoming an entrepreneur (when there are 
entry barriers), and in an oligarchic society, he may be politically more 
inuential than non-elite agents.

          <text>Economic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions Technology Adoption and Holdup 
Technology Adoption: Revenue Extraction (continued) 
Proposition: Consider the game with technology adoption, and suppose 
that Condition (ES) holds and  &gt; 0, then the unique political equilibrium 
features m = RE  min {, } for all t. If the elite could commit to a t 
tax policy at time t = 0, they would prefer to commit to TA &lt; RE . 
Therefore, in contrast to the pure holdup problem where SPE could 
prevent the additional ine ciency (when   1  ), with the 
technology adoption game, the ine ciency survives the SPE. 
The reason is that, since middle class producers invest only once at 
the beginning, there is no possibility of using history-dependent 
punishment strategies. 
This illustrates the limits of implicit agreements to keep tax rates low. 
Such agreements not only require a high discount factor (  1  ), 
but also frequent investments by the middle class, so that there is a 
credible threat against the elite if they deviate from the promised 
policies.

Technology Adoption: Revenue Extraction (continued) 
To illustrate this, suppose that the elite can commit to a constant tax 
rate. 
Then, the optimization problem of the elite is to maximize tax 
revenues taking the relationship between taxes and technology as in 
(18) as given. In other words, they will solve: 
max m (1  m )(1)/Am m / (1  ) 
subject to (18). 
The rst-order condition for an interior solution can be expressed as

Revenue Extraction 
To highlight this mechanism, suppose that Condition (ES) holds, so 
wages are constant at zero. 
This removes any eect of taxation on factor prices. 
In this case, from (6), we also have lj 
t =  for all producers. 
Also assume that  &gt; 0 (for example,  = 1).

Technology Adoption: Revenue Extraction 
Let us next consider the pure revenue extraction case with Condition 
(ES) satised. 
Once again, the MPE is identical to before with 
m = RE  min {, }. 
As a result, the rst-order condition for an interior solution to the 
middle class producerstechnology choice is: 
0 (Am )= 1  (1  m )1/ . (18)1   1   
This is also the unique SPE, since no punishments are possible. 
But, if the elite could commit to a tax rate sequence at time t = 0, 
they would choose lower taxes in order to increase investment by the 
middle class and thus tax revenues.

Taxes are set after the investment decisions, which can be motivated 
by potential commitment problems whereby entrepreneurs can be 
held up after they make their investments decision. 
Once these investments are sunk, it is in the interest of the workers to 
tax and redistribute entrepreneurial income.

Conclusion 
Distributional conicts will lead to distortionary policies. 
The extent of distortions depends on whether groups in power wish to 
manipulate factor prices. 
Factor price manipulation could lead to higher taxes, insecure 
property rights, and barriers against technology adoption 
These equilibria not necessarily Pareto suboptimal the set of 
instruments is restricted. 
However, Pareto ine ciencies arise when there are nontrivial dynamic 
interactions (as in holdup or technology adoption) 
Also note that simply changing the identity of the group in power 
may not improve the allocation of resources as we discuss in greater 
detail next.

(MPE) the elite set the tax rate today without commitment to 
future tax rates (but in the baseline model we start with this is 
equivalent to choosing the entire future sequences of tax rates).

Comments 
(1  tj )1/Aj / (1  ) is the net marginal product of a worker 
employed by a producer of group j. 
If the wage is above this amount, this producer would not employ any 
workers, and if it is below, he or she would prefer to hire as many 
workers as possible (i.e., up to the maximum, ). 
Potential distortion: producers invest in physical capital but only 
jreceive a fraction (1  t ) of the revenues. 
Therefore, taxes discourage investments, creating potential 
ine ciencies 
But are these Pareto ine ciencies?

Democratic Equilibrium (continued) 
Proposition: A democratic equilibrium always features t =  and 
bt = 0. Moreover, we have ej = 1 if and only if aj = AH , so t = 1. The t t 
equilibrium wage rate is given by 
Dw= wD  (1  )1/AH , (38)t 1   
and the aggregate output is 
1 1 YD = YD  (1  )  AH . (39)t 1   
Aggregate output is constant over time 
Also perfect equality because the excess supply of high-skill 
entrepreneurs ensures that they receive no rents.

Other Systems? 
Can other political systems do better? 
Yes, for example, delegate taxes to entrepreneurs and entry barriers to 
workers 
But, generally not feasible. 
Political power indivisible : if the system is democratic, the party in 
power can also decides taxes.

Comparison between Democracy and Oligarchy 
First, as long as  &gt; 0, then 
1 1 1YD = ( 1  )  AH &lt; YE = AH .01   1   
Therefore, for all  &gt; 0, oligarchy initially generates greater output 
than democracy, because it is protecting the property rights of 
entrepreneurs. 
However, the analysis also shows that YE declines over time, while t 
YD is constant, the oligarchic economy may subsequently fall behind 
the democratic society. 
Whether it does so or not depends on whether YD is greater than YE 
 
as given by (43).

Subgame Versus Markov Perfect Equilibria 
What happens if you look at subgame perfect equilibria? 
Proposition: The MPEs characterized above are the unique SPEs. 
Why? Because unique best responses within each period, and no 
intertemporal linkages. 
More interestingly, this is because there is no political failure . 
All of the equilibria above (with the exception of political 
consolidation eect depending on details) are Pareto optimal .

          <text>Economic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions Technology Adoption and Holdup 
Technology Adoption: Factor Price Manipulation 
Proposition: Consider the game with technology adoption and suppose 
that Condition (ES) does not hold, and  = 0, then the unique MPE and 
= FPM   unique SPE feature m  for all t. Moreover, if the elite could t 
commit to a tax sequence at time t = 0, then they would still choose 
m = FPM  .t 
Intuition: this is the case of pure factor price manipulation, so the 
only objective of the elite is to reduce the middle classlabor demand. 
Therefore, they have no interest in increasing the productivity of 
middle class producers.

Factor Price Manipulation 
To highlight this mechanism in the simplest possible way, let us rst 
assume that  = 0 so that there are no direct benets from taxation 
for the elite. 
There are indirect benets, because of the eect of taxes on factor 
prices, which will be present as long as the equilibrium wage is 
positive. 
Suppose that Condition (ES) does not hold, so that equilibrium wage 
is given by (7). 
Therefore, choose taxes to minimize equilibrium wages.

Subgame Perfect Equilibria 
Now imagine trigger-strategy equilibria. 
Suppose that Condition (ES) holds and  &gt; 0, so that most preferred 
tax rate for the elite is m = . 
Suppose also that = 1. 
Consider the strategy prole where the elite set m =  at each date 
and the middle class choose investment levels according to this tax 
rate. 
If the elite ever set a higher tax rate, then the middle class expect 
m = 1 in all future dates, and choose zero production.

          <text>Economic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions Oligarchy versus Democracy 
Comparison between Democracy and Oligarchy (continued) 
Proposition: Suppose that condition (40) holds. Then at t = 0, 
aggregate output is higher in an oligarchic society than in a democratic 
society, i.e., YE &gt; YD . If (44) does not hold, then aggregate output in 0 
oligarchy is always higher than in democracy, i.e., YE &gt; YD for all t. Ift 
(44) holds, then there exists t0 N such that for t  t0 , YE  YD and for t 
t &gt; t0 , YE &lt; YD , so that the democratic society leapfrogs the oligarchic t 
society. Leapfrogging is more likely when , AL /AH and M are low. 
Oligarchies are more likely to be relatively ine cient in the long run: 
when  is low, meaning that democracy is unable to pursue highly 
populist policies 
when AH is high relative to AL, so that high-skill comparative 
advantage is important 
M is low, so that a random selection of agents contains a small fraction 
of high-skill agents, making oligarchic sclerosis highly distortionary.

Democratic Equilibrium 
In democracy, policies made by majoritarian voting. 
In MPE, after investments are made, the median voter, a worker, 
wishes through distribute as much as possible, thus 
t = . 
Moreover, entry barriers reduce wages (from (32)), thus 
bt = 0. 
Than in equilibrium: 
wD + TD

Dwhere wis the equilibrium wage in democracy, and TD is the level 
of transfers, given by YD .

Simple Model of Elite Control 
Innite horizon economy populated by a continuum 1 of risk neutral

Unique non-storable nal good denoted by y. 
The expected utility of agent j at time 0 is given by:

Suppose that each individual dies with a small probability  in every 
period, and a mass  of new individuals are born (with the convention 
that after death there is zero utility and  is the discount factor 
inclusive of the probability of death). 
We will consider the limit of this economy with   0.

\Partisan Control, Media Bias, and Viewer Response"
Setting: Italy.
Three state channels: RAI1, RAI2, and RAI3, plus three
Berlusconi-owned private stations
During this decade: RAI2 is always center-right, RAI3 is always left,
but RAI1 (most popular) switches depending on who is in power
Question: when RAI1 switches due to political control, do viewers

23A further argument is that the extent of required regulation of television is higher because
of difculties in dening property rights for broadcasting frequencies. It may be optimal from
an efciency standpoint for the state to control television stations directly as opposed toregulating the sector and spending resources in monitoring compliance. These arguments havebeen disputed by R. H. Coase, The Federal Communications Commission, 2 J.

Prediction: those endorsements that are surprises { i.e., contrary to

Approach:
Use daily tracking poll data to identify the impact of the endorsement

For each newspaper, calculate predicted probability of endorsing a
Democrat or Republican based on the newspaper's owner and the
demographics of the newspaper's readership.
Alternative approach: calculate historical endorsement probabilities.

Collective Choices: Introduction 
One happy settlement of the questions of political economy would be 
to show that there is a natural and perhaps even e cient way of 
resolving conicts. 
For example, one could imagine a set of aggregation rules that would 
take the conicting preferences of the members of a group and arrive 
to a mutually agreeable collective decision. 
Unfortunately, as we will next see this is not possible. 
This is the essence of Arrow s Impossibility Theorem, which has two 
key implications: 
Conict will not have an easy solution.

Proof of the Median Voter Theorem with Strategic Voting 
The vote counting rule (the political system) in this case is 
majoritarian, denoted by VM . 
0Consider two policies p, p00 P and x an individual i H. 
00; i ). Assume without loss of any generality that U (p0; i )  U (p
Suppose rst that for any vi {p0 , p00}, VM (vi , vi (p0 , p00)) = p0 or 
0VM (vi , vi (p, p00)) = p00, that is, individual i is not pivotal. 
0 00)= p This implies that vi (p, p0 is a best response for individual i. 
Suppose next that individual i is pivotal, that is, 
0 00) , vi (p0 00)) = 0 00)= p VM (vi (p, p , p p0 if vi (p, p0 and 
0 00) , vi (p0VM (vi (p, p , p00)) = p00 otherwise. In this case, the action 
0 00)= p vi (p, p0 is clearly a best response for i. 
Since this argument applies for each i H, it establishes that voting 
sincerely is a weakly-dominant strategy and the conclusion of the 
theorem follows.

Proof of the Median Voter Theorem 
The proof is by a separation argument . 
Order the individuals according to their bliss points p(i ), and label 
the median-ranked bliss point by pm . 
By the assumption that H is an odd number, pm is uniquely dened 
(though m may not be uniquely dened). 
Suppose that there is a vote between pm and some other policy 
00 &lt; pm . p
By denition of single-peaked preferences, for every individual with 
00; i ). pm &lt; p(i ), we have U (pm ; i ) &gt; U (p
By A2, these individuals will vote sincerely and thus, in favor of pm . 
The coalition voting for supporting pm thus constitutes a majority.

Probablilistic Voting Equilibrium 
Focus rst on pure strategy symmetric equilibria. Clearly in this case, 
we will have policy convergence with pA = pB = p , and thus 
Ug (pA ) = Ug (pB ). 
Consequently, symmetric equilibrium policies, announced by both 
parties, must be given by 
G

g =1 
Therefore, the probability quoting equilibrium is given as the solution 
to the maximization of the following weighted utilitarian social welfare 
function:

g =1 
where g  hg (0) are the weights that dierent groups receive in the

Arrow s Impossibility Theorem 
Theorem 
( Arrow s (Im)Possibility Theorem) If a social ordering, , is transitive, 
weakly Paretian and satises independence from irrelevant alternatives, 
then it is dictatorial. 
An immediate implication of this theorem is that any set of minimal 
decisive individuals D within the society H must either be a 
singleton, that is, D = {i}, so that we have a dictatorial social 
ordering, or we have to live with intransitivities. 
Also implicitly, political power must matter. If we wish transitivity, 
political power must be allocated to one individual or a set of 
individuals with the same preferences. 
How do we proceed? Restrict preferences or restrict institutions.

Weighted Social Welfare Functions 
Theorem 
(Probabilistic Voting Theorem) Consider a set of policy choices P, let 
p P RK be a policy vector and let preferences be given by (4), with 
the distribution function of g as Hg. Then, if a pure strategy symmetric i 
equilibrium exists, equilibrium policy is given by p that maximizes (8). 
Most important: probabilistic voting equilibria are Pareto optimal 
(given policy instruments). 
Now in fact, looking back, whenever the Median Voter Theorem 
applies, the equilibrium is again Pareto optimal.

Introduction 
Much of economics takes preferences, technology and institutions 
(market structure, laws, regulations, policies) as given. 
Thus institutions matter in the same way as preferences do.

Institutions are not just about laws, but more generally about how 
collective choices are made and conicting preferences (and 
dierential information) are aggregated. 
Political economy is about systematically investigating this type of 
aggregation and resolution of conicts.

Proof 
The proof works with exactly the same separation argument as in the 
proof of Theorem 4. 
Consider the median voter with m , and bliss policy pm . 
Consider an alternative policy p0 &gt; pm . Naturally, 
U(pm ; m ) &gt; U(p0; m ). 
Then, by the single crossing property, for all i &gt; m , 
U(pm ; i ) &gt; U(p0; i ). 
Since m is the median, this implies that there is a majority in favor 
of pm . 
The same argument for p0 &lt; pm completes the proof

Application: Redistributive Taxation V 
This is the foundation of the general presumption that greater 
inequality (which is generally, but not always, associated with a 
widening gap between the mean and the median) will lead to greater 
taxation to ensure greater redistribution away from the mean towards 
the median. 
Notice also that greater inequality in this model leads to greater 
ine ciency of policy. 
Why is this? The reason is only weakly related to the logic of 
redistribution, but more to the technical assumptions that have been 
made. 
In order to obtain single-peaked preferences, we had to restrict policy 
to a single dimensional object, the linear tax rate.

Probablilistic Voting: Main Idea 
In the above example, it appears that the discontinuity of best 
responses in policies is important in nonexistence. 
The main idea of probabilistic voting is to smooth best responses in 
order to get existence. 
Intuitively, there are ideological and non-policy factors, so that a small 
advantage due to policies will not sway all voters.

Inequality and Redistribution 
One of the key conclusions mentioned above is that greater inequality 
should lead to greater redistribution. 
Despite these claims in the literature, however, there is no such 
unambiguous prediction. 
More importantly, there is no empirical evidence that greater 
inequality leads to more distribution. 
In fact, why many highly unequal societies do not adopt more 
redistributive policies will be one of the teams we will investigate 
when we come to understanding the nature of institutions

Single Crossing 
More useful: 
Denition 
Consider an ordered policy space P and also order voters according to 
their i  s. Then, the preferences of voters satisfy the single-crossing 
property over the policy space P when the following statement is true: 
if p &gt; p0 and i 0 &gt; i , or if p &lt; p0 and i 0 &lt; i , then 
0 0U(p; i ) &gt; U(p; i ) implies that U(p; i 0 ) &gt; U(p; i 0 ). 
Notice that while single peakedness is a property of preferences only, 
the single-crossing property refers to a set of preferences over a given 
policy space P. It is therefore a joint property of preferences and 
choices.

A middle class agent is the median voter, and decides the linear tax

Proof of Arrow s Impossibility Theorem IV 
Step 2: Given the result in Step 1, if we prove that some individual 
h H is strongly decisive for some p1, p2 P, we will have 
established that it is a dictator and thus  is dictatorial. Let Dab be 
the strongly decisive set between pa and pb . 
Such a set always exists for any pa, pb P, since H itself is a 
strongly decisive set. Let D be the minimal strongly decisive set 
(meaning the strongly decisive set with the fewest members). 
This is also well-dened, since there is only a nite number of 
individuals in H. 
Moreover, without loss of generality, suppose that D = D12 (i.e., let 
the strongly decisive set between p1 and p2 be the minimal strongly 
decisive set). 
If D a singleton, then Step 1 applies and implies that  is dictatorial, 
completing the proof.

Existence of Pure Strategy Equilibria 
However, the probability voting model is not always used properly. 
It is a good model to represent certain political interactions. 
But it is not a good model to ensure pure strategy equilibria. 
In fact, pure strategy existence requires that the matrices

Assume that i is distributed in the population with mean  and 
median m . 
Since individual preferences are linear in consumption, optimal labor 
supply satises 
li = L() + (i  ), 
1where L()    (h0)(1  ) is decreasing in  by the concavity 
of h(). 
A higher tax rate on labor income distorts the labor-leisure choice and 
induces the consumer to work less. This will be the cost of 
redistributive taxation in this model. 
Let l denote average labor supply. Since the average of i is , we 
have l = L(). The government budget constraint can therefore be 
written: 
T  l  L().

Application: Redistributive Taxation III 
Let U(; i ) be utility for i from tax  with T determined as 
residual. By straightforward substitution into the individual utility 
function, we can express the policy preferences of individual i as 
U(; i )  L() + h(  L()) + (1  )(i  ). (1) 
Are the preferences represented by (1) single-peaked? 
The answer depends on the shape of the average labor supply 
function L(). By putting enough structure on dysfunction, we could 
ensure that U(; i ) is strictly concave or quasi concave, thus 
satisfying single-peakedness. However, this function could be 
su ciently convex that U(; i ) could have multiple peaks (multiple 
local maxima). As a result, preferences may not be single peaked. 
But it is straightforward to verify that (1) satises the single-crossing 
property.

(The Median Voter Theorem With Strategic Voting) Suppose that H

single-peaked policy preferences over a given ordering of policy

each player and there exists a unique weakly-dominant equilibrium, which 
features the median-ranked bliss point, pm, as the Condorcet winner. 
Notice no more open agenda . Why not? 
Why emphasis on weakly-dominant strategies?

works (Column 8). Columns 2 and 6 interact connectedness with a reform dummy that is 1 after 1930. Connected
is a dummy that is 1 if the governor is connected to the Secretary of State. Time-varying controls comprise the
number of colonies the governor has served in. Spell length FEs are dummies for each year of the term. Standard
errors in parentheses, clustered at the dyadic governor-secretary of state level. * p&lt;0.1, **p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.01.

          <text>Experiment
KKO work with the same tax property tax inspectors.
Provide incentives as follows, though a Performance-Ranked Serial
Dictatorship :
Rank inspectors based on performance (growth in tax revenue)
Inspectors then take turn, in performance-rank order, picking their slots
Incentives arise from desire to get higher rank
Note though that government loses control over allocation of
inspectors. Good or bad?
Implement this as a randomized trial.
Randomize entire groups of inspectors into scheme or not
Repeat for two years, rerandomizing after year 1. Why?

          <text>Patronage and Selection of Bureaucrats
If bureaucrat quality matters, then if you can select better
bureaucrats you can improve performance
However, politicians often control hiring of bureaucrats { and do it
more for political reasons than to maximize quality. This is called
patronage.
The reasons this is bad are obvious. But why might it be good?
\Patronage serves the public interest by facilitating the
implementing of policies endorsed by the electorate." - Supreme
Court Justice Stewart, 1980.
How to investigate this?

The results 
of the placebo test are reported in Table 5. Column  1 reproduces the 
baseline reduced-form estimate from column 6 of Table 2 for comparison. The esti-
mates in columns 211 show that the coef
ficients for the placebo crops are all close 
to zero. Unlike wheat, for no other crop do we estimate a positive and statistically significant relationship between the constructed instrument and conflict.
28 Overall, 
the estimates provide confirmation of the validity of our estimation strategy.
The second test checks that our first-stage estimates are not confounded by spu-
rious positive trends between US wheat production and food aid shipments to US food aid recipients. We estimate alternative first-stage equations where the instru-ment is used to predict past food aid rather than future food aid. As reported in online Appendix Table A4, we find no relationship between our instrument and past 
27 Production data are from FAOs ProdSTAT database.
28 To compare the magnitudes of the coefficients, we also report standardized beta coefficients (since the produc-
tion of different commodities occurs on very different scales).Table 5Reduced-Form Estimates of the Effect of Placebo Instruments on Civil Conflict

Nunn and Qian (2014): "US Food Aid and Civil Con&#13;ict"
Empirical idea:
The US food aid system is part of a system to keep farm prices high in
the US
So when there is a good wheat crop in the US, the government buys
extra wheat and gives it out as aid
Tends to give it out to the same countries
So...
They look at whether good US wheat harvests lead to more or less
con&#13;ict in countries that tend to receive aid
Idea is that this is occurring through the aid channel
Thoughts on empirics?
How does this relate to Dube and Vargas?

5We control for year and location (subcounty) of birth with dummy
variables for year and location, as well as year and location interactions.
Also included are quartic terms for each pretreatment household charac-teristic. Matching estimates match one-for-one exactly on location andfour-year age intervals, followed by matching on specic age.
6Results are robust to the removal of the selection-correction weights;
the further exclusion of prewar household characteristics, the removal ofattrition-correction weights, and the exclusion of the age and location
dummy variables (a simple difference of means between treatment and
control groups). The results are also robust to the use of a nonparametricmatching estimator.
7This literacy ATE seems large given the ATE in schooling. In local
primary schools, however, pupils learn to read only by their sixth orseventh year of school, and losing these crucial years dramatically
increases illiteracy. For instance, looking at all youth in the sample, mov-
ing from 6 to 7 years of schooling is associated with a 22 percentage pointincrease in literacy.8Wages are not observed for 237 unemployed youth (and log wages are
undened for 56 males with zero earnings). If abduction is associatedwith the propensity to be employed or earn nothing, we will conate thedirect impact of abduction on wages with the indirect effects on the type
of people employed (Heckman, 1979; Lee, 2005). Since abduction is
uncorrelated with employment and the likelihood of zero earnings, suchsample selection bias is likely immaterial.

of US wheat aid on total wheat aid provision (from all countries). If US wheat aid 
is crowding out wheat aid from other countries, then a one-unit (i.e., 1,000  MT) 
increase in US wheat aid will increase total food aid by less than 1,000  MT. Column  1 
of Table 9 reports the point estimate, which 
is 1.23 and statistically significant. The 
point estimate, which is close to one, suggests that US aid does not crowd out the provision of wheat aid from other countries. Column 2 estimates the same regres-sion but with cereal aid from all countries, rather than wheat aid as the dependent variable. The point estimate again shows that US wheat aid does not crowd out food aid from other countries. The lack of crowd-out for both wheat and cereal aid is confirmed by the estimates reported in columns 3 and 4, which show that US wheat aid has no effect on the provision of wheat aid and cereal aid from non-US donor countries. The point estimates are small, positive, and statistically insignificant.
We next turn to the possibility that US food aid crowds out the provision of other 
types of US aid, such as military aid or economic aid ( net of food) . Columns 5 and 6 
show that US food aid does not crowd out these other types of aid. In fact, for military Table 8The Effect of Food Aid on Small- and Large-Scale Conflicts

          <text>Fearon (1995): Reasons for wars
Irrationalities
Divergent interests between leaders and citizens
\Rational reasons"
Private information, e.g., about other's willingness to go to war, or
problems communicating that information (truthfully)
Example: N. Korea underestimated U.S. willingness to defend S. Korea
Commitment problems
Example: 1939 Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union over
tiny islands; Finns worried Stalin would push for more if they conceded
Indivisibilities
Example: Only one prince can assume the throne !Franco-Prussian
War
There are models of these various explanations; we will focus on a
model of commitment problems + misaligned incentives between
leaders and citizens

          <text>Analysis
Special case of transfers without commitment (Proposition 4)
wIf probability of winning is proportional to relative wealth (p =j),wj+wi
then with no bias there will be no war, even without commitment
With other probability functions, if you lose either unbiasedness or
commitment, you can get war
Endogenous bias
With no transfers, everyone prefers unbiased leader, because the leader
maximizes the same object as the population
With transfers, citizens might prefer a biased leader if it induces more
transfers from the other side
Interesting hypothesis to investigate

Denition 
LAn MPE of the simple legislature is a vector of policies pt (btL ) and a 
vector of reservation utilities bL such that in any period t (1) for any given t 
LbL, at least one legislator l 6= a prefers pt (btL) to the default outcome; (2) t 
Lfor any given bL, the agenda setter a prefers pt (btL ) to any other policy t 
satisfying (1); (3) the reservation utilities bL are optimal for the voters in t 
each district, taking into account that policies are chosen according to 
Lpt (btL ) and taking the identities of the legislators and the other biL ast 
given.

Let bt be the vector of reservation utilities. Note that since this part 
of the stage game takes place after nature has determined who is the

          <text>Economic Policy under Representative Democracy Review of Bargaining Theory 
Bargaining: Overview 
How do economists think about bargaining? 
Cooperative game theory approach: 
Primitives are set of outcomes players can attain if come to 
agreement, and disagreement point that results if fail to agree. 
Impose axioms that (allegedly) any reasonable solution should 
satisfy: e ciency, symmetry, IIA, etc. 
Prominent solutions: Nash bargaining solution, Shapley value, etc. 
Non-cooperative game theory approach: 
Primitive is an extensive-form game, or bargaining protocol . Ex. 
alternating oers, with discounting between rounds. 
Analyze by nding (subgame perfect, sequential, etc.) equilibrium. 
Most famous model: Rubinstein (1982) 
Baron and Ferejohn s model of legislative bargaining is a version of 
n-player Rubinstein bargaining adapted to majority rule.

          <text>Economic Policy under Representative Democracy The Eects of Political Institutions 
Parliamentary Democracy: Argument 
The argument is similar. 
First note that if one of the governing coalition vetoes the initial 
proposal the legislators play the simple legislative bargaining model 
that we began with. 
This game has the same solution to the previous one and this will pin 
down the lowest possible payo that the agenda setter can oer the 
junior partner. 
With some probability the junior partner can be chosen as agenda 
setter a0, etc.

Other Equilibria: Proof (continued) 
When do such M (y ) and z (y ) exist for all y? 
That is, when is it true that, for any y, there is some majority that 
prefers some z (y ) tomorrow to y today? 
Hardest deviation y to defeat: give 1/ (n  1) to every other player. 
(Intuition: if gave someone less, they d be more willing to join 
majority against you.) 
When is there a majority that prefers sharing the whole dollar among 
themselves tomorrow to getting 1/ (n  1) each today? 
Answer: this is the case i 
n + 1   2 (n  1) 
= if   n+1 , then such M (y ) and z (y ) always exist, so any 2(n1) 
split can occur in SPE.

          <text>Economic Policy under Representative Democracy The Eects of Political Institutions 
Simple Legislature: Intuition 
Public goods are undersupplied because the Bertrand competition 
between the non-agenda setter groups means that the agenda setter 
only has to please voters in his own group. 
Thus he ignores the benets to the other groups of providing public 
goods, while internalizing the full cost. 
The same logic implies that only voters in this group get 
redistribution. 
Finally the two legislators in the winning coalition get rents because 
citizens cannot punish them hard enough. 
As in e ciency wage models, when the stick is too small, the carrot 
has to be used and citizens have to concede rents to politicians to 
stop them deviating and grabbing all of the tax revenues.

Simple Legislature: Argument 
Equilibrium characterized by backward induction. 
After the agenda setter has been chosen and the re-election rules 
determined, legislative bargaining takes place. In this game the 
agenda setter aims to form a minimum winning coalition and thus 
wants to design a policy such that one other group supports it. 
The agenda setter makes a take-it-or leave it oer to the other 
legislator who is easiest to buy, where the price will be in terms of 
what the agenda setter has to oer the politician to get them to say 
yes. 
In turn this will be determined by what that legislator has to deliver 
to his voters to get re-elected.

The Eects of Political Institutions 
So far we examined models of democracy with few institutional 
details. 
But some of these details matter (and we have seen a preview of that 
in legislative bargaining). 
One set of important institutional arrangements that matter for how 
democracy works are about separation of powers  the distribution 
of powers between legislatures and presidents (and beyond). 
We now discuss a very simple model of this due to Persson, Tabellini 
and Roland (1997, 2000).

President versus Congress: Argument (continued) 
Using the government budget constraint incentive compatibility 
entails 
g + r  2W . (6) 
As before, Bertrand competition between the non-agenda setter 
groups implies that they get no transfers. 
Thus the optimal allocation from the point of view of voters in the 
group with the agenda setter maximizes r + H(g ) subject to (6). 
This gives g = min[g , 2W ], r = 2W  g, and s = 3  2W . 
Now move back to the taxation decision noting that a 6= ag . 
Note that the voters in the group of agenda setter a will not benet 
from high taxes since these will be allocated by a dierent legislator 
subsequently. 
Nevertheless, the re-election rule has to allow taxes to be su ciently 
high to avoid a deviating. Indeed we now show that C  1  W .

Rubinstein (continued) 
Theorem 
1Rubinstein bargaining has a unique SPE: the proposer demands 1+ , and 
the responder accepts oers of at least 1+ . 
Proposer gets more than responder. 
As   1, proposer and responder each get about half the surplus. 
Proof of existence: 
1Proposer can t get more than 1+ today, and waiting to become 
responder (or later proposer) is worse. 
1If responder rejects, gets 1+ as proposer tomorrow. Given 
discounting, she should accept oers of at least 1+ .

What does this all mean? 
Public goods are underprovided relative to the Lindahl-Samuelson rule 
which here is 3H0(g ) = 1. 
Taxes are maximal, though note that there are no distortions 
associated with taxation in this model. 
We have sL &gt; 0 so that the politicians get rents. 
Finally, the constituents of the agenda setter benet by getting 
transfers baL &gt; 0, while no other group does so.

Now let s introduce the president, so that we come closer to the

We will compare this institutional structure to the simple legislature. 
We will then introduce a dierent extensive form game with Persson,

features of a parliamentary system, and compared this one to the

Simple Legislature (continued) 
The idea is that incumbents are accountable to their district and that 
voters within districts coordinate their voting strategies and set a 
particular reservation utility level of utility such that if they get this 
level of utility they re-elect the incumbent. 
If not they replace him with an alternative politician who is identical 
(there are a large number of these). 
Crucially however, voters in dierent groups choose their re-election 
strategies non-cooperatively with respect to the other groups.

Parliamentary Democracy: Argument (continued) 
This continuation game also pins down the sP (total rents) that 
voters have to concede to the politicians. 
Now moving backward the key observation is that since the voters in 
the two groups that form the governing coalition simultaneously 
choose their reservation utility levels, there are multiple (a 
continuum) of Nash equilibria. 
Put dierently, there are lots of pairs of (ba , bm ) which are mutual 
best responses and which will map into dierent distributions of 
(ra , rm ) between the coalition partners.

Timing of Events: Discussion 
The emphasis here is on the idea that a parliamentary government 
can fail if it looses a vote of condence. 
Voting in Parliament is not sequential so that the model does not 
have the checks and balances and none of the separation of powers 
inherent in the previous game. 
If a government crisis occurs this wipes away the entire proposal, 
whereas before if an allocation of expenditure was defeated this did 
not undo the tax rate previously determined.

Parliamentary Democracy: Argument (continued) 
The key observation is that in this model there is not a Bertrand 
game between the members of the government, so when g is chosen 
it will internalize the utility of both members of the coalition, hence 
the condition 2H0(g) = 1. 
Relative to the previous models this means that the supply of public 
goods will be larger. 
Hence also the fact that two groups of voters get transfers, rather 
than one as in the previous two models. 
However, since taxation and expenditure decisions are not decoupled 
now. 
This implies that the members of the governing coalition are residual 
claimants on taxation and wish to set  = 1 (to extract as many 
resources a possible from the third group). 
Note that since rents to politicians are pinned down by the simple 
legislature, they are the same as in the rst model.

Note rst that with probability one half, a will be in the winning 
coalition when expenditure is decided. a will not deviate from a tax 
proposal if 
sm 
d+ W  v2 
where vd is the deviation utility from some other tax proposal. The 
highest deviation payo that a could get would be by setting d = 1 
since if he deviates then the players get the status quo payos sl = . 
Since a is in the winning coalition with probability 1/2, the highest 
dvis 1/2. 
Thus an incentive compatible C must satisfy

Proof of uniqueness: 
Fix a SPE. 
Let M and m be the supremum and inmum of a responder s 
continuation payo after rejects. 
A proposer can always get at least 1  M, so m   (1  M) . 
A proposer can never get more than 1  m, so M   (1  m) . 
Combining these inequalities gives m   (1   + m), or m  1+ . 
Similarly, M  1+ .

Questions about Legislative Decision-Making 
What coalitions form? 
What policy/redistribution of benets results? 
How do procedural rules aect outcomes? 
Much of the analysis of these questions in political science and 
political economy is based on the classic paper by Baron and Ferejohn 
(1989). 
We will focus on this paper, and also discuss recent work by Ali, 
Bernheim, and Fan (2014).

Other Equilibria: Proof 
Consider strategy prole of following form: 
Proposer always proposes x. 
Responders vote yes. 
If proposer i deviates by proposing y, then: 
A majority M (y ) rejects y. 
Restart the strategy prole with x replaced by some z (y ) that gives 0 
to proposer i and is better than y / for everyone in M (y ). 
If such M (y ) and z (y ) always exist, then this is a SPE: 
Proposer gets 0 if deviates. 
Responder just causes delay if deviates by rejecting. 
Members of M (y ) make themselves worse-o if vote to accept y.

Then C s vote must cost at least . 
C s vote costs at least  i B gives her at least / in period 1 with 
positive probability. 
Then A s vote must also cost at least / in period 1. 
But A s vote costs at least / in period 1 i C gives her at least 
/2 in period 2 with positive probability. 
By induction someone s vote costs at least /t in period t with 
positive probability, for all t.

Simple Legislature 
Let s begin the analysis with what PRT call a simple legislature just 
to see how the model works. 
With this institutional structure, each region i elects one legislator 
and separate elections take place under plurality rule in each district. 
In period j each incumbent legislator has preferences 
tj lDlst t 
t=j 
so that they get utility only from rents. Dl = 1 if such a legislator is t 
in power in period t. If out of o ce a legislator gets zero utility and a 
legislator who is voted out of o ce is never re-elected.

Simple Legislature: Argument (continued) 
Now consider whether or not a wishes to be re-appointed. 
Alternatively, he can propose a pt which will get him thrown out of 
o ce (subject to the constraint that one other legislator has to agree 
to it). The best such pt involves g = r = 0 and  = 1. Here m gets 
sm but a provides no public goods or transfers and sets sa as high as 
possible. 
To avoid this, we require 
as+ W  3   (3) 
where the deviation payo is 3 (sa=total tax revenue) minus the 
payment to m to get agreement. 
Combining (2) and (3) we see that a and m will choose a policy 
leading to re-election if and only if 
a ms  s+ s+ 2W  3 (4) 
as claimed. When this is satised all three legislators are re-elected.

Predictability and Power in Legislative Bargaining 
Ali-Bernheim-Fan (2014) investigate role of assumption that 
bargaining power in Baron-Ferejohn is unpredictable, in that 
proposer randomly chosen each period. 
In reality, who gets to propose legislation is not random, instead 
determined by predictable things like: 
Rules that specify that everyone gets a turn to propose. 
Seniority rules about who makes proposals. 
Political maneuvers by a chair who nominates a proposer. 
Question: does it matter?

Model: Politicians 
There are three politicians, one representing each of the groups. 
Politicians enjoy politician-specic transfers denote by sl (how much t 
rent each gets to steal). 
A policy vector is thus denoted 
i lpt = [t , gt , {rt }, {st }] 
In each period the political system has to determine pt - the tax on 
incomes, public good provision, transfers, and politician rents. This is 
done subject to the government budget constraint

Compared to the simple legislature, taxes are lower as are rents. 
However, public goods are even further from the optimal level. 
Transfers are again concentrated to one specic group, here that 
represented by ag . 
Here the separation of powers element allows the voters to restrict the 
amount of rents that the politicians can extract and also reduces 
taxes because taxes are set by one agent but allocated by another.

          <text>Economic Policy under Representative Democracy Introduction 
Introduction 
As we have already seen, economic policy in representative 
(non-direct) democracy is not made by citizens voting over policy 
proposals, but by policymakers who have been elected to o ce. 
How does this generate policy? 
In the case of the simplest political agency models, the elected 
politician chooses policy subject to concerns about keeping his o ce. 
In general, however, there isn t a single politician, but a legislature, 
which may also be interacting with a president, other chambers and 
the bureaucracy. 
In this lecture, we focus on two (of many) approaches to 
policy-making in representative democracy (though also discussed 
some alternatives in passing):

2 Legislative bargaining.

Simple Legislature: Argument (continued) 
First observe that the legislative bargaining game must have the 
outcome rm = rn = 0 for m, n 6= a. 
To buy a legislator s vote, a must make transfers to his district. If bm , 
say, is set very high, then group m will be costly to buy for a and will 
be excluded from the winning coalition. 
Exclusion means no transfers for the district. 
This situation creates a Bertrand game between districts m, n 6= a 
and imply that they underbid each other until 
bm = bn = 1   + H(g ) and rm = rn = 0.

Stationary Reservation-Share Equilibria 
Natural class of equilibria is stationary reservation-share equilibrium, 
where each player i has a history-independent reservation share mi 
such that votes yes i oered at least mi . 
This would be Markovian with a careful denition of what the state 
variables are. 
Theorem 
Baron-Ferejohn bargaining has a unique stationary reservation-share 
equilibrium: the proposer oers /n to each of (n  1) /2 responders 
chosen at random, and a responder votes yes i she s oered at least /n. 
n1Proposer payo is 1   . For large n and , proposer gets about 2 n 
half of the surplus. About half of the responders split the other half 
of the surplus equally among themselves.

Predictability and Power in Legislative Bargaining 
For result that any split can occur in SPE, predictability doesn t 
matter. 
Same proof works if proposal power rotates in xed order, rather than 
random proposer. 
These authors focus on MPE (same strategies in indistinguishable 
information sets). Now predictability matters a lot: 
Theorem 
Suppose that in each period there is a majority of voters who are certain 
not to be the next proposer. Then in every MPE the current proposer gets 
the entire surplus. 
To guarantee equitable division of rents among legislators, it is not 
enough that get to propose equally often. You also need 
unpredictability, to prevent the current proposer from targeting 
weaker members.

Recap 
These models show how political economy can be applied to core 
public nance questions. 
Importantly, they emphasize how institutional details of democracy 
matter, and may matter a great deal. 
But the models are rather ddly and perhaps it is in the nature of 
the beast that details of functional forms and other things matter as 
much as institutional details. 
What do the data say? This will be discussed in the recitation.

Now if C = 1  W is high enough to nance the maximum amount 
of incentive compatible public goods, the optimal voting rule for 
citizens of the group of a would be to make him propose this C . 
This will be supported by the third legislator (not ag ). 
This essentially establishes the result.

Conclusion 
The empirical literature provides some evidence that politician 
behavior and eort respond to the election incentives and that voters, 
deliberately or otherwise, provide such incentives. 
But this evidence does not imply that incentives work well. 
In the next lecture we will see that under some conditions they work 
very badly.

Control of Politicians: Overview 
Model of politicians moral hazard 
Current leader has power today, so can decide the allocation of 
resources (limited ability of citizens to control that in a representative 
democracy). 
But citizens can kick this politician out in the next election. 
This is the model considered by Barro (1973) and Ferejohn (1986). 
Main idea: provide just enough rents to the politician so that the 
threat of being kicked out, he/she doesn t misbehave too badly.

          <text>Political Agency and Electoral Control Evidence 
Evidence 
Several pieces of evidence in the literature point to the existence of 
political agency type considerations. 
In particular, politicians behave dierently depending on how much 
rents they expect from remaining in o ce, and voters to kick out 
politicians who (badly) misbehave. 
Let us now go over a few papers illustrating this.

Best Equilibrium 
There is a simple equilibrium that always gives citizens their best 
possible payo (a best SPE): 
Politician is required to provide public goods at least 
 
g = min { (R + y ) , y }. (Reelected i he/she does this). 
Politician provides exactly this much. 
In stationary equilibrium of this form, politician IC constraint is: 
1  )  R + y (R + y  g1   
or equivalently 
 g   (R + y ) , 
which is satised, and thus we have characterized a best SPE for the 
citizens, with their utility given by 
1 min { (R + y ) , y } .1   
The IC constraint ensures that politicians receives enough rents.

Introduction 
So far the models and conceptual ideas we have discussed lacked the 
key feature of representative democracies  delegation of policies to 
elected politicians. 
But then How to ensure that politicians implement policies consistent 
with voter preferences? 
Barro-Ferejohn model: elections as a politician control device. 
Voters vote politicians who do not perform out of o ce. 
Loosely speaking, politicians as agents and voters as principals .

Career Concerns (continued) 
The rst-order condition of this maximization problems gives 
(y  r1)1  (R + r) = 0 (1)(y  r1)2 
This denes a best-response r1 (r1 ) by the incumbent. When voters 
expect them to play r1, he would play r1 (r1). 
Clearly, the equilibrium has to be a xed point, r1 (r1)= r1. 
Substituting this into (1), we obtain 
r1 = y  (R + r) 
and the politician keeps power with probability pI = 1 , since in 2 
equilibrium nobody s fooled, and with probability 1/2 the politician is 
worse than average.

Non-Stationary Equilibria 
Ferejohn only considers stationary equilibria, but non-stationary 
equilibria could be better. 
This is for two reasons: 
1 Productive e ciency: e cient to provide more public goods when  
lower. 
For example, society can expect the politician to deliver high public 
goods in some periods, but then lower levels at some future date. 
2 Backloading: e cient to give politicians rents tomorrow rather than 
today, as this relaxes his incentive constraint in both periods. 
We will see how backloading works in the context of optimal 
nonstationary equilibria next.

Upper Bound on CitizensPayo 
Incumbent can always grab entire output today and then (at the 
worst) get red. This guarantees payo of 
R + y 
Given that this much rent must be left to politician, an upper bound 
on citizenspayo is 
1 (R + y )  (R + y )1   
 = (R + y )1   
1Another upper bound is total output 1 y. 
So overall upper bound on citizenspayos is

Electoral Controls with Career Concerns 
A major shortcoming of the previous models is that if replacing 
politicians is costly, then these equilibria might unravel. 
Why? 
This is partly because voters do not think that they are replacing the 
current politician with a better one. 
One way of overcoming this problem is to look at a dierent type of 
agency models, inspired by Holmstrom s career concerns model. 
The main idea is that there is a feature of the politician, like ability, 
that voters care about, which also aects outcomes. 
Then, forward-looking voters look at past performance to estimate 
the ability and thus the electability of the politician.

Stationary Equilibrium 
Restrict attention to stationary equilibria: politician reelected i g is 
above some g . 
Note, however, that nonstationary strategies may do better now. 
Letting V be politician s continuation value, politician will provide 
exactly g units of public good if 
 g  V , 
and will steal all output otherwise (and get red). 
Politician provides public good i 
V     = g  
 
g too low = few public goods even when they re provided. 
 
g too high = politician rarely provides public goods.

Career Concerns (continued) 
The important simplifying assumption of the Holmstrom model, 
which we adopt here, is that there is symmetric information, so the 
politician is also uncertain about  with the same prior. 
The utility of the politician is 
I = r1 + pI (R + r2), 
with 0 &lt;  &lt; 1 again as the discount factor, pI is the endogenous 
probability of remaining in power, and now R is interpreted as 
non-pecuniary rents from being in power. 
The exact timing of events is as follows: 
Nature determines . 
The politician chooses r1. 
Observing g1 (but not r1), voters decide whether to keep the politician. 
If they elect a new politician, he is drawn randomly from the same 
distribution. 
The politician in power chooses g2.

          <text>Extreme case: more for oliticians ma attract the t es. . .Political Agency and Electoral Control Selection 
Selection 
In the literature on worker incentives, it is known that higher pay (or 
pay more sensitive to performance) not only aects eort but also 
changes the selection of workers (through dierential hiring or 
selective retention). 
For example, a famous paper by Lazear studies the introduction of 
performance pay (in the form of piece rates) in a large auto glass 
installer. 
Lazear s evidence shows that when this particular company went from 
xed salaries to piece rates productivity rose by 35% because of 
greater eort by the employees (the increase in average wages was 
12%), but a large part of this response was due to selection  the 
composition of employees changed signicantly. 
The same considerations are important in political economy. 
Dierent institutional arrangements (dierent rents) not only aect 
incentives, but may also change the composition of political 
candidates and elected o ceholders.

Main Result 
Theorem 
In the optimal equilibrium, output is distorted downward in period 0 (that 
is, 0 &gt; 0). 
The continuation values promised to the politician (wt ) are non-decreasing 
and converge to some w  . 
Also, distortions disappear in the long run, i.e., t  0 as t  . 
Because future payments to the politician relax the IC constraint, it s 
better to give late rewards than earlier rewards. 
This leads to backloading. 
Why not give everything very late? Because of concave utility. 
So rewards buildup slowly over time, until the IC constraint becomes 
slack.

Term Length and Legislative Eort 
Dal Bo and Rossi (2011) exploit natural experiments from the 
Argentine Congress where term lengths were assigned essentially 
randomly. 
They nd lower eort by legislators who face shorter terms. 
In 1983, 254 House members in Argentina were randomly assigned 
either a two-year or a four-year term. 
in 2001, a constitutional reform led to a similar variation for Senators. 
Out of 71 senators, some were given a two-year, some four-year and 
some others six-year terms. 
They measure eort with attendance, committee participation, 
number of times a legislator speaks on the oor, number of bills 
introduced, and number of bills approved. The authors construct an 
index from these six variables.

Incomplete Information 
Monitoring politicians becomes harder if they have private information 
about economic or other conditions aecting the feasibility or the cost 
of providing public goods. 
Suppose cost of providing unit of public goods is now stochastic, 
  F iid. 
Suppose cost observed only by politician. 
Citizens only see how many goods provided  this implies that 
citizens cannot tell apart whether low public goods are due excessive 
rent grabbing by the politician or because things are going badly in 
the economy.

Audits and Elections 
A very creative paper by Ferraz and Finan (2008) studies the eects 
of random audits of mayors in Brazil. 
They compare mayors revealed to be corrupt right before and right 
after elections. 
Those revealed to be corrupt right after elections are very similar, but 
voters don t have this information (except through other channels 
such as performance). 
The question is whether information revealed from audits aects 
elections relative to the elections of similarly corrupt mayors whose 
information is not been revealed. 
They estimate dierential eects indicating that this is the case. 
Also, the eects are stronger when there are more media channels 
(radio stations) likely publicizing this information to voters.

Discussion 
Comparative statics: in this best equilibrium, citizen utility  in 
, R, y. Is this intuitive? 
In this case, no gains from nonstationary strategies. Why? 
Still, there are other SPEs. How do we ensure that this one arises? 
Are there simple strategies that voters could use to implement this 
SPE? 
Consider retrospective voting strategies, where citizens kick out the 
politician if they fall below a reservation utility. 
Then choose the reservation utility as min{(R + y ), y }. 
But problem: suppose there is cost  of replacing the politician. What 
happens?

Short-Run and Long-Run Distortions 
We can think of the equilibrium being decentralize via a labor tax  
dened by: 
u0 ((1  ) y )= h0 (y) 
Why should we have  &gt; 0? 
distort output down = less for politician to steal 
= relax politician incentive constraint. 
But, it is also e cient to give politician incentives through future 
consumption, or backloading. 
Intuitively, future promises relax politician IC both in the future and 
today. 
But once giving large share of output to politician, there is no longer 
a reason to distort output. So what happens to distortions in the long 
run?

Career Concerns (continued) 
This is therefore a more satisfactory model of deriving results in which 
elections appear as a method of controlling politicians. 
We can again express the equilibrium behavior of voters as electing 
the incumbent if 
g1 = (R + r)  (R + r) 
Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that such decision rules are 
no longer retrospective or pre-determined punishment rules; instead 
they are derived from the forward-looking optimal behavior of the 
voters. This, in particular, implies that even if there were costs of 
replacing the current politician, with su ciently small costs, the same 
equilibrium with the rise.

Does this imply that distortions will always go down to zero? 
Not if the politician is more impatient than citizens (because he will 
be replaced for other reasons for example).

A Study in Selection 
Another interesting paper by Ferraz and Finan (2011) uses 
discontinuous changes in legislator salaries as a function of 
municipality population to study these issues. 
In particular, the maximum salaries of legislatures in Brazil are 
constitutionally linked to municipality population, with this 
continuous changes at 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 300,000 and 500,000 
inhabitants  rst stage shows that these discontinuous maxima 
translate into changes in actual salaries. 
Their main results show signicant improvement in performance due 
to higher salaries, and there is an eect on eort . But also there is 
a large eect on the composition of who runs and thus becomes a 
legislator.

Political Equilibrium 
Under usual conditions, a symmetric political equilibrium will exist 
and will satisfy the rst-order conditions 
0
0(G ) = 
N 
i =0 hi (0) 
hi (0) 0 
y 1 C( ( ))  y .0
= 
N i =0 hi (0) 
Now suppose that hi (0) is very high for some group (i.e., they are 
very responsive transfers). Then relative to the utilitarian benchmark, 
this will lead to equality for the group-specic transfer for that group. 
This will also increase 0 above , which will have two implications: 
1 There will be underinvestment in the general public good. 
2 Taxes will increase (because government resources are now more 
valuable to the party seeking to increase its vote share).

Sketch Proof (continued) 

Suppose condition 3 does not hold for lobby g = 1, and instead of p , 
some pmaximizes (2). 
Denote the dierence in the values of (2) evaluated at these two 
vectors by  &gt; 0. 
Consider the following contribution schedule for lobby g = 1: 
G 0 
g g (p  )+ a G 
 1 (p)= 1 gUg (p  ) [1 
g =1 g =1 
G 0 G 
g g (p)  agUg (p)+ c1 (p)]  
g =2 g =1 
where c1 (p) is an arbitrary function that reaches its maximum at 
p = p. 
Following this contribution oer by lobby 1, the politician would 
choose p = pfor any  &gt; 0.

Dierentiable Contribution Functions (continued) 
Consequently, there is an interesting parallel between the lobbying 
equilibrium and the pure strategy equilibria of probablilistic 
voting models analyzed before. 
Like the latter, the lobbying equilibrium can also be represented as a 
solution to the maximization of a weighted social welfare function, 
with individuals in unorganized groups getting a weight of a and those 
in organized group receiving a weight of 1 + a. Intuitively, 1/a 
measures how much money matters in politics, and the more money 
matters, the more weight groups that can lobby receive. 
As a  , we converge to the utilitarian social welfare function.

To see that this choices optimal for the politician, note that by part 
(1), the politician would choose policy pthat maximizes 
G 0 G

g 1 1 (p)+g g (p)+ a gUg (p)

G 0 G 
g g (p  )+ agUg (p  )+ c1 (p) . = 
g =1 g =1 
Since for any  &gt; 0 this expression is maximized by p, the politician 
would choose p. 
The change in the welfare of lobby 1 as a result of changing its 
strategy is   c1 (p). 
Since  &gt; 0, for small enough , the lobby gains from this change, 
showing that the original allocation could not have been an 
equilibrium.

Lobby A s Problem 
In equilibrium, lobby A either buys cheapest (super)majority that 
lobby B can t protably overturn, or gives up and doesn t pay 
anything. 
What s lobby A s cheapest stable supermajority? 
Lobby B will attack cheapest members of lobby A s majority. 
= lobby A must minimize total cost subject to cheapest majority 
for lobby B costing  wB . 
Consequently, lobby A must equalize the utility of all voters it bribes 
 otherwise it will allow some voters to be cheaply bought back by 
lobby B.

A Failing Democracy 
Villagers are generally dissatised with the performance of rural 
governance institutions, and there is general recognition that power is 
in the hands of upper caste members and landowners. 
Empirical work by Anderson et al. shows that Maratha elites 
dominate politics in places where they are more numerous (in part 
because of block caste voting and the greater social cohesion) but 
also in places where they own more land. 
In such elite-dominated villages, wages are lower (even though 
productivity on agricultural lands and prots are higher). 
Anderson et al. suggest that this pattern reects patron-client 
relations in Maharashtra villages, empowering the elite. We next turn 
to a brief discussion of clan to listen.

Campaign Contributions 
An alternative conception of what organized groups do: campaign 
contributions used for aecting equilibrium election outcomes. 
Consider a probabilistic voting model with campaign contributions. 
Let contributions to party P be where 
Og gCgCP = g P 
Og is an indicator variable for whether group g is organized or not, 
Cg 
P is contribution per member, and g denotes the size of group g. 
The eect of contributions is introduced as aecting the balance of 
dierent politicians. In particular, suppose as before that individuals 
in a group will vote for 
Ui (pA )  Ui (pB )    i , 
where  is an aggregate random valance variable aecting all voters.

Campaign Contributions (continued) 
The important assumption here is that voters are essentially myopic, 
in the sense that they can be swayed by campaign contributions. 
This implies the following complementary slackness conditions for 
campaign contributions (for all groups that are organized) 
g [Ug (pA )  Ug (pB )]  CAg  0, 
and 
g [Ug (pA )  Ug (pB )]  CBg  0, 
which exploits the fact that pA /Cg = g and takes into account A 
that we may be at a corner solution.

The fact that populist policies are often to the left of the median 
voter cannot be explained solely by personal biases of the populist

Not so Dierent in the United States 
Machine politics in the United States is not so dierent. 
Especially before civil service reforms, public sector jobs were under 
the control of mayors, state legislatures and governors. 
In the same way that landowners may use their control of land to 
inuence the voting patterns of their tenants, machine politics may 
involve the use of patronage jobs at the state level to inuence voting. 
This is studied by Folke, Hirano and Snyder (2011) using a 
dierences-in-dierences design (with a touch of close election 
comparison). 
The empirical strategy is to look at the eects of control of state 
lower house on future election outcomes dierentially by states that 
have or have not undergone civil service reforms (which took place 
between 1880 and 1980).

Clientelism in Indian Villages 
Anderson, Franois and Kotwal (2011) provides a possible example of 
captured democracy, rural governance institutions (Gram Panchayats) 
in Maharashtra India. 
Elections are free, with very limited fraud and coercion, and typically 
lead to high representation. 
Citizens also appear to believe that the democratic process works. 
However, land-owning elite from the leading caste, Marathas, 
dominate politics both directly and indirectly, and this often has the 
eect of undermining redistributive policies and also poverty 
alleviation programs.

Clientelism and Democracy 
What s the relationship between clientelism and democracy? 
Clearly, it is democratic competition of sorts that is at the root of the 
type of clientelism outlined here. 
But Lizzeri and Persico (2004) show that an extension of the franchise 
can reduce clientelism because it increases the importance of the 
general-purpose public goods rather than group-specic public goods. 
This is in fact the basis of their alternative theory of democratization in 
19th century Britain. 
If so, the solution to clientelism might be to strengthen rather than rein 
in democracy.

These results follow using an analysis similar to the menu options of 
Bernheim and Whinston (1986). 
Conditions 1 and 2 are easy to understand. 
No group would ever oer a contribution schedule that does not 
satisfy Condition 1. 
Condition 2 has to hold, since the politician chooses the policy. 
If Condition 3 did not hold, then the lobby could change its 
contribution schedule slightly and improve its welfare, as we show 
next.

is a measure of average preferences. 
A utilitarian social planner would have simply maximized this. 
Moreover, given the symmetry of all the groups, we know from our 
above analysis that probabilistic voting would have also maximized 
this. (Symmetry of all groups is adopted to highlight that any 
deviation from utilitarian social welfare function is due to the eects 
of lobbying).

Lobbying (continued) 
The lobbying game takes the following form: 
every organized lobby g simultaneously oers a schedule g (p)  0 
which denotes the payments they would make to the politician when 
policy p P is adopted. 
after observing the schedules, the politician chooses p. 
Notice the important assumption here that contributions to 
politicians (campaign contributions or bribes) can be conditioned on 
the actual policy that s implemented by the politicians. 
This assumption may be a good approximation to reality in some 
situations, but in others, lobbies might simply have to make up-front 
contributions and hope that these help the parties that are expected 
to implement policies favorable to them get elected. 
This is a potentially complex game, since lobbies are choosing 
functions (rather than real numbers or vectors). 
Nevertheless, the equilibrium of this lobbying game takes a relatively 
simple form.

Advantages of Supermajorities 
We will see that sequential vote buying will have a tendency to 
generate a supermajority. 
This is particularly interesting in the context of legislatures (e.g., 
rollcall votes), where typically legislation is not passed with a 
minimum majority but with a supermajority. 
Intuition for supermajority: 
If lobby A buys bare majority, lobby B just has to buy back one guy. 
This is protable for lobby B unless lobby A pays each voter lobby 
B s entire value. 
If lobby A buys one extra voter, lobby B has to buy back two guys. 
Then lobby A only has to pay each voter half of lobby B s value. 
Supermajorities are more robust, and therefore can be cheaper in 
total than bare majorities: pay more guys, but pay each one a lot less.

A Political Theory 
Major concern of the median voter under weak institutions: a 
politician is secretly biased to the right or being disproportionately 
inuenced by the elite (e.g., through bribery, corruption or lobbying). 
Relevant for the Latin American context. 
Politicians will move to the left to signal that they are not closet 
right-wingers or in the pockets of the traditional elites. 
Then: moderate politicians will necessarily adopt populist policies and 
even right-wingers (or corrupt politicians) may adopt such policies. 
Intuition: it is the threat of excessive elite inuence under weaker 
institutions that leads to populist policies.

Therefore, only organized groups can contribute.

further the interests of the group. 
The remaining G  G 0 are unorganized, and will make no

and networks (e.g., Finan and Schechter, 2012). 
It might be very eective in buying turnout (rather than buying 
votes) (e.g., Nichter, 2008). 
Clientelism is most straightforward when it takes the form of vote 
buying or even vote coercion (e.g., Baland and Robinson, 2008). 
But even with secret ballots, reciprocity -type concerns me support 
clientelism (e.g., Finan and Schechter, 2012). 
Why is clientelism dierent than usual electoral politics? Why is it 
ine cient? Here let us focus on a simple model based on a paper by 
Lizzeri and Persico (though much simplied).

          <text>Electoral Politics Gone Wrong Introduction 
Introduction 
In these two lectures, we will see why real-world elections might 
deviate from the implications of our simple theories even more than 
the tests in the previous two lectures indicate. 
These challenges are, at some level, much more to the essence of 
electoral politics. 
They are: 
Lobbying: the fact that organized groups can inuence parties directly 
or indirectly. 
Vote buying: the possibility that organized groups can directly by votes 
from legislators. (This does also relate to political agency and other 
aspects of representative democracy we will discuss into lectures). 
Clientelism and coercion: how voters can be inuenced to vote in ways 
that are not directly in their interests. 
Populism: how extreme or nonsustainable policies may result.

Theorem 
4. There exists a policy pg for every lobby g = 1, 2, .., G 0 such that 
G 0 G 0 0 0 0 pg  arg max  g g (p)+ a  g Ug (p) 
p g 0 =1 g 0=1 
and satises g (pg )= 0. That is, the contribution function of each lobby 
is such that there exists a policy that makes no contributions to the 
politician, and gives her the same utility.

Solution 
In equilibrium, a &lt; 0 
moving from x1 = 0 to x1 &lt; 0 causes second-order loss 
but rst-order gain due to higher chance of reelection 
b &lt; r for the same reason 
This moves a left even further 
For moderate politicians: a right-wing alternative necessitates 
populist bias! 
This would be true even if W = 0 
reelection is valuable as it allows to inuence second-period policy

Modeling Clientelism 
Let us use a version of probabilistic voting. 
Suppose that parties A and B which aim to maximize their vote share. 
Citizens divided into groups i {0, 1, .., N}. Each group i is of size
ni , normalize for simplicity to 1/N. 
Each individual has utility given by 
(1  ) yi + gi +  (G ) ,
where  is a tax rate, yi is the income of group i, gi is the 
group-specic public good or transfer directed to this group, and G is 
a general public good ( parameterizing its e ciency). 
We assume that  is strictly concave and satises the Inada 
conditions.

Clientelism Networks in Mexico 
Larreguy (2013): the role of clientelistic networks in Mexico. 
In Mexico, such networks seem to have been important for the last 70 
years for the support for PRI. 
Particularly important in ejidos and comunidades agrarias controlled by 
the PRI. 
These networks will be particularly powerful when: 
they have the resources and the power to fund political brokers and 
reward voters, and 
they have the ability to monitor vote behavior and particularly, the 
performance of political brokers.

          <text>Electoral Politics Gone Wrong Lobbying 
Lobbying 
We start with a simple model of lobbying due to Grossman and 
Helpman (1994). 
The advantage of this setup is that it links to our simplest model of 
electoral politics  where parties choose policies ex ante  and also 
to our analysis of probabilistic voting. 
Imagine that there are G groups of agents, with the same economic 
preferences. 
The utility of an agent in group g, when the policy that is 
implemented is given by the vector p P RK , is equal to 
Ug (p)  g (p) 
Appier Ug (p) is the usual indirect utility function, and g (p) is the 
per-person lobbying contribution from group g. 
We will allow these contributions to be a function of the policy 
implemented by the politician, and to emphasize this, it is written 
with p as an explicit argument.

          <text>Electoral Politics Gone Wrong A Political Theory of Populism 
What is Populism? 
Typical left-wing populism associated with various policies: 
Budget decits, mandatory wage increases, price controls, overvalued 
exchange rates, expropriation of foreign investors / large businesses. 
Costly to businesses, but also costly to the population at large. 
Dornbush and Edwards (1991): 
Populist regimes have historically tried to deal with income 
inequality problems through the use of overly expansive macroeconomic 
policies. These policies, which have relied on decit nancing, 
generalized controls, and a disregard for basic economic equilibria, have 
almost unavoidably resulted in major macroeconomic crises that have 
ended up hurting the poorer segments of society. 
These are rather dierent from the current right-wing populist 
wave, which is often based on nationalist/anti-immigrant rhetoric and 
policies.

A Simple Model of Vote Buying 
Consider a model due to Groseclose and Snyder (1996). 
There are two lobbies, acting sequentially. 
Suppose, for example, lobby A wants to change the status quo, lobby 
B wants to preserve it. This forces lobby A to make the rst oer in 
order to get out of the status quo. 
But in fact there will still be a status quo bias because of a major 
second-mover advantage.

          <text>Electoral Politics Gone Wrong A Political Theory of Populism 
Comparative Statics (continued) 
Populist bias is stronger if 
W is higher (i.e., politicians value being in o ce more) 
 is lower (i.e., changing political positions is relatively costless for 
politicians) 
 is lower (i.e., moderate politicians are rarer) 
This holds even if W increases or  decreases for only one type of 
politician 
e.g., higher W for pro-elite politicians makes them move left 
and then pro-poor politicians move left as well

Populism and Popularity 
Most populist regimes are popular, at least for quite a while. 
Popularity of populist regimes even allows leaders to violate 
constitutional norms: 
most of Latin American postwar leaders post term-limited (often by 
one term), but many violated the rules. 
this should not be the case if they are known to involve highly 
ine cient policies 
Also interestingly, many of the populist politicians or parties, at least 
in Latin America, often end up choosing policies consistent with the 
interests of traditional elites 
E.g.: PRI in Mexico, the policies of traditional parties in Venezuela and 
Ecuador, Fujimori s reign in Peru, Menem in Argentina.

Possible Denition 
Populism = policy to the left of median voter s ideal policy 
but still popular 
Why would this be the case? 
One-dimensional policy space 
Two points of attraction for politician 
median voter s preferences 
elite s preferences, excercised through bribes 
(personal preferences if partisan) 
Normally, policy should lie between median voter s and elite s ideal 
points. 
But there are informational reasons for policy to be to the left of the 
median voter i.e., populist.

          <text>Electoral Politics Gone Wrong Clientelism 
Clientelism and Patronage Politics 
Another reason why democracy may not reduce inequality is 
clientelism and patronage politics. 
Patronage has many meanings, but in our context, by clientelism, we 
mean the practice of providing specic services, public goods or even 
payments to those who vote for a party or candidate. 
In particular, with clientelism, democratic competition leads to each 
party catering to the needs of a narrow group through ine cient 
transfers or policies. 
Particularly common in Africa after independence: 
African leaders typically used state resources to co-opt 
dierent ethnic elites to maintain political stability. The 
clientelism that resulted was not redistributive and generally 
beneted only a relatively small proportion of the citizenry (van 
de Walle, 2003).

Sketch Proof (continued) 
Finally, condition 4 ensures that the lobby is not making a payment to 
the politician above the minimum that is required. 
Suppose this condition were not true for some lobby, say lobby 1. 
Then lobby 1 could reduce its contribution function by a constant  
from 1 (p) to 1(p)  . Since the shift down by a constant does 
not change marginal incentives for the politician, for  su ciently 
small, the politician would still choose the same policy. But since 
 &gt; 0, lobby 1 would increase its payo.

Dierentiable Contribution Functions (continued) 
Combining these two rst-order conditions, we obtain 
g (p ) Ug (p ) = (3)pk pk 
for all k = 1, 2, .., K and g = 1, 2, .., G 0 . 
Intuitively, at the margin each lobby is willing to pay for a change in 
policy exactly as much as this policy will bring them in terms of 
marginal return. 
But then this implies that the equilibrium can be characterized as 
G 0 G 
p   arg max gUg (p)+ agUg (p) .

Lobbying and Distributional Con ict 
Consider a simple setting with two groups, rich and poor. 
Suppose that the rich are organized and the poor are not. 
Without lobbying, social welfare maximization would typically involve 
redistribution from the rich to the poor. 
But with lobbying, the weight of the rich in the induced social welfare 
function increases, and we may end up with no redistribution.

In other words, despite the convexity of the contribution schedules,

to the party that has a platform that gives its members greater utility.

Lobbying (continued) 
Following Grossman and Helpman, let us assume that there is a 
politician in power, and he has a utility function of the form 
G G 
V (p) g g (p)+ agUg (p) (1) 
g =1 g =1 
g is the share of group g in the population. 
a determines how much the politician cares about aggregate welfare. 
When a = 0, he only cares about money, and when a  , he acts 
as a utilitarian social planner. 
One reason why politicians might care about aggregate welfare is 
because of electoral politics (for example, they may receive rents or 
utility from being in power as in the last subsection and their vote 
share might depend on the welfare of each group).

Coercion 
Even more pernicious than vote buying and clientelism would be 
direct coercion. 
Sometimes the line between coercion and vote buying are blurred 
(traditional networks are good for threats of coercion also). 
An interesting setting is studied by Baland and Robinson (2008), who 
argued that Chilean landowners before the introduction of the secret 
ballot were able to coerce their tenants into voting for right-wing 
parties. 
This changed after the introduction of the secret ballot in 1958.

the level at which electoral data they can use to monitor brokers is

Utilitarian Benchmark 
Let us start with utilitarian benchmark (with equal weight from all 
groups). 
This is a solution to maximizing 
N1  ((1  ) yi + gi )+  (G )N i =0 
subject to the government budget constraint. 
Denoting the Lagrange multiplier on the government resources by , 
the complementary slackness conditions are: 
0(G ) =  
1   
y = y (1  C ()) . 
Inspection shows that if  is greater than some  , then the 
conditions for group specic transfers will be all slack, and all 
redistribution will be through the public good.

A Model of Politics of Fear (continued) 
The instantaneous utility of a citizen of group j in state S is thus: 
C (S, j ) = ( 1  j )(wj  Sj ) + j ((1  j )wj  S j ) + R(Z Sj ) 
The leader wants to maximize the funds that she can divert for her 
own use. 
A leader of group A obtains instantaneous utility (the expression for 
B is just symmetric) as long as she is in power: 
UA = nA (AA  Z AA ) + ( 1  nA )(AB  Z AB ) 
and discounts future payos by . 
When a leader is not in power, she obtains 0 utility per period.

          <text>Political Agency Gone Wrong A Model of Divide and Rule 
Model (continued) 
Suppose only the ruler receives foreign aid (i.e., there is no foreign aid 
in democracy). 
Alternatively, F can be interpreted as the fungible part of foreign aid. 
Then, the instantaneous utilities of the two groups in democracy are: 
1+ ZUD i= + . (9)i 1 +  2 
In contrast, in kleptocracy, the ruler will maximize his consumption, 
subject to the constraint that he keeps power (alternatively, he can be 
removed from power, and in this case, democracy will result, and 
CKt = 0 for all future periods).

Characterization (continued) 
The eective constraint on the ruler will thus be 
AB  B B + AA w (25) 
The equivalent restriction for group A is then 
AA  A A + AB w (26) 
Obviously, both restrictions cannot be binding at the same time.

          <text>Political Agency Gone Wrong A Model of Divide and Rule 
Interpretation 
Intuitively, the divide-and-rule strategy can arise in equilibrium 
because the ruler can shift enough resources to the proposed group. 
In other words, a very ine cient set of policies can be supported 
when each group knows that if it proposes to replace the ruler, the 
ruler will bribe the other group successfully and remain in power. 
Recognizing this o-the-equilibrium path threat, no group will 
challenge the ruler, who will then be able to pursue kleptocratic 
policies along the equilibrium path.

To characterize the solution, let 
 i (1  i ). = 1   
Solving this system for the xed point (A , B ) = (CA , CB ) then 
yields: 
A (1 + B )(AwA + R(Z BB )) + A B (BwB + R(Z AA )) A = 
1 + A + B 
B (1 + A )(BwB + R(Z AA )) + A B (AwA + R(Z BB )) B = 
1 + A + B 
There is a unique xed point and thus a unique MPE.

Theorem 
Let  be given by (24). Then we have: 
1 When   , then the unique MPE is an unconstrained kleptocratic 
regime where (e 
1t , e 2t , T1e
t , T2e
t ) = (   ,   , 0, 0) for all t and i = 1, 2. 
2 When  /, then the unique MPE is a constrained kleptocratic 
regime where the equilibrium policies are 
(e 1t , e 2t , T1e
t , Te ) = ( , , 0, 0) if2t 
(, T = 0) = Z   1  (1  ) F for some  [0,  ], and 2 
(e 1t , e 2t , T1e
t , T2e
t ) = ( 0, 0, T, T) where
( = 0, T) = Z   1  (1  ) F otherwise. 2 
In both cases, a challenge from group j, i.e., pjt = 1, is met by 
(r
jt , Tjt r ) = (   , 0) and (rit , Tit r ) for i 6= j.

Model (continued) 
The government budget constraint is 
T1t + T2t + CKt  R(1t , 2t ) + Z + Ft . (8) 
Here CKt  [0, ) is the consumption of the (kleptocratic) ruler, 
R(1t , 2t ) is tax revenue given by (7), and Ft  [0, ) is foreign aid, 
if any. 
The ruler is assumed to have the utility function at time t: 
 
s K CKs 
s=t 
K &lt; 1 is the discount factor of the ruler, which could dier from 
those of the citizens.

The Dictatorship Game 
The ruler announces tax rates (1t , 2t ) and transfers (T1t , T2t ). 
Each group i decides whether to make a proposal to remove the ruler. 
If no proposal, then (1t , 2t , T1t , T2t ) is implemented and the 
political system remains at St = K . 
If a proposal by one of the groups j, then: the ruler makes a new oer 
of taxes and transfers, (r 
1t , 2r
t , T1r
t , Tr ) such that this policy vector 2t 
satises the government budget constraint, (8). Group i 6= j then 
responds to the proposals of group j and the ruler. 
If the proposed , group i, chooses dit = 1, the ruler is replaced and 
there is a switch to democracy, i.e., St = D. If dit = 0, the political 
system remains at St = K , and (r ) is implemented. 1t , r 
2t , T1r
t , T2r
t 
Given the policy vector, either (1t , 2t , T1t , T2t ) or 
(r 1t , r 2t , T1r
t , Tr ), individuals in both groups choose labor supply. 2t 
Output is produced and consumption takes place. 
If there is a proposal and it is accepted, then in the next period the 
stage game switches to t+1 (D). Otherwise t+1 (K ).

Interpretation (continued) 
Also possible: constrained kleptocratic regime, where the ruler is 
able to pursue kleptocratic policies transferring resources to himself, 
but in this endeavor he is constrained by the threat that the two 
groups will coordinate and remove him from power. 
To avoid this possibility, the ruler reduces the equilibrium taxes (or 
sometimes sets 0 taxes and makes positive transfers) to the two 
groups.

Model (continued) 
The political system is either dictatorship (controlled by the ruler), 
K , or democracy, D. 
Key question: whether dictatorship can survive and to what extent it 
will be kleptocratic (i.e., to what extent the ruler will be able to tax 
producers for his own consumption, while ensuring the survival of the 
dictatorship). 
In democracy, the two producer groups are in power jointly, thus they 
set zero taxes, and share the natural resource rents and foreign aid 
equally (and therefore, set CKt = 0). 
Naturally, more interesting modeling of democracy possible...

Issues in Weakly Institutionalized Societies (continued) 
Let us refer to societies in which politicians can turn tables around 
and exploit cleavages for their own advantage as weakly 
institutionalized polities  . 
Examples of kleptocratic regimes emerging in weakly-institutionalized 
include the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire) under Mobutu 
Sese Seko, the Dominican Republic under Rafael Trujillo, Haiti under 
the Duvaliers, Nicaragua under the Somozas, Uganda under Idi Amin, 
Liberia under Charles Taylor, and the Philippines under Ferdinand 
Marcos.

Note also that VD given by (12) is what the proposed group will i

Issues in Weakly Institutionalized Societies (continued) 
How do we understand weakly-institutionalized politics? 
How could disastrous political leaders remain in power (rather than 
being subject to electoral control of one form or another)? 
In fact, the question is even deeper than this, since the models of 
failure of electoral control seen in the last two lectures imply that if 
politicians are not controlled well, they will get a lot of rents, but this 
may not translate into disastrous economic performance.

Model 
Consider a small open economy (alternatively, an economy with linear 
technology) producing three goods: 
a natural resource, Z , and 
two goods, q1 and q2. 
Normalize the prices of all goods to 1, which is without loss of any 
generality (since dierences in the linear technology of production are 
allowed). 
The production of the natural resource good Zt is constant in all 
periods, 
Zt = Z. 
Natural resources create rents in this economy, which, in turn, aect 
political equilibria. 
Suppose that the natural resource rents accrue to the government, 
and can then be distributed to the producers or consumed by the 
ruler.

the opposite group is in power or whether another leader from her 
own group is in power, the continuation value of an out-of-power 
leader is 0.

Bratton and van der Walle (1997, p. 62): 
the right to  rule in neopatrimonial regimes is ascribed to a 
person rather than to an o ce, despite the o cial existence of a 
written constitution. One individual ... often a president for life, 
dominates the state apparatus and stands above its laws. 
Relationships of loyalty and dependence pervade a formal 
political and administrative system, and o cials occupy 
bureaucratic positions less to perform public service ... than to 
acquire personal wealth and status. Although state functionaries 
receive an o cial salary, they also enjoy access to various forms 
of illicit rents, prebends, and petty corruption, which constitute 
... an entitlement of o ce. The chief executive and his inner 
circle undermine the eectiveness of the nominally modern state 
administration by using it for systematic patronage and clientelist 
practices in order to maintain political order.

Interpretation 
Endogenous ine cient policies for the group to remain in power. 
In particular, excessive provision of group-specic public goods for own 
group and under provision for the other group 
Consistent with Bates s interpretation of agricultural policies in tropical 
Africa. 
The reason is that the ruler needs to buy support from her own group 
while, at the same time, wants to extract a lot of resources from the 
economy. 
Taxation is also dierential across groups 
However, own group is also exploited 
Why do members of the group in power put up with exploitation by 
leaders? 
Politics of fear: they will do even worse under the rule of the other 
group.

Equilibrium (continued) 
From (31), ZAB = 0. 
The reason is that providing patronage good to the excluded group is 
costly and yields no benet, since the supporter group is enough to 
maintain power. 
From (28) and (29) and the fact that  and  cannot both be strictly 
positive at the same time, 
 = 0,  = 1  nA and  = 1. 
 = 0 implies that the ruler endogenously chooses to discriminate 
against the excluded group. 
The reason is that she only needs the support of her own group to 
remain in power and therefore will tax the excluded group as much as 
she can, that is, to the point in which the rst constraint is binding.

          <text>Political Agency Gone Wrong Equilibrium With Inequality 
Equilibrium With Inequality 
When there is inequality between the two groups, the equilibrium is 
similar, though its characterization is more involved. 
The comparative static results discussed previously continue to apply 
with inequality, but there is also a new comparative static with 
respect to inequality, x. 
A greater x greater inequality between the producer groups makes 
the unconstrained kleptocratic regime less likely. 
Intuitively, the more binding constraint from the point of view of the 
ruler is to satisfy the more productive group: when this group 
becomes even more productive, democracy becomes more attractive 
for the producers in this group, and therefore, it becomes more 
di cult for the ruler to buy them o when challenged. 
Possible interpretation: an economically powerful interest group might 
be a good counterweight to kleptocratic rulers.

          <text>Political Agency Gone Wrong Characterization 
Equilibrium (continued) 
Note that every dollar that the ruler is able to tax her own supporters 
is worth more than one for her, because it allows her to tax an extra 
dollar on the excluded group. 
In (30)  multiplies the return from the last unit of patronage given 
to group A. The cost of this last unit is only nA, but its return is 
increased taxation from the whole population (because  = 1). 
This disparity is the reason for ine cient patronage provision. 
Intuitively, the non-subversion constraint is binding and hence an 
increase in R(Z AA ) allows the ruler to increase taxation on her 
supporters and on the other group. 
Hence, patronage good for A is overprovided in equilibrium: the ruler 
considers the benets from increasing taxation from the whole 
population, while a social planner would only consider the group that 
receives utility from it. 
This distortion is worse the narrower the basis of support of the ruler 
(the smaller nA).

          <text>Political Agency Gone Wrong Evidence 
Evidence 
Interesting evidence that these types of considerations are important 
is provided by Anderson and Franois (2017). 
They show that reserving political o ce for members of a particular, 
disadvantaged group, can improve or deteriorate political equilibrium, 
depending on whether there is enough competition. 
If there is enough competition, then politics of fear was pernicious, 
and reservations improve things. 
If there isn t enough competition, then such reservations can make 
things worse. 
In their settings, the reservations are for the position of Pradhan in the 
panchayats in Maharashtra. These are powerful positions in this state. 
They measure the degree of competition by the ethnic composition of 
the sub-caste or jati.

          <text>Political Agency Gone Wrong A Model of Divide and Rule 
A Model of Divide and Rule 
Basic idea: consider a dynamic game between the ruler and two 
producer groups. 
The kleptocratic ruler taxes production and uses the ensuing tax 
revenue, the rents from natural resources and potential foreign aid 
from outside donors for his own consumption. 
The two producer groups, if they can cooperate, can remove the ruler 
from power and establish democracy (a regime more favorable to their 
interests). 
However, weak institutions imply that the ruler can make a 
counteroer to one of the groups and use a divide-and-rule strategy. 
The threat of such a counteroer makes producers unwilling to start 
the process of replacing the ruler. 
So the kleptocrat is not only able to stay in power, but the threat of 
divide-and-rule implies that there will be no challenges to remove him 
from power along the equilibrium path.

Political Game 
In each period, t, society inherits a political state, either St1 = D or 
St1 = K . St1 = D is an absorbing state, so if the economy ever 
becomes a democracy, it remains so forever. If St1 = D, then play

equally). 
If society is a dictatorship, i.e., St1 = K , then the following game, 
t (K ), is played:

Characterization 
Assume without loss of generality that St = A. 
The equilibrium is characterized by backwards induction within each 
stage game. 
Examine rst the decision to switch the sector of production by B 
producers. 
After observing the policy vector Pt , they will switch sector only if the 
loss in wealth is smaller than the dierence in taxation. 
Formally, 
B  AB B  AA B = 1 i w &lt; (1  B )wt 
Since it is in the interest of the ruler not to allow this switch, which is 
wasteful, this ability to switch provides an upper bound on the 
dierential taxation that the ruler can levy on group B.

Interpretation 
Weakness of institutions is central. 
First, as long as the incumbent leader retains the support of her kin 
group, she maintains her position. 
The unique credible source of support is given by the ruler s ethnic 
linkage with her own group. In particular, the excluded group has 
no chance of recovering power if the incumbent leader keeps the 
support from her group. 
Second, if the supporters of an incumbent leader decide to subvert 
the authority of their leader and want to oust her from power, they 
succeed automatically, but when a leader is ousted from power, the 
state does not perform its functions for that period. 
Moreover, during this phase of transition, the excluded group can use 
this opportunity to grab power. 
The status of the group in power will change with probability 1  S . 
Thus S captures the degree to which the grip on power of group S 
is solid in the presence of upheaval from its own members.

power and the next period starts with St+1 = St . Otherwise, the

If group B will exploit group A more, then the leader of group A can 
exploit her own members more and thus exploit group B members 
even more.

Greater F makes    more likely, and when  /, greater F 
increases taxes: Greater F relaxes the budget constraint of the ruler

greater Z relaxes the budget constraint of the ruler. Second, greater

Transitions 
State transitions work as follows. 
St+1 = St whenever stS = 0. If stS = 1, that is, if there is subversion, 
St+1 = St with probability 1  St . 
Denote this transition function T (S , S). 
Hence, power only changes hands with positive probability when the 
supporter group subverts. 
Otherwise the state remains the same. 
Since in equilibrium I will show that there is never subversion, the 
unique equilibrium is stationary.

Interpretation 
This analysis therefore formalizes how the ruler remains in power and 
is able to transfer resources to himself thanks to the divide-and-rule 
strategy. 
He achieves this as follows: when threatened by the proposer 
group, he can always gain the allegiance of the other, proposed 
group, by shifting resources to them. 
Because the proposed group is pivotal, the ruler can remain in power 
if he can successfully buy o the proposed group. 
If this is the case, anticipating this outcome, neither group will 
attempt to remove the ruler from power, and he will be able to 
establish a kleptocratic regime transferring resources to himself at the 
expense of the productive groups in society.

Analysis (continued) 
First, characterize VC [e

can give to the proposed group o the equilibrium path. 
To do this, we need to maximize (16) subject (14), which use 
1 r = 0 and r = .i j 1 +  
Therefore, in ghting o a challenge from group j, the ruler will set 
the revenue-maximizing tax rate on this group, and set zero taxes on 
the proposed group i. 
In addition, the ruler will clearly give the minimum possible amount 
to the proposer group, thus Tr = 0.j 
Then the government budget constraint, (8), implies: 
Tr = R(r

Conclusion 
A set of dierent issues arise politician-citizen interactions in 
weakly-institutionalized polities 
The principal-agent paradigm may not be useful. 
Instead, politicians may structure incentives for citizens via patronage 
or fear in order to remain in power and exploit the population.

Issues in Weakly Institutionalized Societies 
In the context of African politics: issues of Neo-Patrimonialism or 
Personal Rule. 
Extreme personalization of politics where it is not the formal rules of 
the game that matters, but personalities, cliques, families, social 
networks which may function completely outside the formal rules. 
Jackson and Rosberg (1982, pp.17-19): 
a system of relations linking rulers ... with patrons, clients, 
supporters, and rivals, who constitute the  system. If personal 
rulers are restrained, it is by the limits of their personal authority 
and power and by the authority and power of patrons, associates, 
clients, supporters, and of course rivals. The systems is 
 structured... not by institutions, but by the politicians 
themselves.

Economic activity is assumed to be the only characteristic that a 
group can change. 
Members of a group may decide to switch to the activity portfolio of 
the other group, but in the process they will lose a fraction of its 
wealth. 
Hence if group A switches to B s activity, it obtains wA (1  A ) 
Ainstead of w. 
i thus captures the extent to which a group s wealth is specic to a 
particular activity. 
Let i = 1 if group i switches activities in period t. Otherwiset

Utility maximization implies

The solution for patronage public goods (32) and (33) is thus 
independent of expectations of future play, but this is not the case for 
the amount of resources that the leader can extract from both groups. 
In fact, the solution above presents a mapping between future 
equilibrium play and current taxation. 
The problem of leader LB is symmetric and thus 
ZBA = 0

Characterization (continued) 
Let us examine now the decision to subvert (replaced the leader) by 
A supporters. 
The leader is the rst player to act in the stage game. 
As a consequence, since strategies can only be conditional on the 
state of the economy, a leader LA always proposes the same policy 
vector PA . 
Upon observing PA, if there is no subversion (st = 0), A supporters 
obtain: 
A  AA w + R(Z AA ) + VA (A) 
Alternatively, if they subvert, st = 1, they expect: 
Aw+ AV A (A) + (1  A )VA (B) 
Hence the non-subversion condition is 
AA  R(Z AA )  (1  A )(VA (A)  VA (B)) (27)

Denition of Equilibrium 
Focus on (pure strategy) Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE). 
The state space of this economy includes only two elements, 
 = {A, B}, designating which group is in power. 
Denote the state at each period by St , where obviously St  , 
t = 0, 1, 2.... 
Assume that each group has a set of potential leaders from which 
replacements will be drawn randomly. 
Call these two sets of leaders A and B . 
At any point in time, the leader in power is denoted by LA or LB 
depending on the group she was drawn from. 
Denote by LA the potential leaders that belong to A but are not in 
power currently. LB is dened symmetrically. 
The strategy of the current leader LA is denoted by PA and it is a 
four-tuple {AA , AB , Z AA , ZAB } R4 when St = A.+ 
When either St = B or St = A but a leader belongs to LA, her set of 
strategies is empty.

We have seen the use of clientelistic policies both in developing

But in extreme cases of patron-client relations, which happens in 
particular in weakly-institutionalized societies, it becomes blurred 
whether we can think of politicians is the agent. 
Put dierently, who is the agent and who is the principal ?

Strategies 
The strategy of group A is denoted A (S, PS ) and depends on both 
the state of political capture and the policy vector proposed by the 
leader. 
AIt determines two actions, {s, A } that have been dened above as 
the decision to subvert and the decision to switch economic activities. 
If St = A, sA {0, 1}, that is, if the leader is from group A, this 
group can decide to give her support or to subvert her authority. 
AOn the other hand, if St = B, s= . A {0, 1} independently of 
the state. 
The symmetric denition holds for the strategy space of citizens of 
group B.

Note that the ruler will always satisfy this constraint. 
Hence in any MPE there will never be any ousting of a ruler. 
Since no change of ruler implies no change of state, any MPE of this 
game will be stationary, with the ruler proposing always the same PA 
which will be accepted every time. 
After imposing stationarity, this constraint can be written as 
 AA  R(Z AA )  BA  R(ZBA )  AA (1  A )[  + R(ZAA )] 1   
Here the  denotes equilibrium values. Note that the right hand side

Model (continued) 
The only redistributive tools in the economy are a linear income tax 
that is potentially specic to each group, and group-specic 
lump-sum transfers. 
The option to use group-specic taxes and transfers are important for 
the results, and plausible in the context of African societies, where 
there are clear geographic and ethnic distinctions between producer 
groups. 
Naturally, weak institutions important here as well. 
The post-tax income of the two groups are 
yit =(1  it ) ilit + Tit . (4) 
Here it  [0, 1] is the income tax imposed on group i at time t and 
Tit  [0, ) is a (non-negative) lump-sum transfer to group i.
