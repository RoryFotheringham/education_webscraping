          <text>Suppose, as has been suggested in the literature, that scrambling of a quantifier may count as an 
instance of overt QR (cf. Kitahara (1995), Miyagawa (2003b), Sohn (1995),Tonoike (1997)). 
(35) Scope Economy (Fox 2000) 
A Scope Shifting Operation can move XP1 from a position in which it is interpretable only 
if the movement crosses XP2 and &lt;XP1, XP2&gt; is not scopally commutative. (Fox 2000:26) 
Optional application of QR is possible if it leads to a new scope relation 
May (1977): QR is clause bound. 
(36)	 a. Someone loves everyone. 
some &gt; every, every &gt; some 
b. Someone thinks that Mary loves everyone.
some &gt; every, *every &gt; some
Moltmann and Szabolci (1994) as discussed by Fox (2000). 
(37)	 a. One girl knows that every boy bought a present for Mary. 
one &gt; every, *every &gt; one 
b. One girl knows what every boy bought for Mary.
one &gt; every, every &gt; one

everyone-ACCi someone-NOM [ti Tanaka-NOM ti love C] said 
'Everyone, someone said that Tanaka loves t.'

This example shows the effect of "clause boundedness" of QR.

          <text>When, precisely, does radical reconstruction occur? 
Neeleman and Reinhart (1998): scrambling may lead to a variation in the focus potential of the 
sentence. See Ishihara (2001). 
(52)	 Taroo-ga [VP hon-o katta] 
Taro-Nom [VP book-Acc bought] 'Taro bought a book.' 
(52) can be used as an answer to the following three questions:
(53) a.	What happened? (focus on IP) 
b. What did Taro do? (focus on VP) 
c. What did Taro buy? (focus on object) 
(54) has a different focus domain set due to the scrambling of the object.
(54)	 Hon-oi Taroo-ga [ ti katta]VP 
book-Acci Taro-Nom[ ti bought]VP 
The focus domains are the subject NP Taroo  and the TP, but the VP cannot be a focus domain 
because it does not contain the stress. Therefore (54) cannot be used to answer &#8220;What did Taro 
do?&#8221; 
(55) Hanako-ga [ Taroo-ga hon-o katta to]itta. CP 
Hanako-Nom [ Taro-Nom book-Acc bought C] saidCP 
'Hanako said that Taro bought a book.' 
This sentence can be used to answer the following three questions. 
(56) a.	What did Hanako say happened? (focus on subordinate IP) 
b. What did Hanako say that Taro did? (focus on subordinate VP) 
c. What did Hanako say that Taro bought? (focus on subordinate object) 
(57)	 Hon-oi Hanako-ga [CP ti Taroo-ga ti katta to] itta. 
Book-Acci Hanako-Nom [CP ti Taroo-Nom ti bought C] said 
The scrambling of hon-o 'book-Acc' within the subordinate clause deprives the focus reading on 
the VP, as we saw for the example (54). This means that this scrambling has a meaningful effect 
on the output of this movement, hence the first movement is licensed. Note, now, that the entire sentence in (57) can answer (56a) and (56c), but not (56b). 
(58) Radical reconstruction ("PF" scrambling) Radical reconstruction occurs only if a quantifier is moved by illicit optional movement. 
This is a fundamentally different portrayal of radical reconstruction than Saito (1989) and 
Sauerland and Elbourne (2002). They assume that radical reconstruction &#8212; or PF scrambling &#8212;

EPP AND SEMANTICALLY VACUOUS SCRAMBLING 
Shigeru Miyagawa 
MIT 
1. Saito's Discovery (1989) &#8211; evidence used for a widely accepted view of scrambling 
Scrambling in Japanese results from a purely optional movement operation (e.g., Fukui 1993; 
Kuroda 1988; Saito 1989, 2004; Saito and Fukui 1998; Takano 1998 
(1) a. John-ga [ Taroo-ga nani-o katta ka] siritagatteiru.WH-ISD 
John-NOM [ Taro-NOM what-ACC bought Q] want:to:knowWH-ISD 
'John wants to know what Taro bought.' 
b. ?Nani-oi John-ga [ Taroo-ga ti katta ka] siritagatteiru. WH-ISD 
what-ACCi John-NOM [ Taro-NOM ti bought Q] want:to:knowWH-ISD 
(2)	 Minimalist version of Saito's (1989) argument (Saito 2004) 
Scrambling in Japanese is not driven by the EPP. 
2. Optional movement and the EPP 
Reinhart (1995) and particularly Fox (2000) propose a theory of optional operation which 
imposes a requirement on the movement as follows. Fox specifically addresses instances in which QR may apply optionally. 
(3) 	 Scope Economy (Fox 2000) 
A Scope Shifting Operation can move XP1 from a position in which it is interpretable 
only if the movement crosses XP2 and &lt;XP1, XP2&gt; is not scopally commutative. (Fox 
2000:26) 
Chomsky (2001) applies this notion of requiring some effect on the output to optional movements such as OS (Holmberg 1986) 
(4) a.	v* is assigned an EPP feature only if that has an effect on outcome. 
b. The EPP position of v* is assigned INT. 
(5) Optional operations can apply only if they have an effect on outcome... (Chomsky 2001:34) 
3. Saito (2004) on Saito (1989) 
Saito (1989) adopts is that movement operations are subject to the Proper Binding Condition (PBC). 
(6) Traces must be bound. (Fiengo 1977, May 1977)

5. Escape hatch in indirect question: the real significance of Saito (1989) 
Saito&#8217;s (1989) &#8220;discovery,&#8221; with some extensions, gives support to two proposals in the 
literature: 
-- Watanabe's (1992) proposal that an empty operator is moving in wh-in-situ (or alternatively, 
Tsai's (1994) idea that wh-in-situ is licensed by unselective binding by Q on C); 
-- A particular version of Kuroda's (1988) idea that there is "no forced agreement" in Japanese; 
the particular version I will demonstrate is that when a Head agrees with an element, the specifier of this Head may host some other element, thus showing that there is no forced Spec-Head agreement. 
What really is happening with Saito&#8217;s (10b), repeated below? 
(10) b. ?Nani-oi John-ga [ Taroo-ga ti katta ka] siritagatteiru.WH-ISL 
what-ACCiJohn-NOM [ Taro-NOM ti bought Q] want:to:knowWH-ISL 
'John wants to know what Taro bought.' 
The wh-phrase is able to employ the Specifier of CP of the indirect question as an escape hatch. 
(26) 	 ?Nani-oi John-ga [WH-ISL ti [TPTaroo-ga ti katta ka]] siritagatteiru. 
what-ACCi John-NOM [WH-ISL ti [TP Taro-NOM ti bought Q]] want:to:know 
'John wants to know what Taro bought.' 
Two possible reasons why the wh-phrase may move through the Spec of CP:
 (i) the scrambling of the wh-phrase into the Spec of CP counts as wh-movement, and fulfills the
[+wh] selectional requirement (e.g., Takahashi 1993 
(ii) the [+wh] requirement is met even before the wh-phrase moves; an agreement relation is
established between the wh feature on the wh-phrase-in-situ and the Q feature on C 
(ii) is right?
(27) ?Nani-oi John-ga  [WH-ISL ti [TP dare-ga ti katta ka]] siritagatteiru ndai?
 what-ACCi John-NOM [WH-ISL ti [TP who-NOM ti bought Q]] want:to:know Q 
'What does John wants to know who bought?' (answer: John wants to know who bought A BOOK.)

4.2. Reanalyzing Saito&#8217;s arguments 
As noted earlier, Saito (1989) gave following kinds of arguments against reconstruction. 
(17)a. ??Whoi do you wonder [which picture of ti]j John likes tj? 
b. *[Which picture of ti]j do you wonder whoi John likes tj?

b. ?? [Which picture of whom]j do you wonder whoi ti bought tj?

May (1985) 
(19) Whati did every boy buy ti? PL 
Longobardi (1987) 
(20) Whati do you wonder whether every boy bought ti? *PL 
4.3. Argument against radical reconstruction 
Direct evidence against two points Saito suggests: 
(i) 	there is no reconstruction due to the PCB; 
(ii) the wh-phrase in (1b), which has scrambled out of an indirect question, undergoes radical
reconstruction. 
Lebeaux (1988); cf. also van Riemsdijk and Williams (1981), Freidin (1986)). Note the contrast 
below. 
(21) ??/*[Which criticism of Johni]j did hei reject tj? 
(22) [Which criticism that Johni heard]j did hei believe tj? 
The data gives evidence for reconstruction in English, in contrast to the assertion in Saito (1989). 
Nishigauchi (2002) observes that there is a similar argument/adjunct asymmetry in Japanese; I will introduce a crucial example from his work later, but because it involves one complication, I will first present a pair of examples below to illustrate the &#8220;Lebeaux&#8221; effect in Japanese. 
(23)	 a. ??/?* [Minna-no Johni-no hihan-o]j karei-ga

          <text>is widely prevalent. What I have shown is that PF scrambling occurs in an extremely narrow 
range of data &#8212; when a quantifier is moved illicitly. 
A prediction about a Condition C violation that should occur even if the antecedent is contained 
in an adjunct. Note the contrast below.

(50) Obligatory and optional scrambling 
(i) Clause-internal scrambling triggered by the EPP on T &#8212; it is not an optional 
movement;
 (ii) Long-distance scrambling is an optional movement, and is subject to the condition on optional operation. 
(51) Types of chain spell-outs

In (25a) with the unaccusative tukamari  &#8216;catch&#8217;, the ni-phrase &#8220;by the 
policeman&#8221; is clearly in the scope of &#8211;sae &#8216;even&#8217;, showing again that the ni-
phrase is selected by the unaccusative and occurs in the VP headed by the 
unaccusative. In (25b), -sae &#8216;even&#8217; attaches to the transitive verb tukamae  
&#8216;catch&#8217;, which is passivized. As we can see, the ni-phrase here is outside the 
scope of the verb, so that the only item th at can be focused is the verbal head.

Children have much easier time with unaccusatives than with the passive. 
 Two possibilities, both rejected by Sano, etc. 
(A)  The &#8220;unergative misanalysis&#8221; in which unaccusatives are misanalyzed as 
unergatives, hence ACDH does not inhibit comprehension (Borer and Wexler (1987), Babyonyshev, Ganger, Pesetsky and Wexler (2001)). Sano (2000) and 
Sano, Endo &amp; Yamakoshi (2001) suggest that this cannot account for the early 
development of Full unaccusatives because children behave differently between 
unaccusatives and unergatives con cerning the omission of nominative ga.  
 (B) Sano (2000) and Sano, Endo, and Yamakoshi (2001) argue against the non-
raising misanalysis (Miyamoto, Wexler, Aikawa and Miyagawa (1999)), in 
which the nominative NP of the unaccusative sometimes (when ga is missing) 
does not raise. They point out that ch ildren do not produce sentences such as 
(2a) and they do not have any proble m in interpreting transitives with null 
objects as in (2b).    
(2) a. *Zou-san ga buta-san ga sizume-ta. 
  elephant NOM pig * sank   &#8216;The elephant sank the pig.&#8217;

Elephant NOM (pig ACC ) buried Q 
&#8216;Did the elephant bury (pro)?&#8217; 
(Sano, Endo, &amp; Yamakoshi 2001: 674) 
 
If it is possible for the nominative NP of an unaccusative to stay in its 
complement position, we should also see the nominative case marking on the 
direct object of transitives as in (2a), according to Sano, etc., something that is 
not attested in any significant measure.

(Sano, 2000:14, Table 4) 
 
Sano presents this as evidence agains t the ACDH because both unaccusatives 
and passives involve an A-chain.  
There are at least two problems here .  First, Sano (2000) uses only tukamaru  
&#8216;catch unaccusative &#8217; as an example of a &#8220;full&#8221; un accusative.  In fact &#8220;full&#8221; 
unaccusatives &#8211; those that allow an &#8220;agentive&#8221; &#8211;ni phrase &#8212; are extremely rare.  
Sano, Endo and Yamakoshi (2001) also use mitukaru  &#8216;find&#8217;, which they claim 
has the same pattern of acquisition as tukamaru  &#8216;catch&#8217;.  We are not aware of 
other &#8220;full&#8221; unaccusatives in the lang uage.  Second, while giving up on the 
ACDH is one option, that per se can only explain the pattern in (6).  It would have nothing to say about the discovery in Ito and Wexler (2003) that the pattern 
of nominative case marker drop suggests  that unaccusatives begin behaving like 
unergatives at around the age of three.  As mentioned already, a plausible way to 
explain this is that at this stage ACDH  is still in effect, hence there is no 
grammatical A-chain.  The children theref ore &#8220;misanalyze&#8221; the unaccusatives as 
unergatives in order to avoid violation of the ACDH.  
There is one crucial point Sano does not mention concerning the unaccusative 
verb tukamaru  &#8216;get caught&#8217;. There exists a hom ophone of the unaccusative verb 
tukamaru . Note that tukamaru  in (7) is an unergative ve rb that means &#8216;hold on to 
(something).&#8217;

2.1 Unaccusatives and the nominative case drop phenomenon 
 
Miyamoto et al.(1999) and Ito and Wexler (2002 
 (3)   Rates of Nom omission for NPs according to verb type 
 
Lexical 
unaccusatives aru (there&#8217;s)  nai (there isn&#8217;t)  Other verbs

(Miyamoto et al.: 450, Table 4) 
 
 
Nom ga omission is much higher with lexical unaccusatives and existentials 
than with other verbs. 
 
Ito and Wexler (2002) did a similar study of nominative marker omission. They used a different corpus&#8212;the transcripts of a Japanese child, Sumihare, during 
ages 1;11-3;7 (MacWhinney 2000; Noji 1973-77). Their study is particularly 
important in examining the nominative case omission at a later stage. (4)  shows the results of their study that are relevant here.

Nominative case marking is omit ted both in unaccusatives and 
unergatives/transitives. 
The second stage, ages 2;2-3;0 
Nominative case marking is much  more frequently omitted for 
unaccusatives than for unergatives/transitives. 
The third stage, ages 3;1-3;7. 
The omission rate of nominative markers is not different between the two categories.  </text>

          <text> 12Machida (2004) argues that the passive  of psychological verbs followed by an 
aspect morpheme &#8211; te i (ru ) (resultative) is the only possible adjectival passive in 
Japanese. The degree adverb totemo  &#8216;very&#8217;, which typically modifies adjectives, 
can modify the passive of the psyschological verb ais &#8216;love&#8217; with &#8211;te i (ru) as we 
can see in (29a). But it cannot modify a verbal passive such as &#8216;was eaten&#8217; as 
shown in (29b). 
 (29) a. Taro-wa kazoku-ni totemo ais-are-te i-ru. 
  Taro-Top family-by very love-Pass-Past-te i-Pre 
  &#8216;Taro is loved by his family very much.&#8217;

frog-Nom snake-by very      eat-Pass-Past 
&#8216;lit. A frog was very much eaten by a snake.&#8217; 
 
Terzi and Wexler&#8217;s (2002) finding that in Greek, which also does not have s-homophone adjectival passives of the verbal passive, children&#8217;s comprehension 
of even the actional passive is delayed.

          <text> 7Miyagawa argues that the same requirem ent accounts for the distinction between 
NP and PP, as seen in (1 5) (cf. Shibatani 1978).

  Students-NOM three-CL st ory-ACC teacher-from hear-PAST 
 &#8216;Three students heard the story from the teacher.&#8217;  
Examples in (16) show that the ni-phrase with both the Full unaccusative and 
the Full passives are PPs. 
 
(16) a. *gakusei-ga    sensei-ni   san-nin    tukamat-ta.    student-NOM t eacher-by three-CL catch (unacc.)-PAST

          <text> 6Summary: 
(11)  a. Nominative case omission shows that the NP is not raised for  
unaccusatives because A-chains  are not fully formed for 
young children under three. (Miyamoto et al. 1999, Ito and Wexler 2002); 
 b Children start utilizing the structure of unergatives to 
interpret unaccusatives in the third year. Therefore, nominative case omission reduces to the level of 
transitive/unergatives at this stage. Their interpretation of 
unaccusatives improves once they acquire the unergative strategy. 
c.   Passives are delayed because A-chains are not fully formed 
throughout the three stages.

(Sano, Endo and Yamakoshi 2001) 
 
Sano (2000) and Sano, Endo and Yamakoshi (2001) show that the children in their experiment perform better with Fu ll unaccusatives than w ith Full passives.  
They claim that this poses a prob lem for the ACDH because both Full 
unaccusatives and Full passives involve an A-chain.

 Since the ni-phrase lies within the VP and is se lected by the unaccusative verb (a 
very small number in the language, as it turns out), it is plausible that children 
utilize the structure of unergatives to interpret the Full unaccusative. The ni-
phrase is just like a locative or a go al PP selected by unergative verbs 
 
5. Development of passives in Japanese 
 
What about passives? We suggest that Japanese children show difficulty with 
actional passives because there are no  homophonous adjectival passives in 
Japanese.   
Wasow (1977)  
 
Borer and Wexler (1987), for example, propose that English speaking children 
do much better with passives of actional verbs than non-actional (experiencer verb) passives (Maratsos et al., 1985) because they interpret actional verb 
passives as adjectival passives). 
 
(28) A phrase &#945;is an s-homophone of &#946;if &#945;and &#946;have distinct structure but 
common pronunciation. 
(Babyonyshev et al. 2001:7) 
 
If their language has s-homophone adjectival passives, children under certain 
age substitute the structure of  adjectival passive for the verbal passive &#8212; this is 
how they get around the ACDH.    </text>

 &#8216;The pig was caught by the elephant.&#8217; 
 
The unergative verb tukamaru  &#8216;hold on to (something)&#8217; in (7) is not tested in 
Sano (2000), but the children would not have a problem in interpreting (7) 
because it does not involve an A-chain  Observe other unaccusative verbs in (9). They further confirm that 
children can start interpreting unaccusatives  early, at the age of three. Even G1 
children perform well in understanding unaccusatives, which is consistent with our hypothesis that the unergative misanalysis is available once children reach 
the age of three.

 Introduction 
Sano (2000), Sano, Endo, &amp; Yamakoshi (2001), Okabe &amp; Sano (2002), and 
Sano (2003) argue against the A-Chai n Deficit Hypothesis (hereafter, the 
ACDH) (Borer &amp; Wexler 1987, 1992), which states that A-chains are 
ungrammatical for a child until a certain age or level of maturation. Their major 
argument against the ACDH is based on experiments using what they call &#8220;Full 
unaccusatives&#8221; and &#8220;Full passives&#8221; in Japanese, which are shown in (1).

          <text>Suppose, as has been suggested in the literature, that scrambling of a quantifier may count as an 
instance of overt QR (cf. Kitahara (1995), Miyagawa (2003b), Sohn (1995),Tonoike (1997)). 
(35) Scope Economy (Fox 2000) 
A Scope Shifting Operation can move XP1 from a position in which it is interpretable only 
if the movement crosses XP2 and &lt;XP1, XP2&gt; is not scopally commutative. (Fox 2000:26) 
Optional application of QR is possible if it leads to a new scope relation 
May (1977): QR is clause bound. 
(36)	 a. Someone loves everyone. 
some &gt; every, every &gt; some 
b. Someone thinks that Mary loves everyone.
some &gt; every, *every &gt; some
Moltmann and Szabolci (1994) as discussed by Fox (2000). 
(37)	 a. One girl knows that every boy bought a present for Mary. 
one &gt; every, *every &gt; one 
b. One girl knows what every boy bought for Mary.

everyone-ACCi someone-NOM [ti Tanaka-NOM ti love C] said

This example shows the effect of "clause boundedness" of QR.

          <text>When, precisely, does radical reconstruction occur? 
Neeleman and Reinhart (1998): scrambling may lead to a variation in the focus potential of the 
sentence. See Ishihara (2001). 
(52)	 Taroo-ga [VP hon-o katta] 
Taro-Nom [VP book-Acc bought] 'Taro bought a book.' 
(52) can be used as an answer to the following three questions:
(53) a.	What happened? (focus on IP) 
b. What did Taro do? (focus on VP) 
c. What did Taro buy? (focus on object) 
(54) has a different focus domain set due to the scrambling of the object.
(54)	 Hon-oi Taroo-ga [ ti katta]VP 
book-Acci Taro-Nom[ ti bought]VP 
The focus domains are the subject NP Taroo  and the TP, but the VP cannot be a focus domain 
because it does not contain the stress. Therefore (54) cannot be used to answer &#8220;What did Taro 
do?&#8221; 
(55) Hanako-ga [ Taroo-ga hon-o katta to]itta. CP 
Hanako-Nom [ Taro-Nom book-Acc bought C] saidCP 
'Hanako said that Taro bought a book.' 
This sentence can be used to answer the following three questions. 
(56) a.	What did Hanako say happened? (focus on subordinate IP) 
b. What did Hanako say that Taro did? (focus on subordinate VP) 
c. What did Hanako say that Taro bought? (focus on subordinate object) 
(57)	 Hon-oi Hanako-ga [CP ti Taroo-ga ti katta to] itta. 
Book-Acci Hanako-Nom [CP ti Taroo-Nom ti bought C] said 
The scrambling of hon-o 'book-Acc' within the subordinate clause deprives the focus reading on 
the VP, as we saw for the example (54). This means that this scrambling has a meaningful effect 
on the output of this movement, hence the first movement is licensed. Note, now, that the entire sentence in (57) can answer (56a) and (56c), but not (56b). 
(58) Radical reconstruction ("PF" scrambling) Radical reconstruction occurs only if a quantifier is moved by illicit optional movement. 
This is a fundamentally different portrayal of radical reconstruction than Saito (1989) and 
Sauerland and Elbourne (2002). They assume that radical reconstruction &#8212; or PF scrambling &#8212;

EPP AND SEMANTICALLY VACUOUS SCRAMBLING 
Shigeru Miyagawa 
MIT 
1. Saito's Discovery (1989) &#8211; evidence used for a widely accepted view of scrambling 
Scrambling in Japanese results from a purely optional movement operation (e.g., Fukui 1993; 
Kuroda 1988; Saito 1989, 2004; Saito and Fukui 1998; Takano 1998 
(1) a. John-ga [ Taroo-ga nani-o katta ka] siritagatteiru.WH-ISD 
John-NOM [ Taro-NOM what-ACC bought Q] want:to:knowWH-ISD 
'John wants to know what Taro bought.' 
b. ?Nani-oi John-ga [ Taroo-ga ti katta ka] siritagatteiru. WH-ISD 
what-ACCi John-NOM [ Taro-NOM ti bought Q] want:to:knowWH-ISD 
(2)	 Minimalist version of Saito's (1989) argument (Saito 2004) 
Scrambling in Japanese is not driven by the EPP. 
2. Optional movement and the EPP 
Reinhart (1995) and particularly Fox (2000) propose a theory of optional operation which 
imposes a requirement on the movement as follows. Fox specifically addresses instances in which QR may apply optionally. 
(3) 	 Scope Economy (Fox 2000) 
A Scope Shifting Operation can move XP1 from a position in which it is interpretable 
only if the movement crosses XP2 and &lt;XP1, XP2&gt; is not scopally commutative. (Fox 
2000:26) 
Chomsky (2001) applies this notion of requiring some effect on the output to optional movements such as OS (Holmberg 1986) 
(4) a.	v* is assigned an EPP feature only if that has an effect on outcome. 
b. The EPP position of v* is assigned INT. 
(5) Optional operations can apply only if they have an effect on outcome... (Chomsky 2001:34) 
3. Saito (2004) on Saito (1989) 
Saito (1989) adopts is that movement operations are subject to the Proper Binding Condition (PBC). 
(6) Traces must be bound. (Fiengo 1977, May 1977)

5. Escape hatch in indirect question: the real significance of Saito (1989) 
Saito&#8217;s (1989) &#8220;discovery,&#8221; with some extensions, gives support to two proposals in the 
literature: 
-- Watanabe's (1992) proposal that an empty operator is moving in wh-in-situ (or alternatively, 
Tsai's (1994) idea that wh-in-situ is licensed by unselective binding by Q on C); 
-- A particular version of Kuroda's (1988) idea that there is "no forced agreement" in Japanese; 
the particular version I will demonstrate is that when a Head agrees with an element, the specifier of this Head may host some other element, thus showing that there is no forced Spec-Head agreement. 
What really is happening with Saito&#8217;s (10b), repeated below? 
(10) b. ?Nani-oi John-ga [ Taroo-ga ti katta ka] siritagatteiru.WH-ISL 
what-ACCiJohn-NOM [ Taro-NOM ti bought Q] want:to:knowWH-ISL 
'John wants to know what Taro bought.' 
The wh-phrase is able to employ the Specifier of CP of the indirect question as an escape hatch. 
(26) 	 ?Nani-oi John-ga [WH-ISL ti [TPTaroo-ga ti katta ka]] siritagatteiru. 
what-ACCi John-NOM [WH-ISL ti [TP Taro-NOM ti bought Q]] want:to:know 
'John wants to know what Taro bought.' 
Two possible reasons why the wh-phrase may move through the Spec of CP:
 (i) the scrambling of the wh-phrase into the Spec of CP counts as wh-movement, and fulfills the
[+wh] selectional requirement (e.g., Takahashi 1993 
(ii) the [+wh] requirement is met even before the wh-phrase moves; an agreement relation is
established between the wh feature on the wh-phrase-in-situ and the Q feature on C 
(ii) is right?
(27) ?Nani-oi John-ga  [WH-ISL ti [TP dare-ga ti katta ka]] siritagatteiru ndai?
 what-ACCi John-NOM [WH-ISL ti [TP who-NOM ti bought Q]] want:to:know Q 
'What does John wants to know who bought?' (answer: John wants to know who bought A BOOK.)

4.2. Reanalyzing Saito&#8217;s arguments

May (1985) 
(19) Whati did every boy buy ti? PL 
Longobardi (1987) 
(20) Whati do you wonder whether every boy bought ti? *PL 
4.3. Argument against radical reconstruction 
Direct evidence against two points Saito suggests: 
(i) 	there is no reconstruction due to the PCB; 
(ii) the wh-phrase in (1b), which has scrambled out of an indirect question, undergoes radical
reconstruction. 
Lebeaux (1988); cf. also van Riemsdijk and Williams (1981), Freidin (1986)). Note the contrast 
below. 
(21) ??/*[Which criticism of Johni]j did hei reject tj? 
(22) [Which criticism that Johni heard]j did hei believe tj? 
The data gives evidence for reconstruction in English, in contrast to the assertion in Saito (1989). 
Nishigauchi (2002) observes that there is a similar argument/adjunct asymmetry in Japanese; I will introduce a crucial example from his work later, but because it involves one complication, I will first present a pair of examples below to illustrate the &#8220;Lebeaux&#8221; effect in Japanese.

range of data &#8212; when a quantifier is moved illicitly.

in an adjunct. Note the contrast below.

5.1.2  Indeterminate Pronoun (Kishimoto 2001) 
 
An indeterminate pronoun is a wh-phrase that is interpreted as a universal any in the scope of the 
universal particle mo.  To make this interpretation possibl e, the indeterminate pronoun must be c-
commanded by the universal &#8211;mo, and they must be clausemates. 
(24)a.  Taro-ga       nani-o         kai- mo-si-nakat-ta. 
           Taro-NOM  what-ACC buy-MO-do-NEG-past 
            &#8216;Taro did not buy anything.&#8217; 
      b. * Dare -ga          warai- mo-si-nakat-ta. 
              who-NOM   laugh-MO-do- NEG-PAST               &#8216;No one laughed.&#8217;       c. * Dare -ga         Hanako-o       home- mo-si-nakat-ta. 
             who-NOM   Hanako-ACC praise-MO-do-not-past 
             &#8216;No one praised Hanako.&#8217;                                        (Kishimoto 2001: 600) As Kishimoto notes, while the object position can host an indeterminate pronoun ((24a)), the 
subject position cannot ((24b/c)).  The subjec t position is outside the domain of the mo particle, 
which he assumes is at v.   
 (25) a.    Kodomo-ga   san-nin  dono-eiga -o          mi- mo-si-nakat-ta. 
               kids-NOM   3- CL   which-movie-ACC  see-MO-do-NOT-PAST.

             &#8216; Three children did not see any movie so far.&#8217; In (25b), which is a non-sta ndard judgment case, the obj ect indeterminate pronoun is 
ungrammatical, indicating that this obj ect has moved to the Spec of TP.

3  Counterexamples to Locality 
 
Counterexamples to syntactic locality (e.g., Gunji and Hasida 1998, Ishii 1998, Kuno 1978, 
Kuno and Takami 2003, Nishigauch i and Ishii 2003, Takami 1998) 
 Two patterns:
 
(10) ?Gakusei-ga        sake-o       imamadeni   san-nin   nonda  
   student-NOM  sake-ACC   so far        3-CL SUB  drank 
  &#8216;Three students drank sake so far.&#8217;                       (Gunji and Hasida 1998: 57)

  &#8216;Only two students bought my book.&#8217;                 (cf. Takami 1998, 1: 92)  
4  Responding to the Counterexamples 
 
Saito (1985) assumed the following for the standard judgment. (12)  (i)  NQ and the associated noun phrase observe strict locality. 
  (ii) The subject in Japanese cannot scramble. 
Every linguist who has presented a counterexample has concluded that (12i) must be rejected.

(cf. Tada 1993 for the observation that long-distance scrambled QP must obligatorily
reconstruct;  this is due to the fact that this is A'-scrambling (cf. also Saito 1989, 1992))

          <text>3.  Covertness of QR vs. Overtness of &#8220;A-scrambling&#8221;
(24) If A-scrambling in Japanese and QR in English are the same rule, why is one overt and the
other covert?
(25) If we are to keep to our spirit of &#8220;scrambling is a routine operation,&#8221; this overt/covert
difference cannot be related to some unusual, &#8220;scrambling-specific&#8221; property of these
languages.
(26) Proposal:
The difference arises from an expanded version of Holmberg&#8217;s Generalization (Holmberg
1986, 1999, etc.)
(27) Object Shift cannot apply across a phonologically visible category asymmetrically c-
commanding the object position except adjuncts.  (Holmberg 1999)
Revised: An element (in VP) cannot move across a phonologically visible category
asymmetrically c-commanding it (except adjuncts).  (see recent work by Fox
and Pesetsky for related discussion)
(28) HG applies at PF (Holmberg 1999).
(29) Swedish:  V and Object Shift (Holmberg 1986)

OVERT MOVEMENT

(6) Covert and overt A-scrambling
The movement in (4b) and (5b) is the same:  A-scrambling. 
(7) A-scrambling:  A-movement (Mahajan 1990, Webelhuth 1989; cf. Saito 1992, Tada 1993).
(8) A-scrambling is EPP driven (Miyagawa 2001, in press).
(9) Overt vs. Covert:  different instructions to phonology -- pronounce the head (overt) or the
tail (covert) of the chain  (e.g.,  Bobaljik 1995, Fox and Nissenbaum 1999, Pesetsky 1998,
Groat and O&#8217;Neil 1996).
(10) QR is scrambling (Johnson and Tomioka 1997; cf. Hornstein 1995, Kitahara 1996 for
related discussion.)

4. Why Covert A-movement Apparently Only Targets Quantifiers (thus
&#8220;QR&#8221;)
(34) The EPP feature on v is optional.  How is it justified?
Movement triggered by an optional feature must have some effect on  output (scope,
informational structure, etc.)  (Fox 1995, 2000; Reinhart 1995; Chomsky 2001).
&#8226;Covert A-scrambling, being covert, perhaps can only meet this requirement by altering
scope relation; this is Fox's Scope Economy.
&#8226;Overt A-scrambling can affect, for example, informational structure (e.g., Ishihara
2001), which makes it possible for non-quantifier phrases to undergo A-scrambling.
(35) ACD resolution may involve quantifier movement to vP (Legate 2002).
(36) A possible alternative to (34) 
In English, the relevant operation only applies to quantifiers because the operation is
Quantifier Raising, not A-scrambling.
5.  Is There QR?
(37) QR for an object quantifier (or some other VP-internal quantifier) is required for addressing
a type mismatch.  Such a quantifier moves to vP, which is of the type that includes &lt;t&gt;.  
(38) vP is a (quasi-)proposition; QR targets vP (Bruening 2001, Fox 2000, Johnson and
Tomioka 1997, etc.)
(39) An alternative:  &#8220;pure&#8221; QR is to the local VP.
&#8226; VP is of the same type as vP
&#8226; External argument is an adjunct (Kratzer 1996)

          <text>(30) Swedish:  preposition, indirect object, verb particle (Holmberg 1999)
a.preposition
*Jag talade henne inte med to. a&#8217; Jag talade inte med henne.
Ispoke her not with I spoke not with her
b.indirect object
*Jag gav den inte Elsa to. b.&#8217; Jag gav inte Elsa den.
Igave it not Elsa I gave not Elsa it
c.verb particle
*Dom kastade mej inteut to.c.&#8217; Dom kastade inte ut mej.
they threw me notout they threw not out me
Prediction:  overt A-scrambling occurs in languages in which the verb, or some other relevant
element, does not block such overt movement.  Most commonly, such a language would be OV. 
But even in VO, shifting of the object should be allowed if V moves out of the way.

Kysst har jag henne inte(bara h&#229;llit hennei handen).

SCRAMBLING IS EVERYWHERE
Shigeru Miyagawa
MIT
Scrambling is not some special rule induced by some unusual property of a
language.
(1)  Unusual properties proposed in the literature:
a.non-configurational phrase structure (Hale 1983)
b.non-forced agreement (Kuroda 1988)
c.costless, featureless, purely optional movement (Fukui 1993, Saito &amp; Fukui
1998)
d.weak theta-marking feature (Boskovic and Takahashi 1998)
(2) Scrambling is motivated by some formal feature such as the EPP or some
semantic factor (Miyagawa 1995, 1997, 2002, 2003).  
&#8226;Scrambling is a typical, run of the mill movement.
&#8226;There are no &#8220;scrambling&#8221; and &#8220;non-scrambling&#8221; languages.
&#8226;Scrambling is everywhere.
&#8226;Scrambling in a non-scrambling language:  QR
1.   Overt vs. Covert Movement
(3) Overt vs. Covert movement:  wh-movement
a.What i did John buy ti

(46) Applicative head (cf. Marantz 1993), which selects the High Goal, is not a phase .  No EPP
feature to attract anything.  No overt (c/d above) or covert A-scrambling ((46)).   McGinnis
(2002) has independently concluded that the applicative head is not a phase.  
Further evidence that the applicative head is not a phase:  it does not block a QP from crossing it.

Problem: the EPP does not appear to hold of VSO languages: e.g., Irish/Celtic, Greek/Romance,
Arabic 
Romance/Greek: no overt expletive in the VS(O)
(1) a.O Petros pandreftike tin Ilektra. Greek 
Peter married Ilektra 
'Peter married Ilektra.' 
b. pandreftike o	Petros tin Ilektra 
married Peter Ilektra 
(2) Core observation
In these languages without an (overt) expletive (e.g., Greek), independently, the subject can bedropped ("pro-drop") (p. 494). 
(3) Proposal
These languages (e.g., Greek) satisfy the EPP by verb raising because they have verbalagreement morphology with the categorial status of a pronominal element. 
(4) Three predictions for these (e.g., Greek) languages:
(i)	 Pre-verbal subjects are not in an A-position
(ii)	 VSO orders never involve a covert expletive
(iii) pro-drop languages always have verb raising 
2. EPP
Greek/Spanish VSO type: two possibilities
(5) (i) proEXPL -- EPP is "strong" 
(ii)	 no expletive pro -- "weak/no" EPP; in SVO, S is in A'-position
[will adopt (ii), but EPP is strong]

          <text>(iii) Binding: only postverbal subject pronoun can be a bound variable (Spanish) (=A position)
(11) a.*Tots	 els estudiantsi es pensen que ellesi aprovaran.
all the students think that they pass 
b.	 Tots els jugadorsi estan convencus que guanyaran ellesi .
all the players are persuaded that win they
'All the players are persuaded that they are the ones who win.'
(Sol&#224; 1992, Barbosa 1994 -- only the postverbal subject is in A-position) 
VSO &#8800; pro expl VSO
 (12) 	 standard analysis of VSO: proexpl (Rizzi, 1982, Chomsky 1995) 
argument against this: no DR effect -- in Greek, postverbal subject may be a strong universal QP
(13) eftase ena pedi/o Jorgos/kathe filos mu. 
arrived a chid/George/ every friend mine 
'A child/George/every friend of mine arrived.' 
In transitive constructions DR effects are systematically absent in Greek, but present in Icelandic. 
(14)	 a. diavase ena pedi/kathe pedi to vivlio. (Greek)
read a child/every child book 
'A/every child read the book.' 
b. *Um n&#243;ttina	 hafdi [e] sokkid b&#225;turinn. (Icelandic)
in the night had sunk the boat
(15)	 DR effect: Chomsky (1995): expletive is D, its associate is NP.
Prediction: if a language has an expletive, the language will exhibit DR effects; if thereare no DR effects, the language lacks expletives. 
3. Proposal 
(16) Two possibilities for NSLs and VSO:
(i)	no/weak EPP;
(ii)	 strong EPP, EPP checked not by moving/merging an XP, but by V-movement. 
Adopt (ii):
One strong prediction: VSO languages are pro-drop languages 
(17) NSLs: verbal agreement morphology includes a nominal element:
[+D, +interpretable phi-features, potentially +Case], this D triggers the EPP
basically the agreement is pronominal 
(18) English Greek 
I love we love agapo agapame 
you love you love agapas agapate 
he loves they love agapa agapane 
(19) EPP feature checking is D-feature checking -- same in non-pro-dro and pro-drop
(20) EPP is universally strong - formal property of sentences that relates to the PF interface.

          <text>Lack of Spec, AgrSP in Greek/Spanish
(Evidence that XP merge for EPP does not exist; hence there is no proexpl) 
(evidence is for lack of A-position that would be the Spec of AgrSP) 
SVO: involves Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD) of the subject -- S in A' position: no Spec, Head
relation between the subject and the verb. 
(i) 	distribution: adverbs and other things may intervene between the subject and the verb
(6) a.O Petros xtes meta apo poles prospathies sinandise ti Maria 
Peter	 yesterday after from many efforts met Mary
'After many efforts, Peter met Mary yesterday.' 
b.	 Epidi o Petros an erthi i Maria tha figi.
because Peter if comes Mary FUT leave
'Because if Mary comes, Peter will leave.'
(ii) interpretation: 	subjects in SVO have unambiguously wide scope over object(A-movement does not affect the scope of a quantifier) 
(7)	a. Kapios fititis stihiothetise kathe arthro. S&gt;O, *O&gt;S (SVO) 
some student filed every article 
b. stihiothetise	 kapios fititis kathe arthro. S &gt; O, O&gt;S (VSO)
filed some student every article
(8)	a. #Enas oreos andras pandreftike kathe sinadelfo mu persi.
 a handsome man married every colleague mine last year
'A handsome many married every colleague of mine last year.' 
b. Persi	 pandreftike enas oreos andras kathe sinadelfo mu 
last year married 
Indefinite preverbal subject in Greek: strong (partitive/specific) reading (cf. the mappinghypothesis, Kratzer 1988, Diesing 1992)
(9)a.	 Ena pedhi diavase to 'Paramithi horis Onoma'. 
a	 child read the 'Fairy-tale without a title'
'A certain child/one of the children read 'Fairytale without a Title.' 
b. diavase ena pedhi to 'Paramithi horis Onoma' 
preverbal subject does not reconstruct (more like control structures)
(10) a.Ena	 pedhi prepi na parousiasi tin ergasia mextri to telos tis vdomadas. 
a child must Subj present the essay until the end of the week 
(only deontic reading available) 
b. prepi na	 parousiasi ena pedhi tin ergasia mextri to telos tis vdomadas. 
must Subj present a child the essay until the end of the week 
(epistemic reading available: "It must be the case that ...")

          <text>(21) 	 Why should there be two options to satisfy the EPP?
Overt V-movement is less costly -- V-movement does not extend the structure, hence more
economical in the sense of Economy of Projection (cf. Speas 1994, but in a different sense). 
V-raising in Non-Pro-Drop Languages 
(22) V-raising and the EPP:
V-raising for pro-drop: by the EPP. All pro-drop languages have V-raising.What about non-pro-drop languages? 
French: strong V feature of INFL attracts the verb. In pro-drop, it is strong D features inAGR. AGR only has D features while T has both V and N features (the latter for Case).

          <text>(6) Problem 
Weak island violations show up in certain cases even with argument wh-phrases.
(7)Two inter-related questions:
 (i)exactly what is being violated with weak islands (Rizzi's RM)?
(ii) exactly what is responsible for the (non-)referential nature of chains?
(8)Proposal for (i):  Quantifier-Induced Barriers (Beck 1995, 1996a, 1996b)
Proposal for (ii): Nature of chains and &#8220;referentiality&#8221; (e.g., Beck 1995, Cresti 1995, Lahiri
2002)
3.   How many X  and Quantifier-Induced Barrier
(9) How many people do you think I should talk to?
 (i) For what n: there are n-many people x , such that you think I should talk to x.
(outer reading)
(ii) For what n:  you think it should be the case that there be n-many people  that I talk
to? (inner reading)
(Cresti 1995; cf. also Lahiri 2002)
A description
(10) (At least for some wh-chains), if it is interpreted as presuppositional, all parts of the wh-
phrase are interpreted high in the structure, while if it is interpreted as non-
presuppositional, some relevant part of the wh-phrase is interpreted low in the structure.
(11) The inner reading (non-presuppositional) disappears in weak islands (Beck 1995, Cresti
1995):  an instance of a weak island effect with an argument wh
a.How many people do you wonder whether I should talk to?  (wh-island)
 (i) For what n: there are n-many people x, such that you wonder whether I should
talk to x.
(ii) * For what n:  you wonder whether it should be the case that there be n-many
people that I talk to?
b.Wieviele HundehatKarlnichtgef&#252;ttert?  (negative island)

 (i)For which n:  there are n dogs that Karl didn&#8217;t feed.

b. non-presuppositional
*for what n, .... [wh-island  ... n-many people  ...]
(21) What is the exact nature of the barrier effect induced by the wh-island?  Following Beck
(1996a) and Beck and Kim (1997), I will assume that any quantificational element
potentially induces a Quantifier-Induced Barrier.  
Suppose that in a wh-island, this is induced by the question morpheme Q that heads the CP of
the island.
(22) Q, which heads the CP in questions, induces a QUIB; hence the CP, which is a QUIB,
cannot intervene in a wh-chain in which some portion of the wh-phrase occurs below this
CP.
(23) Q is an existential quantifier (Karttunen's 1973; cf. Hagstrom 1998)

1.  Introduction
(1) Strong island:  for example, relative clause (e.g., Chomsky 1977, Ross 1967)
a.*What i do [ TP you know [ DP  the author who [ TP wrote t i]]]?
b. *Why i do [ TP  you know [ DP the man who [ TP  quit his job t i]]]?
Weak island
(2) Wh-island (Chomsky 1977)
a. What i do you wonder [whether to fix t i]? ARGUMENT WH EXTRACTION
b.*Why i do you wonder [whether to fix the car t i]? ADJUNCT WH EXTRACTION
(3) Negative island (Ross 1983)
a. Who i don't you think that John talked to t i? ARGUMENT WH EXTRACTION
b.*Why i don't you think that John talked to Mary t i? ADJUNCT WH EXTRACTION
(4) Empty Category Principle (Chomsky 1981), Relativized Minimality (Rizzi 1990),

Weak Island
(5) A.  Relativized Minimality
B. Differentiating between argument and adjunct extraction (Rizzi 1992; cf. also Cinque
1990, Rizzi 1990):  referentiality
X can carry a referential index only if it bears an argumental Theta role on some level
of representation. 
  (i)if X, a chain, bears a referential index, the head of the chain only needs to bind the
tail; 
(ii)if not, the head must govern the tail.

Jelinek (1984) NLLT article:
Some languages have obligatory pronominal arguments/clitics that count as arguments of the
verbs. Full NPs are never themselves arguments -- optional adjuncts of some kind.
Baker's re-statement:  (p. 108)
 In the presence of a pronominal element related to an argument position Y, an overt NP Z cannot
occupy position Y at S-structure.  Z can only be an adjunct to some constitutent from which it
binds Y.
...dislocation of NPs correlates with the presence of agreement almost perfectlyh in Mohawk,
since both are present in virtually every every structure.  (p. 108)
(1) 	A verb X agrees with an NP Y if and only if Y is in a dislocated adjunct position. (109) 
Kinande, a Bantu language. 
subject agreement required, but object agreement is optional
(2)	a. N-a-gul-a eritunda.

'I bought a fruit.' 
b. Eritunda, n-a-ri-gul-a.
fruit.5 1sg.S-T-OM5-buy-FV

When there is OM, the object, if there is one, must occur at the front of the sentence. 
(3)	a. N-a-(*ri)-gul-a eritunda.

'I bought a fruit.' 
b. Eritunda, n-a-*(ri)-gul-a.
fruit.5 1sg.S-T-OM5-buy-FV
'The fruit, I bought it.'
The agreed-with category must be interpreted as definite/specific. This is illustrated for the 
object below.

(5) &#8220;[t]rue polysynthetic languages&#8230;always have agreement and always have dislocation&#8221; (Ibid.,
p. 112). A higher Spec of TP, comparable to the dislocation position in Italian.  The 
agreement, therefore, occurs in a specifier higher than the normal Specifier of TP. 
Baker forces the agreed-with phrase to occur in a higher position &#8211; thus the agreement to hold 
between this higher specifier and some head &#8211; by requiring pro to occur in the &#8220;normal&#8221; Spec of TP (Ibid., p. 124). 
(6) [TP NP i [TP pro i T&lt;AGR i&gt;+Verb &#8230; [ VP ti&#8230;]]] 
Kinande allows non-subjects as well as subjects in the Spec of TP, and the verb agrees with 
whatever occurs there. 
(7) a.Omukali mo-a-seny-ire okukwi (lw&#8217;-omo-mbasa). 
woman.1 AFF-1.S/T-chop-EXT wood.11 LK11-LOC.18-axe.9

 b.  Olukwi si-lu-li-seny-a bakali (omo-mbasa). 
wood.11 NEG-11.S-PRES-chop-FV women.2 LOC.18-axe.9 
&#8216;WOMEN do not chop wood (with an axe).&#8217; 
Another kind of inversion is with the locative expression.  This construction is found with unaccusatives and passives of transitives. Unlike in English, in Kinande, there is agreement
between the locative expression and the verb. 
(8) ?Omo-mulongo mw-a-hik-a omukali.
 LOC.18-village.3 18.S-T-arrive-FV woman
 &#8216;At the village arrived a woman.&#8217;
Difference between English and Kinande: in English the locative is not in Spec, TP. 
(9) *Who i was on the wall hung a picture of t i?. 
(10) Who was there a picture of t i on the wall? 
The phrase that is &#8220;agreed-with&#8221; must occur on the left edge, where it is interpreted as definite/specific. One piece of evidence for this has to do with &#8220;augment vowels.&#8221; Nouns often begin with an &#8220;augment&#8221; vowel that matches the vowel of the class that the noun prefix belongs to. This augment vowel may drop under the scope of negation and in some other contexts; a noun without this augment vowel has a nonspecific, indefinite interpretation. The following 
exemplifies an object with and without its augment vowel.

Theory: 
(20) a. Agreement is not a distinct feature on a head. 
b. It must be packaged with an EPP feature or a Case feature. 
c. If Agr is packaged with one feature, it checks the head's other feature. 
(21) In Greek/Sp, Agr is packaged with the nominative case feature. It therefore checks the EPP 
feature. a is impossible because nothing triggers movement to Spec, TP. Same as A&amp;A - -
agreement feature on the Verb checks off the EPP feature. 
(22)	 In Bantu Agr is packaged with the EPP feature. It checks off the nominative case feature of T.  An NP that is attracted to Spec, TP, must be of the kind that has no Case feature to check -- it must be an empty pro. 
(23)	 Why is a possible in, e.g., English? That is, in non-pro-drop languages of IE. The few verbal agreement markers are either syntactically inert or are entirely absent in the syntax and added in the postsyntactic morphology (cf. Halle and Marantz 1993).

(12) Summary 
Local scrambling: A-scrambling 
LD scrambling:  A&#8217;-scrambling 
1.1.2. 	 Confirmation: anaphor binding 
(13) Local scrambling: 	can create a new binder through A-movement

1.2. EPP and Scrambling (Miyagawa 2001, 2003; cf. also Collins 1997, Kitahara 2002) 
Miyagawa (2001, 2003)

(24) 	 A quantifier is in the scope of negation iff it is c-commanded by negation 
(cf. Klima 1964) 
The position of negation is roughly as proposed by Laka (1990), Pollock (1989).

vP 
v&#8217; 
VP  V-mo- v 
nani-o tV 
(37) 	 Indeterminate pronoun in the subject position is ungrammatical 
*Dare-ga piza-o tabe- mo sina-kat-ta.
 who-Nom pizza-Acc eat-MOdo-Neg-Past
 &#8216;Anyone didn&#8217;t eat pizza.&#8217;
Kishimoto assumes the EPP here, and argues that the subject indeterminate pronoun dare 
&#8216;who&#8217; raises to the Spec of TP to satisfy the EPP of T, and this takes it outside the scope 
of mo, which is on v. According to the analysis I&#8217;m pursuing, the relevant portion of the 
structure of (37) is the following. 
(38)	 CP 
C&#8217; 
TP  C FOCUS

          <text>(52) 	 John read a book yesterday. 
Neeleman and Reinhart (1998) point out that scrambling allows a given phrase to move 
away from the position of nuclear stress.  In the following Dutch example, the phrase that 
bears the nuclear stress is in bold. 
(53)	 Dat Jan langzaam het boek las 
that John slowly the  book read 
(54)	 Dat Jan het  boek langzaam las 
that John the  book slowly read 
The following are taken from Ishihara (2000) (Ishihara assumes V-raising to T). 
(55)	 a. Taroo-ga [ VP hon-o t v] katta. 
Taro-Nom [ VP book-Acc t v] bought 
b. Hon-o i Taroo-ga [ VPti tv] katta
book-Acc i Taro-Nom [ VPti tv] bought
(56)	 a. Taroo-ga kyoo hon-o katta. 
Taro-Nom today book-Acc bought 
b. Hon-o i Taroo-ga kyoo ti katta.
book-Acc Taro-Nom today t i bought
(57)	 Focus Rule 
The focus of IP is a(ny) constituent containing the main stress of IP, as 
determined by the stress rule (=nuclear stress rule).
(58)	 Taroo-ga [ VP hon-o t v] katta 
Taro-Nom [ VPbook-Acc t v] bought 
(59)	 a. What happened? (focus on IP) 
b. What did Taro do? (focus on VP) 
c. What did Taro buy? (focus on object) 
(60)	 Hon-o i Taroo-ga [ VP ti tv] katta 
book-Acc i Taro-Nom [ VP ti tv] bought 
No focus on VP, hence cannot answer &#8220;What did Taro do?&#8221;

4. Informational Focus and Nuclear Stress
Two types of focus: 
Identificational: 
Informational: topic-focus 
In the absence of identificational focus, &#8220;focus&#8221; on T picks out an XP and marks it as &#8220;topic&#8221;. This XP moves to Spec of TP for the EPP. This creates the topic-focus structure. 
In the absence of identificational focus, the focus stress rule is nuclear stress. 
Nuclear Stress Rule:  nuclear stress falls on the phrase located lowest on the syntactic tree 
(Cinque (1993), cf. Chomsky and Halle (1968) and Halle and Vergnaud (1987))
