What cost to assign to flight cancellations and flight
delays?
/GBEObjective coefficients are fixed in the ARM but in actual
operations they actually depend on the overall solution,
for example:
Postponing a flight departure might reduce overhead crew
cost and passenger delays and or conversely might disruptcrews and increase total passenger delay
A flight cancellation can benefit the passengers and reduce
airline operating cost or conversely a flight cancellation canresult in severe overhead costs to the airline

solution is highly sensitive to the objective coefficients</text>

The ARM would chose either decision #1 or #2 depending on
the flight delay and cancellation cost coefficients:
/GBEThe best decision for the passengers will never be
chosen by ARM
/GBEPassenger direct operating costs not capture; overnight
passengers create extra direct costs for the airline (e.g.,
hotels) and potential lost revenues

When capacity shortage is too large, ATCSCC issue
a GDP to prevent airborne holding of arriving aircraft.
(safety, workload, fuel)
Instead, aircraft are better off waiting on the ground
Example: Yesterday in BOS: Due to EQUIPMENT, RY
4R GS OTS/LOW CIGS/VSBY, there is a TrafficManagement Program in effect for traffic arriving
BOS. This is causing some arriving flights to be
delayed an average of 1 hour and 3 minutes withsome arriving flights receiving as much as 1 hourand 38 minutes delay.

complex multi layer plan at a given time:
/GBE30 minutes flight delay may result in crew disruption, flight
cancellations and severe passenger disruptions. The effect
can last for more than a day
/GBEConversely, a 30 minutes delay might benefit crews and
passengers as both would have been disrupted had theflight departed on time
