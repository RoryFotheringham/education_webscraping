          <text>Energy
Total energy use for buildings in developed 
nations at an historical high.
Overwhelming reliance on fossil, nonrenewable 
fuels.
Little domestic incentive to reduce energy 
consumption by buildings.
Little domestic incentive to  increase material use 
efficiency.
Facts:
Buildings now account  for   of energy 
consumption  in the western world.
Buildings now account for 1/3  of energy 
consumption in the entire world.
 of the worlds energy output is consumed by  
of the worlds population.
70 % of  domestic (U.S.)  materials consumption

Relatively Low R&amp;D inve stment by construction 
related Industries
Continuing underestimation of the level of

          <text>Stude nt Wor k: Integr ated Buildi ng SystemsAverage time period necessary fo r a technical advance (from lab) to reach market = 17 years in 
the U.S.
Easier (in terms of regulatory hurdles) to in sert new materials into the human body than into 
buildings. 
For every $1 of laborato ry research conducted, 
$10 must by spent for proof of co ncept and product development and, 
$100 dollars must be spent for indust rial retooling and market entry.
Average level of Research and Development for all U.S. indust ries approaches 5% of gross 
revenue.
The construction industry only inve sts 0.5% of annual gross revenue.
Currently the construction industry in the U.S. acc ounts for 8% of annual GDP.

          <text>Part I: Course Outline
Principles 
1. Cultu ral Context : Tec hnology  exists  within a cultural 
contex t. Therefore, contem porary  building tec hnology  
derives  of a rich his torical and cultural evol ution of 
technique and for m that augme nts the abi lity to desi gn 
intelligen tly.
2. Holistic Building : Unders tanding individual building 
components and the detai ls necessitates  unders tanding 
the guiding architec tural intentions , performance 
requirements, process  of manufac ture and ass embly , 
and sys tematic  organization of various  building 
assemblies.
3. Inven tion: Architec tural inven tion is the medi um for the 
determi nation of form at all scales  and permeates the 
physical architectural resul t. The maki ng of detai ls is not 
a deter ministic process  that seeks to optimize a singular  
solution. Be careful of optimi zation. Il ny a pas de detai l

Using LCA, the following is 
a comparison of 
structural materials  for 
on-site construction of 
an assembly.
Construction energy and 
grreenhouse gas 
emissions were 
examined in five 
general categories:
1.Transportation of the 
constructi on crew to 
and from the site.
2.Transportation of 
materials  to the site
3.Transportation of 
equipment to and from 
the site.
4.Use of on-site 
equipment.
5.Supporting processes, 
such as from-work and

 Material Properties and 
Applications of various 
steels
Carbon steels
Carbon steel s are di viedinto four 
categories  depending on the 
percentage of carbon:
 Low carbon: less  than 
0.15%
 Mild carbon: 0.15-0.29
 Medium c arbon: 0.30-0.59%
 High carbon: 0.60-1.70%
Structural carbon steels are i n the 
mild category : A36 has  max . 
carbon from 0.25-0.29%. 
Increased carbon percent 
raises  the yield s tress but 
reduces  ductility  and m akes 
welding more difficult. 100

Material Properties and Applications

Corrosion
Self-weathering s teels have been widely 
adopted for  conditions  in which the sur face 
of the s teel is expos ed to the weather. 
These s teels are ty pically A588 for  
buildings and A709 for  bridges .
Several rul es are important to note:
1.For optimum per formance in the unpainted 
condition, the s tructure should be boldly 
exposed to the weather .
2.The development of the pr otective oxide 
film is  best achiev ed under  normal 
exposur e, wherein the sur faces  are wet at 
night by dew formati on and dry duri ng 
daylight hours .
3.Because this wet-dry  cycle cannot occur  
when the s teel, regar dless of its  grade, is  
buried  in the soil or immersed in wate r, the 
protective o xide will no t form and the 
performance will rese mble that of mild  
steel carbon exposed t o the same 
conditions . Image by MIT OCW.10

High-strength low-alloy steels
The addition to ca rbon steels of 
small amounts  of alloy  
elements  such as  chromium, 
colum bium, copper, 
manganese, molybdenum, 
nickel, phosphor ous, 
vanadium, zirconium 
improves some of the 
mechanical proper ties. 
Additional s trength is  obtained 
through a fine-grained 
crystalline mic rostructure as  
opposed to the course 
graining of simple carbon 
steel.

The heat tr eatment consists  of 
quenching [ rapid cooling

 Introduction
The use of wood extends back in time 
longer than any other 
material. In fact, wood 
represents both the original 
material of building as well as 
the earliest source of energy. 
Once abundant i t is now , for 
the most part a m anaged 
resource.   
whether  to use the wood to build 
a small shelter  or as 
firewood for  a bonfire. An 
entire theor y of 
architec ture is  
encapsulated in this  
simple ques tion.

Part IV: Re source Efficie ncy and other sustainable issue s
Issues
1. Harvesti ng
 Deforestation: in the US, rate of f orest growth far exceeds rate of harvest
 Habitat destruction: primar y national forest issue
 Fragmentation of natural habit ats: lately identified as major contributor to large 
floral and fauna population swings
 Biodiversity: also importa nt in the national forests
2. Indoor environ mental issues
 Off-gassing from formaldehy de composites. Architects should specify products that 
meet ANSI/HPVA HP-1 or comply with US HUD formaldehyde requirement. (see 
the Ameri can Insti tute of Architects: Environmental Resource Guide). All glul ams
use adhesives that contain formaldehyde, although re sorcinol-formaldehyde and 
phenol-resorcinol formaldehy de are considered safe. Urea form aldehyde is not.
 Preservatives, whil e not p roven to cause health hazard s, should be completely 
isolated from the interior spaces of bu ildings. Try to avoi d using preservatives 
altogether. Good detailing can mitigate most weathering issues.
 Trapped moisture from green w ood can promote mold gro wth within an exterior 
envelope assembly. Good exterior wall analysis will prevent m anymoisture 
probl ems.</text>

Issues
3. Energy
 Energy com parisons (i n the US) between various materi als shows that wood is 
very resource efficient (units omitted, only relative energy  costs shown). For 
example, aluminum requires 12 6 % more energy than wood.
 In addition, using fa st growing trees (reach ing maturation within  20 years; southern 
pine, poplar) it is possibl e to remove more carbon from the en vironment than one 
has released in the amount of energy used to harvest and produce lumber
 However, there is a great deal of material waste in th e production of standardized 
sections for construction. Th e production of 2 x 4s from a single log will result in 
about 35% waste wood, in th e form of shavings, unus able sections, sawdust and 
chips.Type of W all Energ y

Issues
4. Production - Rating Council s: Certification is rare 
and not particularly reliable outside of the United 
States
 ISO 14001 (ISO)
 Sustainable Forestry Initiative Standard 
(SFI)
 Canadas National Sustainable Forest 
Management System (CSA)
 The American Tree Farm Program (ATF)
 The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)
However: 
 Only about 1% of the worlds wood 
resources are certified (US is net 
importer of wood)
 Enforcement of fore ign sources of wood 
is close to impossible
 Tagging certification strategies are 
problematic on many fronts
5. Sustainable Practices
 See article
 Simply do not specify exotic woods 
(mahogany, teak, ebony, anigre)
 Seek out sources of recovered, 
reclaimed wood (James Cutler, Gates 
house)
 Specify glulams, lvls, osb, non-
formaldehyde plywood (more resource efficient production), mdf and engineered sections

-Outer glazed skin consists 
of 2.7m wide and 1.13 high laminated glass (6 + 8mm glass panes) which is fixed to the transoms of the faade frames via pressure caps recessed in the glass
-Inner skin consists of a 
premanufactured storey-high frame elements of aluminum and low-e coated glass
-The cavity is 0.7m wide-The wall does not ventilate 
the interior space because of the surrounding fumes from traffic. Its primary function is as a noise buffer from that  traffic.
-Fully air-conditioned 
buildingOffice Building, 
Leon/Wohlhage, 1996.Halensee, Berlin, Germany
-Functions like a story-high 
solar collector
-Constructed directly on a 
busy highway
-Cavities are one story tall 
and separated by a bent concrete parapet
-Outer layer is completely 
closed yielding a very good noise buffer. The cavity is 0.85m wide.
-Winter: cavity remains 
closed and serves as a thermal buffer
-Summer: the inner layer 
remains closed and the cavity is ventilated-During the swing seasons, the 
occupants can open the inner 
layer and bring in fresh air as desired
- To reduce cooling loads during 
the summer the concrete structure is cool ed at night and 
used as thermal storageHeadquarters
Gotz, Webler + Geissler, Architect.
-DSF used in conjunction with a 
central atrium to regulate the 
thermal resistance and the cooling load for the building
- Also air is mechanically 
circulated horizontally from one side of the building to the other to take advantage of solar gain RWE Essen Tower
C. Ingerhoeven, 1999.
Tower 34m in diameter
130 m high
-High thermal resistance of 
faade led to minimization of cooling loads.
-DSF allows for windows to 
be opened through the use of a wind pressure buffer at the base of the windows at each floor.
-Exposed concrete used for 
thermal mass.
-- Cooling supplied by 
hydronic radiant panels in ceiling.
-- Heating supplied by

-Outer pane is 10mm heat 
absorbing glass pane, placed 120 cm in front of the actual building skin
-Winter: warmed air is 
directed to a heat exchanger at roof
-Summer: air is brought to 
roof and exhausted-External glazing of insulated 
glass and low-e coating. Internal glazing designed as a sliding door and gives access to the cavity for cleaning
-Ventilated cavity is 14cm 
wide
-Air from room enters at floor 
level and is mechanically ventilated through cavity
-DSF increases the thermal 
resistance of the wall during the winter months and allows for the management of solar gain during the summer-External pane is 12mm single

 Insulation :
- Especially between premanufactured assemblies
such as mullion curtainwall systems and 
surrounding building fabric.
 Thermal capacity :
- No significant use as a thermal capacity medium 
(lightweight nature makes its temperature swing 
quite rapid). However, PCMs may change this.
 Airtightness :
- Due to differential movement between the
lightweight cladding and the adjacent materials,
need to insure continuity of a membrane material
(most commonly EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene-terpolymer).

Current Issues
1. Very little real building behavior data. Claims of energy consumption savings of 30% have NOT 
been verified.
2. US office standards call for deeper perimeter office depths (15-20m typical) than in Europe (7m)
making cross ventilation difficult.
3. US humidity levels, especially in the East, Midwest and South may make the use of natural
ventilation through DSFs difficult. Also a potential problem with chilled ceilings.
4. Cost premium of the wall can be in excess of 200-300% of a typical insulated curtainwall. With 
realistic payback periods of 20 or so years, the capital costs are currently prohibitive for large 
scale use. Even in Europe, these technologies require substantial subsidies. 
5. Usually better, less expensive ways exist to reduce energy consumption.
6. Difficult to shift load to account for large swings in populations. For example theater audiences.7. Systems call for heightened control mon itoring and careful adjustments made within an 
integrated  strategy. Training of building personnel critical.
8. Anecdotal evidence that Americans in the workplace have a tighter comfort zone than many 
Europeans.</text>

Acoustics Contributors to a windows 
sound insulation potential are its:
1. Mass2. Air-tightness
3. The gap width of the 
window cavity
4. Acoustical isolation of 
the absorbent material around the edges of the air space
Each doubling of glass thickness, sound 
insulation is increased by about 4dB
Good performance corresponds to 
providing sound insulation of over 40 dB
A good air gap (for acoustics) has a 
width of at least 150mm
Best thermal air gap is around 20mm
Therefore, optimization is required</text>

MATERIALSDesign and Construction
 Insulation :insulation must be installed as a continu ous layer to be effective as calculated. It has been 
estimated that gaps in insulation account for 6% of overall envelope area in commercial buildings. This
discontinuity can amount to 33% additional heat loss. Thermal bridges and impossible insulating details
are systemic problems of the building industry.
 Thermal capacity :by storing excess heat in winter and absorbing heat gains in summer, to be 
rejected using free-cooling techniques during the night.
 Airtightness :Very large amounts of energy is lost through air leakage. In addition to the energy loss,
air leakage is also the primary source of water condensation in the exterior envelope assembly,leading to 
durability problems. Measurements have shown th at air leakage can typically move 100 times more
moisture into an envelope assembly than would occur by diffusion alone. Also, air leakage can contribute
to problems of indoor air quality (IAQ) from the unfiltered air. Finally, air leakage contributes to uneven temperatures within the building and can lead to complaints of draughts and difficulties in achievinguniform indoor temperatures.
 Envelope Details to serve above :Details that address the coordination of the trades and the 
specific areas most often cited as problems points should be carefully considered by the architect and 
then followed up by the contractor. The following are suggestions to achieve these goals:
1. Inclusion of air locks at entries
2. During Design Development (Detail Design) the line of barrier materials, air and water, should be 
completely traced by the design team. Any discontinuities should be addressed.
3. Quality assurance: At completion, both air leakage testing and thermographic imaging may be 
undertaken to assure the owner of a well-built wall.HVAC Strategies for Well-

 Insulation :
- thermal bridging occurs primarily at door 
and window interfaces. Continuous sealant 
and proprietary cavity closures (as part of 
window and door assembly) are necessaryhere.
 Thermal capacity :
- As a result of the non-structural nature of 
much of masonry construction, its use as a 
thermal capacity material is limited.
 Airtightness :
- Inner wythe usually serves as air barrier, although 
gypsum board or finish plaster may also serve 
such a function. (Problems above dropped 
ceilings when finish is not continuous).
- Continuous mortar beds and end joints standard. 
 Envelope Details to serve above :
- Pre-formed insulted lintels should be used over 
window and door openings in cavity masonry construction.
- Cavity closures should be incorporated whenever 
the cavity is interrupted.</text>

Goal of assembly
1. Reduce impact of solar rad iation on building climate and control
2. Increase thermal resistance of exterior envelope from third leaf layer and through heat 
removal from convection within the cavity and diminished heat transfer owing to the 
increased temperature of the cavity air
3. Provide controlled daylighting4. Provide a good acoustic barrier
5. Provide greater occupant control of microclimate especially as a means of opening 
windows even in a high rise building
6. Reduce load needed to be serviced by HVAC equipment. There is the potential to 
eliminate equipment entirely, including ductwork, however for the most part this has benvery difficult to achieve realistically (issues of real estate value).
7. Reduce wind pressure on weather envelope

Temperature difference between inside and outside panes 
results in thermal exp/contr that could stress the assembly
Spacers are necessary in the glass cavity to avoid inward

Terminology
 Absolute humidity :ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total volume of the air sample.
 Humidity ratio :ratio of mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air contained in the sample.
 Specific humidity :ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the dry air.
 Relative humidity :the ratio, at a specific temperature, of the moisture content of the air sample if it 
were at saturation, and the actual moisture content of the air sample. Given as a percentage.
 Water vapor pressure :the partial pressure exerted by the vapor at a given temperature.
 Water vapor permeance (permeance coefficient): the time rate of water vapor transmission 
through unit area of flat product induced by unit water vapor pressure difference between its surfaces.
 Water vapor permeability :the time rate of water vapor transmission through unit area of flat material

 Water vapor resistance and resistivity :the reciprocals of permeance and permeability.
 Hygrothermal material : a material that will absorb moisture.
In principal, any transport process is brought about by a driving force or a potential. 
Gas diffusion and liquid transport as a consequence of capillary forces are 
considered here.</text>

4-7% of developed nation energy
consumption is due to heat losses from domestic glazings alone.
In EC countries, at least one-quarter of the domestic heating bill is due to 
the thermal energy loss through 
glazings because they are theweakest thermal component in the exterior envelope.
Recently, higher levels of insulation,lower infriltration rates and larger areas of glazed aperture are requiredin the design of buildings.
Use of double-glazed windows most common method of providing a 
reasonable level of thermal
resistance.
However, the edge-seal creates a thermal bridge between internal and external environments.Muneer, T. Abodahab, N.,
