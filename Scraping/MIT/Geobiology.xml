Fig. 2. Schematic depiction of effects of changing ocean redox conditions on the depth 
distributions of Mo (dashed lines) and Fe (solid lines). Influences of nutrient- type depletion and 
aeolian inputs on surface seawater concentrations are omitted for simplicity. Color gradations are the same as in Fig. 1. During the Archean, oceans are anoxic but not sulfidic. Significant O2 is onlassociated with cyanobacterial blooms. Mo is scarce because it is not readily mobilized from crustal rocks during weathering under low PO2. Fe is abundant in the absence of O2 and H2S. From 1850 to 1250 Ma, moderate PO2 oxygenates surface waters but sulfidic deep waters  
develop. Mo is scarce because of rapid removal in sulfidic waters. Mo is somewhat elevated at thesurface because of upper ocean oxygenation and enhanced oxidative weathering. Fe, as in the modern Black Sea, is depleted in sulfidic deep waters, severely depleted in oxic surface waters, and enriched near the redoxcline where both O2 and H2S are scarce. During the Phanerozoic, O2penetrates to the sediment- water interface. Mo and Fe distributions are similar to todays. See

High-resolution chemostratigraphy reveals an episode of enrichment of the redox-sensitive
transition metals molybdenum and rhenium in the late Archean Mount McRae Shale in Wes-tern Australia. Correlations with organic carbon indicate that these metals were derived fromcontemporaneous seawater. Rhenium/osmium geochronology demonstrates that the enrichm-ent is a primary sedimentary feature dating to 2501   8 million years ago (Ma). Molybdenum and rhenium were probably supplied to Archean oceans by oxidative weathering of crustal sulfide minerals. These findings point to the presence of small amounts of O
2 in the environ-
ment more than 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxidation Events.   +-

          <text>Abstract 
A rise in atmospheric O2 has been linked to the Cambrian explosion of life. For the plankton and animal radiation that began some 40 million yr later and continued through much of the Ordovician (Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event), the search for an environmental trigger(s) has remained elusive. Here we present a carbon and sulfur isotope mass balance model for the latest Cambrian time interval spanning the globally recognized Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (SPICE) that indicates a major increase in atmospheric O2. We estimate that this organic carbon and pyrite burial event added approximately 19 
 1018 moles of O2 to the atmosphere (i.e., equal to change from an initial 
starting point for O2 between 10 18% to a peak of 2028% O2) beginning at 
approximately 500 million years. We further report on new paired carbon isotope 
results from carbonate and organic matter through the SPICE in North America, Australia, and China that reveal an approximately 2 increase in biological fractionation, also consistent with a major increase in atmospheric O2. The SPICE is followed by an increase in plankton diversity that may relate to changes in macro- and micronutrient abundances in increasingly oxic marine environments, 
representing a critical initial step in the trophic chain. Ecologically diverse plankton groups could provide new food sources for an animal biota expanding into progressively more ventilated marine habitats during the Ordovician, ultimately establishing complex ecosystems that are a hallmark of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.

 Figure 8. Range of carb and CO2 values (open boxes) and org values (shaded boxes), 
together with the processes proposed to explain their distribution prior to 2.2 Ga and subsequent to 2.1 Ga. A temperature of 15C was assumed for the isotopic equilibrium between 
carb and CO2. The lines associated with the various groups of autotrophic bacteria and 
algae illustrate the maximum discrimination expected for each group. The sloped line at right 
depicts declining discrimination over time, perhaps in response to declining CO2 levels.

Figure 1. Biogeochemical C cycle, showing principal C reservoirs (boxes) in the mantle, crust, oceans and 
atmosphere, and showing the processes (arrows) that unite these reservoirs. The range of each of these reservoir boxes along the horizontal axis gives a visual estimate of 13C values most typical of each reservoir. 
The vertical bars at right indicate the timeframes within which C typically completely traverses each of the four 
C sub-cycles (the HAB, SED, MET and MAN sub-cycles, see text). For example, C can traverse the hydrosphere-atmosphere-biosphere (HAB) sub-cycle typically in the time scale between 0 to 1000 years.

 Figure 7. The biogeochemical C cycle prior to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, showing 
the much lower global primary productivity and the higher rates of thermal emanation of C (see text). Comparison with Figure 5 illustrates the enhancement of global primary productivity due to 
the development of oxygenic photosynthesis. Flux estimates are highly approximate, and are 
shown principally to illustrate the direction and magnitude of change over geologic time.

buried as organic matter. The vertical separation between the lines depicts , and thus reflects 
the combined effects of equilibria between inorganic C species and biological isotope 
discrimination (see text). A value TOC = 30 is depicted here, and represents the long-term 
average value during the past 800 Ma (Hayes et al. 1999). The vertical line represents the value 
of forg = 0.2, which represents the current value for the global C cycle.

(DeNiro and Epstein, 1977; Monson and Hayes, 1980,  
1982; reviewed Hayes, 2001)  
Reactions occur between molecules but isotope selectivity is 
expressed as chemical bonds that are made or broken at particular carbon positions. 
Isotope effects pertain to those specific positions and control 
fractionations only at that reaction site, not throughout the whole molecule. 
To calculate changes in the isotopic compositions of whole 
molecules we must first calculate the change at the site and then allow for the rest of the molecule because the isotopic shift is diluted by mixing with carbon that is just along for the ride..Hayes, 2002

 Figure 5. Plot of age versus carb (crosses) and org for Archean and Proterozoic kerogens. 
Kerogen data (filled circles) are corrected for the effects of thermal alteration (Des Marais 
1997a). Uncorrected data are shown as open circles. Between 2.2 to 2.0 billion years ago, note 
the high carb values and the virtual disappearance thereafter of org values more negative 
than -36. Other evidence indicates that atmospheric O2 increased substantially at this time (see 
text).

          <text>What are mass extinctions? 
A mass  extinction  is any substantial  increase  in the 
amount  of extinction  (i.e. lineage  termination)  suffered  
by more  than one geographically  widespread  higher  
taxon  during  a relatively  short interval of geologic  
time,  resulting  in an at least  temporary  decline in their 
standing  diversity .

          <text>Characteristics of Permian-Triassic Event 
Global regression of seal level; aggregation of supercontinent of 
Pangea; rarity of continuous sedimentation 
 
Massive volcanism and emplacement of Large Igneous Provinces 
(LIPS) - 400 to 3700m thick basalts over ca 5 Ma 
 
Uneven marine extinction; sessile animals worst hit 
 
Immediate radiation of different physiological groups (disaster 
species??) than before and then stabilization of the classic 
Mesozoic fauna and flora.

          <text>PTB Summary 
 
Extinction selectively killed sessile organisms with calcareous 
skeletons; vertebrates less affected 
Recovery was very protracted  &gt; 10 million years 
Biomarker  and isotopic evidence for deep ocean euxinia across 
P-T 
Multiple excursions in d13Ccarb , d13Corg, d15Norg, d34Spyrite near  
boundary 
These anomalies indicate there were major, long-term changes 
in the redox state of the ocean and a long-term disruption of 
the C-cycle 
Evidence for near-surface euxinia at PTB from 5 localities  
Tethys and Panthalassic were euxinic   compelling extinction 
mechanism

          <text>Extreme Panspermia?  
An email once received 
Dr. Roger Summons 
Committee on The Origins and Evolution of Life 
National Academy of Sciences 
  
Dear Dr. Summons: 
  
Individual solar systems safeguarded from supernova by vigilant intelligent life, 
and those (in the absence of intelligent life) destined for supernova, are 
interrelated in the infinite continuum of life:  the former an achievement of 
compassionate reciprocity, the latter vital to life processes through eventual 
production of chemical elements essential to life. 
  
Particularly persuasive in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), planets 
secured again! st supernova are a signature of intelligent life - as beneficiaries of 
steady-state energy supplied by host stars.  
  
Compassionate reciprocity - setting the standard for life-centered cosmologies - 
complements the strong version of panspermia (Cosmic Ancestry).

Abstract #U51A-10 The Hadean Atmosphere  Zahnle, K 
It is more useful to define the Hadean Eon as the time when impacts 
ruled the Earth than to define it as the time before the rock record. For 
decades now it has been obvious that the coincidence between the 
timing of the end of the lunar late bombardment and the appearance of 
a rock record on Earth is probably not just a coincidence. I doubt I am 
pointing out something that the reader hasn't long ago given thought 
to.  While the Moon was struck by tens of basin-forming impactors 
(100 km objects making 1000 km craters), the Earth was struck by 
hundreds of similar objects, and by tens of objects  much larger still. 
The largest would have been big enough to evaporate the oceans, and 
the ejecta massive enough to envelope the Earth in 100 m of rock rain. 
Smaller impacts were also more frequent. On average, a Chicxulub 
fell every 105 years. When one imagines the Hadean one imagines it 
with craters and volcanos: crater oceans and crater lakes, a scene of 
mountain rings and island arcs and red lava falling into a steaming sea 
under an ash-laden sky.

 The story so far: 
 
Our solar system formed from a disc of dust and gas about 4.6 billion years ago. 
 
Some of the components, especially elements larger than iron incl. radionuclides, were 
formed in earlier massive star systems (Supernovae) that exploded and spewed debris 
into the interstellar medium. 
 
Dense, less volatile materials (metals, silicate minerals) accumulated closer to the sun 
and accreted in violent collisions to form molten (rocky) planets. More volatile 
substances (eg ices) accumulated at the outer edges 
 
The inner planets, and especially the Earth, cooled and differentiated early. We now 
recognise  this in the separation of core, mantle and crust. Earths oversized moon 
formed as a result of a late impact with a Mars-sized planet 
 
Volatile materials not lost during the accretion process, combined with some material 
from  comets and other impactors, to form an early hydrosphere and atmosphere 
 
Earth cooled more slowly than other inner planets (eg Mars) and is tectonically active 
due to interior heat generation by radioactivity.  This activity has contributed to retention 
of the atmosphere and hydrosphere.

          <text>U51A-01 Habitability of Terrestrial Planets in the 
             Early Solar System SLEEP, N H 
It is unknown whether significant amounts of this gas were present when the 
Earth's surface cooled into the habitable range. The moon remained 
sterile because its interior is essentially devoid of  water . The mantle of 
the Earth, in contrast, cannot ho
ld the available water, leaving the excess to 
form oceans. Nitrogen may behave similarly with the excess going into the 
air. Impacts of large asteroids (and comets) were an ever-present danger on 
otherwise habitable planets. The safest niche on planets was a kilometer 
or deeper crustal rocks habitable by thermophiles . It is inevitable that 
several objects,  which would have left only thermophile survivors, struck 
the Earth. Such events were so infrequent that the conditions of such a 
bottleneck should not be confused with conditions for the origin of life. An 
alternative refugium involves ejection of life within rock fragments  and 
return of such fragments to the surface of the home planet or transfer to 
another habitable planet. Mars and the larger asteroids were habitable 
first and provide likely sources of seed and also testable places to look for 
preserved evidence. Extant terrestrial life appears to have passed 
through  thermophile bottlenecks . There are subtle hints of space 
transfer. The need of extant life for Ni may be vestige of life on a young 
planet covered with ultramafic rocks.

U51A -10 The Hadean Atmosphere  Zahnle, K 
I don't know about the volcanos, but the picture of abundant impact 
craters makes good sense --the big ones, at least, which feature several 
kilometers of relief, are not likely to have eroded away on timescales 
of less than ten million years, and so there were always several of 
these to be seen at any time in various states of decay. The oceans 
would have been filled  with typically hundreds of meters of 
weathered ejecta, most of which was ultimately subducted but taking 
with them whatever they reacted with at the time --CO2 was especially 
vulnerable to this sort of scouring. The climate, under a faint sun and 
with little CO2to warm it, may have been in the median extremely 
cold, barring the intervention of biogenic greenhouse gases (such as 
methane), with on occasion the cold broken by brief (10s to 1000s of 
years) episodes of extreme heat and steam following the larger 
impacts. In sum, the age of impacts seems sufficiently unlike the more 
familiar Archaean that came after that it seems useful to give this time 
its own name, a name we already have, and that, if applied to the 
Hadean that I have described, actually has some geological value.

          <text>A Hyperthermophilic Beginning for Life? 
Given the inhospitable surface environment on Earth &gt;3.8 
Ga, when the intense bombardment likely melted the crust &amp; 
vaporized the ocean, perhaps repeatedly, it is frequently 
proposed that life began in a sub-surface environment, 
perhaps a hydrothermal system where hot water, CO2 &amp; a 
variety of metals are readily available. 
 
The recognition that many of the essential enzymes for life 
require metals common in hydrothermal settings (Fe, Ni, 
Mo, Cu, Co, Zn) supports this supposition.

Planetary perspective on life on early Mars and the early Earth 
by Dr. Norman Sleep 
http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/workshops/1996/astrobiology/speakers/sleep/sleep_index.html  
 Biological evidence 
Life may root in thermophile on Earth - one or more almost sterilizing events  
Possible Martian fossils come from safe subsurface environment   
Space transfer 
Unshocked Mars meteorites fall today on the Earth  
Current transfer rate is 107-108 rocks per million years  
10-4 of rocks arrive within 10,000 years of impact  
Rate of transfer of fresh rocks is 104 per million years  
Early solar system rate 103 higher  
Billions of fresh rocks transferred   
Conclusions 
Subsurface of Mars was safer from the Earth  
Space transfer of organisms seems feasible  
There is biological evidence for partial sterilization of the Earth  
Space transfer of life to Earth is a viable possibility

          <text>Ribose 
 Evidence for an "RNA world," an episode of life on Earth during 
which RNA was the only genetically encoded component of 
biological catalysts, is found in the ribosome ,  catalytic RNA 
molecules,  and contemporary metabolism.  That RNA could form spontaneously and persist under prebiotic conditions 
has been doubted, however . Ribose  and its sister pentoses
(arabinose, xylose, and lyxose) are made under 
alkaline conditions from simple organic precursors 
(formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde) kno wn in interstellar 
space and presumably available on early Earth.  Pentoses 
do not accumulate under these conditions, however; they 
rapidly decompose in a "browning" reaction to gene
rate largely 
undescribable polymeric mixtures.  Ricardo, A., M. A. Carrigan, A. N. Olcott, and S. A.

U51A-01 Habitability of Terrestrial Planets in the 
             Early Solar System SLEEP, N H 
The Protoearth, Mars, Venus, and the Moon-forming impactor were 
potentially habitable in the early solar system. The interiors of larger 
asteroids had habitable circulating water . To see when the inner 
solar system became continuously habitable, one needs to consider the 
most dangerous events and the safest refugia from them. Early 
geochemical and accretionary processes set the subsequent silicate 
planet reservoirs and hence hydrospheric and atmospheric masses. 
The moon-forming impact made the Moon and the Earth sterile  
bodies. Following the impact, the Earth passed through a rock-vapor 
atmosphere on the scale of 1000s of years and an internally heated 
steam greenhouse on the scale of 2 m.y. Minerals bearing the principle 
volatiles (water, Cl, and CO2) were stable at the Earth's surface by the 
time it cooled to 800K. The mass of reactable shallow material was 
insufficient to contain the available water and CO2.  
Habitable conditions were established after CO2 could be deeply 
subducted into the mantle.Vast quantities of H2 were vented during 
accretion and after the moon-forming impact and eventually lost to 
space.

          <text>From Wikipedia: 
Homochirality  is a term used to refer to a group of 
molecules that possess the same sense of chirality . 
Molecules involved are not necessarily the same compound, 
but similar groups are arranged in the same way around a 
central atom. In biology homochirality is found inside living 
organisms. Active forms of amino acids are all of the L-form  
and most biologically relevant sugars are of the D-form. 
Typically, the alternative form is inactive and sometimes even 
toxic to living things. The origin of this phenomenon is not 
clearly understood. Homochirality is said to evolve in three 
distinct steps: mirror-symmetry breaking  creates a minute 
enantiomeric imbalance and is key to homochirality, chiral 
amplification  is a process of enantiomeric enrichment and 
chiral transmission  allows the transfer of chirality of one set 
of molecules to another. Homochirality

          <text>What is Life? 
Life can be recognized by its deeds  life is 
disequilibrium, leaving behind the signatures of 
disequilibrium such as fractionated isotopes or complex 
molecules. It is more besides, but the larger question what 
is life? is perhaps beyond natural science. Continuum 
exists between  chemistry, autocatalysis and what every 
one would agree is life. But defining the point at which 
autocatalysis becomes life is like searching for the worlds 
smallest giant.

The vesicular compartment ensures that molecules related by descent are, on average, 
kept in physical proximity to each other, allowing a superior mutant replicase (red) to 
preferentially self-replicate, in comparison to the parental replicase (black). The 
evolutionary advantage of increased replication is amplified as vesicles with superior 
replicase molecules are more likely to give rise to vesicles with at least two replicase 
molecules (or a replicase and a template molecule). Vesicles with less than two 
replicase molecules (indicated by an X) and the progeny of these vesicles cannot 
continue RNA self-replication. In this way, vesicles with superior replicase molecules 
become an increasing fraction of the vesicles that maintain replicase activity.

          <text>Summary 
 Synthesis of organic compounds is pervasive throughout 
the cosmos. 
 
 Simple organic compounds with many of the attributes of 
biological building blocks have been  delivered on dust 
and larger impactors since beginning of the solar system. 
 
 Similar organic compounds are made abiologically under 
conditions existing at different stages of earth history. 
 
 Homochirality is a biochemical quality but likely had its 
origins in cosmochemistry and prebiotic chemistry 
 
 The when and how of the transition from prebiotic 
chemistry to biochemistry remain unsolved.

HOMOCHIRALITY OF BIOMOLECULES 
Kenso Soai* and Itaru Sato 
Abstract 
Asymmetric automultiplication of chiral 
compounds by asymmetric  autocatalysis is realized 
for the first time where a chiral product acts as a 
chiral catalyst for its own production.  
 
In other words, a miniscule chiral excess in a 
compound can propagate when those compounds are 
catalyzing reactions involving themselves.

          <text>An 
extraterrestrial 
origin for 
homochirality? 
http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jbailey/chirality.html In the model 1st proposed by Rubenstein et al. (1983) ( Nature , V ol. 
306:118) the action of circular polarized light on interstellar chiral 
molecules introduced a left handed excess into molecules in the material 
from which the solar system formed . Some of this organic material then 
finds its way onto Earth via impacts of comets, meteorites and dust 
particles during the heavy bombardment phase in the first few hundred 
million years of the solar system. These molecules were then part of the 
prebiotic material available for the origin of life, and tipped the scales for 
life to develop with L-amino acids and D-sugars.  
Rubenstein et al. originally proposed that synchrotron radiation from 
neutron stars in supernova remnants would be a suitable source of the 
required UV circularly polarized light. However, this interpretation is not 
supported by theory or observation which show that the circular 
polarization of these sources is very low.  
New observations with the Anglo-Australian Telescope (above) have 
shown surprisingly high circular polarizations (the red and white regions 
in the image) in the infrared light from reflection nebulae in the star 
forming regions Orion  OMC1 (a region in the Orion nebula M42) and 
NGC 6334. Although we can only observe these regions at infrared 
wavelengths which can penetrate the thick dust clouds in which they are 
embedded, it is predicted that circular polarization should also be present 
at the ultraviolet wavelengths needed for asymmetric photolysis of 
molecules such as amino acids. If our own solar system formed in such a 
region of high circular polarization, it could have led to the excess of L-
amino acids which we see in meteorites and to the homochirality of 
biological molecules.  It is possible that without such a process operating it 
would not be possible for life to start. This may have implications for the 
frequency of occurrence of life in the universe. Figure of polarization in 
Orion OMC1 has been 
removed due to 
copyright restrictions.

          <text>Origin- of-Life: Evolving concepts #1  
&gt;2,000 yrs ago :  The Bible  states God created humans &amp; higher 
organisms. 
&lt; mid 1800s:  Creationism + insects, frogs &amp; other small 
creatures arise spontaneously from mud &amp; rot. 
mid 1800s:  (1)  Pasteur  demonstrated bacteria &amp; other 
microorganisms arise from parents resembling themselves.  
Spontaneous generation is dead.  (2) Darwin  proposes natural 
selection, the theory that environmental pressure results in the 
perpetuation of certain adaptations.  Evolution of complex 
organisms therefore possible, &amp; all current life forms could have 
evolved from a single (last) common ancestor. 
Darwin (privately) suggested life could have arisen from 
chemistry: in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia 
and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc., present.

Time (Billion of years ago)
Atmospheric composition, shown by the relative concentration of various gases, has been greatly influenced by life on the earth. The early atmosphere had fairly high concentrations of water and carbon dioxide and, some experts believe, methane, ammonia, and nitrogen. After the emergence of living organisms, the oxygen that is so vital to  our survival became more plentiful.  Today carbon dioxide, methane and water exists only in trace amounts in the atmosphere.Oxygen

Analyses of selected chiral amino acids from the Murchison meteorite suggest 
L-enantiomer excesses of the order of 5- 10%. In general, the finding of 
enantiomeric excesses in extraterrestrial molecules supports the hypothesis that 
exogenous delivery made a significant contribution to organic chemical evolution 
leading to the origin of life . The finding of these enantiomeric excesses 
specifically in substituted amino acids may have implications for the chemistry of 
a pre-RNA world insofar as it suggests the possibility that these unusual, but 
meteoritically abundant, amino acids were early biomonomers .

"Astrobiology has emerged as a new science for the new 
millennium.  It seeks to understand life in the context of the wider 
cosmos.  The new Centre will continue in the pioneering traditions of 
astrobiology started in Cardiff over 25 years ago, taking note of the 
many relevant discoveries that have been made in recent years.  The 
Centre aims to combine the expertise of astronomers, biochemists 
and microbiologists to generate cutting edge science that would 
eventually enable us to answer the age-old question:  where did we 
come from?"  (Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, director, 
Cardiff Centre for Astrobiology , and author of A Journey With 
Fred Hoyle - The Search for Cosmic Life , World Scientific, 2005). 
 
"We can soon launch panspermia missions to seed other habitable 
solar systems.  We can target nearby stars and star-forming zones in 
interstellar clouds.  Each mission can seed dozens of new solar 
systems where local life has not formed."  (Dr. Michael N. Mautner,

 These experiments suggest that the formation of 
pentoses appears to be the natural outcome of 
the chemical transformation of organic 
molecules present in the nebula that form stars 
and planets in the presence of borate minerals. 
Because neither borate minerals nor interstellar 
organics are excluded from the early Earth, we 
also cannot exclude the availability of ribose  
formed prebiotically at the time when life 
emerged on Earth. Ricardo, A., M. A. Carrigan, A. N. Olcott, and S. A. Benner. " Borate

          <text>Commonality &amp; the Central Problem of 
Origin-of -Life Research 
our last common ancestor stored genetic information in 
nucleic acids that specified the composition of all needed 
proteins.  It also relied on proteins to direct many of the 
reactions required for self-perpetuation.  Hence, the central 
problem of origin-of -life research can be refined to ask, By 
what series of chemical reactions did this interdependent 
system of nucleic acids and proteins come into being ? 
Orgel, Leslie E. "The origin of life on the earth." 
Scientific American 271, no. 4 (1994): 77-83. Insight into the character of the last common ancestor can 
be gained by identifying commonalities  in contemporary 
organisms.  I.e., intricate features common to all modern 
organisms are unlikely to have evolved independently. 
Examples:  similar C compounds, same 20 amino acids make 
all proteins, genetic information in nucleic acids (RNA &amp; DNA).

          <text>How did homochirality arise? 
It may have occurred in the solar nebula during the 
formation of the solar system. 
Amino acids with a slight L-enantiomeric excess is 
observed in the many meteorites incl Murchison 
 (Although beware of contamination, since all Earthly aas 
begin with L configuration.  But note:  during natural 
decomposition processes, protein aas revert to a 50- 50 
(racemic) mixture over time.) 
 Crystal faces have surface structures that are mirror-
images.  Experiments show that crystal faces can select 
L or D amino acids quite efficiently (40% excess) (Hazen, 
2001).  While this mechanism can explain the 
propagation of the L or D configuration, it cannot explain 
the origin  of that  preference.

Stratigraphy: globally-dispersed glacial deposits. 
Carbon isotopes: negative 13C excursions through glacial 
sections (13C reaches ~ -5 to -7). Little or no biological 
productivity (no light). Anomalous banded iron formations w/IRD : only BIFs after 1.7 
Ga. Anoxic seawater covered by ice. 
Cambrian explosion : Rapid diversification of multicellular life

Fig. 2. Neoproterozoic composite carbonate d13C 
chemostratigraphy with U-Pb ID-TIMS ages that 
are directly linked to isotopic profiles (11). Bars 
indicate the time spans of fossil assemblages 
representing eukaryotic crown groups. Asterisks 
indicate fossil groups of uncertain 
taxonomic affinity. Bars faded upward reflect uncertainty in the minimum age constraint; bars 
faded downward reflect uncertainty in the 
maximum age constraint. Dashes represent the time span where a fossil record has not been 
identified but for which the eukaryotic group 's 
presence is inferred from its occurrence in Ediacaran or Phanerozoic strata. Dashes with 
question marks indicate that earlier records have been proposed but the relationships between 
these fossils and the crown groups are uncertain.

          <text>Summary
 	The C-cycle has evolved radically through time 
 	Prior to 2.2 Ga anaerobic prokaryotes dominated; wide spread of oorg (oo)
values; oxygenic photosynthesis extant but oxygen remained low as sinks 
&gt;&gt; sources 
 	Mantle may have been an important sink for oxidising power 
	 Extreme ocarb(oa) values around 2.2 Ga probably signify the GOE and rise
to prominence of aerobes; Decreased spread of oorg ( oa) values may
reflect dominance of aerobic autotrophs and reductive pentose (Benson-
Calvin; C3) cycle 
 	Although ample evidence for aerobes, the abundance of O2 in atm and 
ocean remained low (sulfidic ocean) until another major oxidation eventcaused a second reorganization In the Neoproterozoic.  This was also 
signified by extreme oa fluctuations. 
 	The Neoproterozoic reorganization led to pO
2 rising to near PAL
allowing animals to flourish and stabilizing the new regime 
 	Environmental evolution reflected changes in the balance between thermal, 
crustal, atmospheric &amp; biological processes

          <text>Proles of the 1998 Blue Planet Prize Recipients
Dr. Mikhail I. Budyko ((-. ..  )  
(Born in January 1920 in Gomel in the former Soviet Union (now Belarus) 
Head of the Division for Climate Change Research, State Hydrological Institute, St. Petersburg  
As shown by the unusual weather patterns caused by the El Nino effect, a wide spectrum of 
climate changes on Earth is having a profound effect on human lives and the environment. Since the 1970s, great advances have been made in climatology, the scientic study of the close 
relationship between climate and the environment. Playing a pivotal role in the development of 
climatology has been Dr. Mikhail I. Budyko, one of this year's winners of the Blue Planet Prize. In the 1950s, Dr. Budyko conducted quantitative studies of the global climate by calculating the 
heat balance of the Earth's surface. This balance involves energy from the sun, which is the most 
important determining factor for the Earth's climate. First, Dr. Budyko calculated the energy 
balance of certain regions of the Earth, and then he veried his calculations by making 
comparisons with observational data. Next, using weather data collected from all over the world, Dr. Budyko carried out heat balance calculations for all regions of the world and conrmed that 
they checked out with observational data. He announced his ndings in 1956 with the publication 
of his book Heat Balance of the Earth's Surface.

John Edmond : weathering rates limited by 
abundance of fresh rock, not temperature. 
Increased bioturbation (eukaryote diversity following re-
oxygenation of ocean): Less C accumulation in sediments 
offsets lower weathering rates.

oxygenated Phanerozoic ocean [Fe(II) is soluble; Fe(III) is

(DeNiro and Epstein, 1977; Monson and Hayes, 1980,

Reactions occur between molecules but isotope selectivity is 
expressed as chemical bonds that are made or broken at particular carbon positions. 
Isotope effects pertain to those specific positions and control 
fractionations only at that reaction site, not throughout the whole molecule. 
To calculate changes in the isotopic compositions of whole 
molecules we must first calculate the change at the site and then allow for the rest of the molecule because the isotopic shift is diluted by mixing with carbon that is just along for the ride..Hayes, 2002

Methane-rich water is pumped into the 
mussel and across its gills. The symbiotic bacteria in the gills use methane as both a 
carbon and energy source. The mussels, in 
turn, live off the symbiotic bacteria.  
Using the scanning electron microscope, we can see over a dozen mussel gill cells in the panel on the left. On the right is a closer look at the cell with its outer membrane partially removed. Look into the 
cell to see hundreds of symbiotic bacteria.

At the very edge of the brine pool, the mussels are 
especially abundant and happy. This area is often filled with newly settled baby mussels perched on the shells 
of larger mussels just above the brine.

Gas hydrates (yellow) are ice with gas trapped 
inside; exposed beds are accessible to submersibles on the deep sea floor of the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
Ice worms , a new species only seen in 
hydrate, were discovered in 1997 by C. Fisher, 
Penn State University.

61Tissue Distribution and 13C Values for Seep Mussel Cyclic Triterpenoids
Sterols and hopanols are listed in relative in order of elution from DB-5 columns and were ideatified bt a combination of TLC mobility on conventional
and silver-impregated plates, relative retention times on DB-5 columns, and the mass spectra of trimethylsilyl and acetate derivatives. Trace amounts of 
cholest.8(9)-en-3 ol and a4,4-dimethyl monene were also detected in gill tissue.The 4-methyl-cholesta-7,24-dien-3 -ol may have an internal double bond
at either C-7(8) or C-8(9). The C 31 and C 32 hopanols are products of cleavage of the polyhydroxylated side chains of the various BHP molecules (Fig. 1) (45).
b Total amount of material recovered per gram (dry weight) based on the results of an analysis of isolated tissues obtained from a singal dissected mussel.
  
c 13C values were determined by performing a compound-specific analysis for the acetate derivatives of individual hopanol and sterol compounds that were
large enough to analyze. The reporied  13C values for the free hydroxyl and were calculated after we determined ampirically the isotope effect due to acetate
derivative formation.
b NA, not analyzed.
c NA, compound not detected.

Relationships between the hydrogen isotopic compositions of initial

In general, tree sap isotopically resembles local meteoric water, whereas leaf water is isotopically 
enriched. Organic matter is depleted in D versus the leaf water from which it is 
biosynthesized (values given above are typical for N. American plants). 
In general, lipids are depleted in D versus lignin and cellulose from the same plant, whereas 
cellulose is slightly more depleted than coexisting lignin (Rundle et al., 1989). 
Cellulose is usually analyzed in nitrated form (NO3 replacing OH on each C), so that only the 
nonexchangeable H directly bound to C is analyzed. 
Because the D in cellulose nitrate reflects local water, woods can be used as a proxy for the 
hydrogen isotope composition of past environments in which the wood was made

          <text>5 rules for determining the formal charge of an atom  
1.The elementary state has a redox state of 0  
    H2, O2, S0 
2. The oxidation state is equal to an ions charge  
   Fe3+ = 3, H+ = 1 
 
3. In most compounds O = -2 and H = +1  
 
 4. A neutral molecule has zero net redox state  
   H2O 
 5. A charged species has net redox state equal to its charge  
   OH- = -1

 Detectable when there are &gt;2 isotopes fractionated by different 
mechanisms 
 Seems to apply to gas phase chemistry (eg atmospheric 
processes in Nature) 
 Examples occur in O3, O2, CO2, CO, N2O, H2O2 and sulfate 
aerosols. The isotopic anomalies are apparently linked to 
photochemical reactions 
  A well-known example is the transfer, in the stratosphere, of 
17O and 18O from molecular oxygen to CO2 via ozone. 
 Oxygenated sulfur species undergo gas phase reactions leading 
to MIF in the absence of O2  
 This is the origin of MIF in Archean sulfur species (eg Farquhar 
et al) although the precise mechanisms are still to be elucidated

          <text>Tracing Life in the Earliest Terrestrial Rock Record, Eos Trans. AGU, 82 (47),  
Fall Meet. Suppl., Abstract P22B-0545 , 2001 
Lepland, A.,  van Zuilen, M.,  Arrhenius, G  
The principal method for studying the earliest traces of life in the metamorphosed, oldest ($&gt;$ 3.5 Ga) terrestrial rocks 
involves determination of isotopic composition of carbon, mainly prevailing as graphite. It is generally believed that this 
measure can distinguish biogenic graphite from abiogenic varieties. However, the interpretation of life from carbon isotope 
ratios has to be assessed within the context of specific geologic circumstances requiring (i) reliable protolith interpretation 
(ii) control of secondary, metasomatic processes, and (iii) understanding of different graphite producing mechanisms and 
related carbon isotopic systematics. We have carried out a systematic study of abundance, isotopic composition and 
petrographic associations of graphite in rocks from the ca. 3.8 Ga Isua Supracrustal Belt (ISB) in southern West Greenland. 
Our study indicates that most of the graphite in ISB occurs in carbonate-rich metasomatic rocks (metacarbonates) while 
sedimentary units, including banded iron formations (BIFs) and metacherts, have exceedingly low graphite concentrations. 
Regardless of isotopic composition of graphite in metacarbonate rocks, their secondary origin disqualifies them from 
providing evidence for traces of life stemming from 3.8 Ga. Recognition of the secondary origin of Isua metacarbonates thus 
calls for reevaluation of biologic interpretations by Schidlowski et al. (1979) and Mojzsis et al. (1996) that suggested the 
occurrence of 3.8 Ga biogenic graphite in these rocks. The origin of minute quantities of reduced carbon, released from 
sedimentary BIFs and metacherts at combustion steps $&gt;$ 700 C remains to be clarified. Its isotopic composition (d13C 
from -18 to -25%) may hint at a biogenic origin. However, such isotopically light carbon was also found in Proterozoic mafic 
dykes cross-cutting the metasedimentary units in the ISB. The occurrence of isotopically light, reduced carbon in biologically 
irrelevant dykes may indicate secondary graphite crystallization from CO2 or CH4- containing fluids that in turn may derive 
from bioorganic sources. If this were the case, trace amounts of isotopically light secondary graphite can also be expected 
in metasediments, complicating the usage of light graphite as primary biomarker. The possibility of recent organic 
contamination, particularly important in low graphite samples, needs also to be considered; it appears as a ubiquitous 
component released at combustion in the 400 to 500 deg range. - A potential use of the apatite-graphite association as a 
biomarker has been proposed in the study by Mojzsis et al. (1996). Close inspection of several hundred apatite crystals 
from Isua BIFs and metacherts did, however, not show an association between these two minerals, moreover graphite is 
practically absent in these metasediments. In contrast, apatite crystals in the non-sedimentary metacarbonate rocks were 
found commonly to have invaginations, coatings and inclusions of abundant graphite. Considering that such graphite 
inclusions in apatite are restricted to the secondary metasomatic carbonate rocks in the ISB this association can not be 
considered as a primary biomarker in the Isua Supracrustal Belt References: Mojzsis,S.J, .Arrhenius,G .,

          <text>Sulfur Summary 
The wide spread of d34S values of microscopic pyrites 
aligned along growth faces of former  gypsum crystals 
in the North Pole barite deposit suggests that sulfate-
reducing prokaryotes  had evolved by 3.47 Ga . 
The large S-isotopic fractionations in this localized 
and sulfate-rich environment, but not in other rocks 
imply that Archean ocean was low in sulfate , and, by 
implication, low oxygen in the atmosphere .

KIE occurs when the rate of a chemical reaction 
is sensitive to atomic mass at a particular position 
in one of the reacting species

containing the lighter isotope tend to react

          <text>Formation of the Earth by Accretion 
 Tremendous heat generated in the final accretion process 
resulted in initially molten objects.  
Any molten object of size greater than about 500 km has 
sufficient gravity to cause gravitational separation of light 
and heavy elements thus producing a differentiated  body.  
The accretion process is inefficient, there is lots of left 
over debris.  
In the inner part of the solar system, leftover rocky debris 
cratered the surfaces of the newly formed planets (Heavy 
Bombardment , 4.6-3.8 Ga) .  
In the outer part of the solar system, the same 4 step 
process of accretion occurred but it was accretion of ices 
(cometisemals) instead of grains.

http://www.swri.edu/9what/releases/canupmoon.htm 
Hypothesis for lunar origin - Moon forms from debris ejected as a result of 
the collision of a roughly Mars-sized impactor with early Earth 
 
Geophysical simulations use a method known as smooth particle 
hydrodynamics, or SPH and can achieve resolutions sufficient to study 
the production of orbit-bound debris necessary to yield the Moon 
 
Off-center, low-velocity collisions yield material in bound orbit from 
which a satellite may then accumulate.  
 
Simulations must account for mass, angular momentum and 
compositions of the earth-Moon system.  
 
Must yield an Earth that retains an iron-rich core and a moon that is 
appropriately iron-depleted and the right density. 
SPH results suggest: 
 The object had 10-12% of Earths mass 
 Produces a satellite with &lt;3% Fe by mass. Out of reach &amp; unable to 
 be captured subsequently

http//www.esa.int/rosetta 
The comet explorer carries ten scientific instruments to draw out the secrets of the 
comets chemical and physical composition and reveal its magnetic and electrical 
properties. The lander will take pictures in the macro and micro ranges and send 
all the data thus acquired back to Earth, via Rosetta. 
This will be our first ever chance to be there, at first hand, so to speak, as a comet 
comes to life,  
When Churyumov-Gerasimenko gets to within about 500 million kilometres of the 
Sun, the frozen gases that envelop it will evaporate and a trail of dust will be blown 
back over hundreds of thousands of kilometres. When illuminated by the Sun, this 
characteristic comet tail then becomes visible from Earth. In the course of the 
mission, the processes at work within the cometary nucleus will be studied and 
measured more precisely than has ever before been possible, for earlier probes 
simply flew past their targets.

Earth mostly accreted from rocky 
material in a large, viscous disc of dust 
around a young star (Laplace, 1796 &amp; 
now supported by Hubble 
observations) 
 
Earth accreted from planetesimals in the 
zone 0.8 to 1.3 au around the young 
sun where the temperature gradient 
(1500K to 900K) determined the 
chemical composition of condensing

This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image shows a small portion of one of the largest 
observable star-forming regions in the Galaxy, the Carina Nebula, located 7500 light-years away 
in the southern constellation Carina. It captures the chaotic activity atop a three-light-year-tall 
pillar of gas and dust that is being eaten away by the UV light from nearby massive stars.. The 
image celebrates the 20th anniversary of Hubbles launch and deployment into an orbit around 
Earth. Image courtesy NASA, ESA, and M. Livio and the Hubble 20th Anniversary Team(STScI)

Chrondrites provide much of the evidence for origins of nebula components and 
for planetary formation  - planets that never formed. 
 
Many chondrites have roughly ten times too much D/H (the deuterium excess) 
to have delivered Earths water otherwise have solar elemental abundances 
 
Presence of extinct isotopes eg Al26 now present as Mg26.  Half-life of Al26 is 
low and all would be dissipated in 2 million years.  Therefore Al26 must have 
been trapped in the solar nebula very early after it was formed in a 
supernova.

http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/
Space_Science/Rosetta   
At the end of February 2004, the European Space Agency (ESA) probe 
set off on its journey to meet Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko.  
 
The long-planned get-together will not however take place until the 
middle of 2014. 
 
 A few months after arriving at the comet, Rosetta will release a small 
lander onto its surface. Then, for almost two years it will investigate 
Churyumov-Gerasimenko from close up.

D/H show comets could not have delivered all the Earth's water. 
 
 84Kr/132Xe and the isotopic composition of Xe show that 
chondrites did not deliver the atmospheric noble gases. 
The Martian atmosphere reveals krypton and xenon relative 
abundances and isotope ratios remarkably similar to Earth's,  
An external source seems necessary to satisfy both martian and 
terrestrial data with the D/H result pointing toward comets.  
 
This requires that Earth formed with its own water, to mix with 
the cometary component. The ratios of 15N/14N on Mars and 
Earth (in the atmosphere and rocks) are also consistent with 
cometary delivery of nitrogen in the form of N-compounds.

Parallel evolution of life and the environment. Life processes are 
influenced by chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, 
hydrosphere, cryosphere and the solid earth. In turn, life can influence 
chemical and physical processes on our planet. This course introduces 
the concept of life as a geological agent and examines the interaction 
between biology and the earth system during the roughly 4 billion years 
since life first appeared.

Time (Billion of years ago)
Atmospheric composition, shown by the relative concentration of various gases, has been greatly influenced by life on the earth. The early atmosphere had fairly high concentrations of water and carbon dioxide and, some experts believe, methane, ammonia, and nitrogen. After the emergence of living organisms, the oxygen that is so vital to  our survival became more plentiful.  Today carbon dioxide, methane and water exists only in trace amounts in the atmosphere.Oxygen

Introductions 
Rationale 
The interactive Earth system: bio logy in geologic, 
environmental and climate change throughout Earth history.   
 
Since life began it has continual ly shaped and re-shaped the 
atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the solid earth. 
  
'Geobiology' introduces the conce pt of 'life as a geological 
agent' and examines the interactio n between biology and the 
earth system during the roughly 3.5 billio n years since life 
first appeared.

Life, from wikipedia 
 
Life  is a characteristic that distinguishes objects  that have signaling 
and self-sustaining processes  from those that do not,[1][2]  either 
because such functions have ceased ( death), or else because they lack 
such functions and are classified as inanimate."[3][4]

Has the wavelength dependence of a Blackbody radiator at ~3K. 
Considered to be the remnant of the radia tion emitted at the time the 
expanding universe became transpar ent (to radiation) at ~3000 K.  (Above 
that T matter exists as a plasma (ion ized atoms) &amp; is opaque to most

1) Bible: In 1664, Archbishop Usher of

Genesis to calculate that the world began 
on Oct. 26, 4004 B.C. 
2) Salt in the Ocean: ( ca. 1899) Assuming
the oceans began as fresh water, the rate 
at which rivers are transporting salts to theoceans would lead to present salinity in 
~100 m.y.

Elements above iron in the periodic table cannot be formed in the 
normal nuclear fusion  processes in stars. 
Up to iron, fusion yields ener gy and thus can proceed. 
But since the "iron group"  is at the peak of the binding energy 
curve, fusion of elements above iron  dramatically absorbs energy.

SURFACE ELEVATIONS are distributed quite differently on 
the earth (blue) and on Venus (gold). Most places on the 
earth stand near one of two prevailing levels. In contrast, 
a single height characterizes most of the surface of Venus, 
(Elevation on Venus is given with respect to the planets 
mean radius.)

          <text>Elements Heavier than Iron 
To produce elements heavier than Fe, enormous amounts of 
energy are needed which is thought to derive solely from the 
cataclysmic explosions of supernovae. 
In the supernova explosion, a large flux of energetic neutrons is 
produced and nuclei bombarded by these neutrons build up mass 
one unit at a time (neutr on capture) producing heavy nuclei. 
The layers containing the heavy elements can then be blown off 
be the explosion to provide the raw material of heavy elements in 
distant hydrogen clouds where new stars form.

Course Description : 
Parallel 
evolution of life and the environment. Li fe processes are  influenced by 
chemical and physical proce sses in the atmosphere, hydro sphere, cryosphere and the 
solid earth. In turn, l ife can influence che mical and physical pro cesses on our planet. 
This course introduces the concept of life as a  geological agent and examines the 
interaction between biology and the earth sy stem during the roughly 4 billion years 
since life first appeared.

for the Big 
Bang #1: An 
Expanding 
Universe 
The galaxies we see in all direc tions are moving away from the 
Earth, as evidenced by their red shifts  (Hubble). 
The fact that we see all stars moving away from us does not imply 
that we are the center of  the universe! 
All stars will see all other stars moving away from them in an 
expanding universe. 
A rising loaf of raisin bread is a good visual model: each raisin 
will see all other raisins moving away from it as the loaf expands.

Abundance  
Hydrogen (73%) and He (25%) account for nearly al l the nuclear matter in the universe, 
with all other elements constituting &lt; 2%. 
High % of He argues strongly for the big bang model, since other models gave very low %. 
Since no known process significantly  changes this H/He ratio, it is taken to be the ratio 
which existed at the time when the deuteron bec ame stable in the expansion of the universe. 
19In the hot, early universe,
protons and neutrons were equally numerous since the energy was high enough to exchange them freely back and forth. These temperatures plus theknown abundances provide atest for the expansion ratesin cosmological models.

          <text>Nuclear Binding Energy 
Nuclei are made up of proton s and neutrons, but the mass of a 
nucleus is always less than the sum of  the individual masses of 
the protons and neutro ns which constitute it. 
The difference is a measure of  the nuclear binding energy 
which holds the nucleus together. 
This energy is released during fusion. 
BE can be calculated from the relationship:  BE = mc2 
For a particle, m= 0.0304 u, yielding BE=28.3 MeV 
**The mass of nuclei heavier than Fe is greater  than the mass 
of the nuclei merged to form it.**

          <text>Cosmic Abundance 
of the Elements 
H (73%) &amp; He (25%) account for 
98% of all nuclear matter in the universe. 
Low abundances of Li, Be, B due 
to high combustibility in stars. High abundance of nuclei w/ mass divisible by 
4He: 
C,O,Ne,Mg ,Si,S,Ar,Ca 
High Fe abundance due to max 
binding energy. Even  heavy nuclides favored  over 
odd due to lower neutron-capture 
cross-section (smaller target = higher abundance). All nuclei with &gt;209 particles (
209Bi) are radioactive.

Results in highly differentiated magma distinct from basalt--the low-

Earth may be the only planet where this type of crust exists.

Major Episodes of Growth
Geologic Age (Billions of Years Before Present)
Crustal Growth has proceeded in episodic fashion for billions of years. An important growth spurt lasted 
from about 3.0 to 2.5 billion years ago, the transition between the Archean and Proterozoic eons. 
Widespread melting at this time formed the granite bodies that now constitute much of the upper layer of
the continental crust.

 James Hutton 
http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/James_Hutton 
His theories of geology and geologic time , also called 
deep time  came to be included in theories which 
were called plutonism  and uniformitarianism . 
He is also credited as the first scientist to publicly 
express the Earth was alive  and should be 
considered a superorganism . 
Hutton reasoned that there must have been innumerable cycle s, each involving 
deposition on the seabed, uplift with tilting and erosion then undersea again for further 
layers to be deposited. On the belief that this was due to the same geolo gical forces 
operating in the pa st as the very slow geological forces seen opera ting at the present 
day, the thicknesses of ex posed rock layers implied to h im enormous stretches of time

          <text>Comparative Responses of Model C3 and C4 Plants 
to Drought in Low and Elevated CO 2
JOY K. WARD, DAVID T. TISSUE, RICHARD B. THOMAS and BOYD R. STRAIN
Abstract
Interactive effects of CO 2 and water availability have been predicted to alter the competitive relationships between C3 and 
C4 species over geological and contemporary time scales. We tested the effects of drought and CO 2 partial pressures 
(pCO 2) ranging from values of the Pleistocene to those predicted for the future on the physiology and growth of model C3 
and C4 species. We grew co-occurring Abutilon theophrasti (C3) and Amaranthus retroflexus  (C4) in monoculture at 18 
(Pleistocene), 27 (preindustrial), 35 (current), and 70 (future) Pa CO 2 under conditions of high light and nutrient availabi-
lity. After 27 days of growth, water was withheld from randomly chosen plants of each species until visible wilting occurred. 
Under well-watered conditions, low pCO2 that occurred during the Pleistocene was highly limiting to C3 photosynthesis and 
growth, and C3 plants showed increased photosynthesis and growth with increasing pCO 2 between the Pleistocene and fut-
ure CO 2 values. Well-watered C4 plants exhibited increased photosynthesis in response to increasing pCO2, but total mass
and leaf area were unaffected by pCO2. In response to drought, C3 plants dropped a large amount of leaf area and mainta-
ined relatively high leaf water potential in remaining leaves, whereas C4 plants retained greater leaf area, but at a lower leaf water potential. Furthermore, drought-treated C3 plants grown at 18 Pa CO
2 retained relatively greater leaf area than 
C3 plants grown at higher pCO2 and exhibited a delay in the reduction of stomatal conductance that may have occurred in 
response to severe carbon limitations.

          <text>Fig. 2. The occurrence of the C25 HBI skeleton in marine 
 
sediments ( A) and petroleum ( B) through geological time 
 
based on the analysis of over 400 sediment and 81 petroleum 
 
samples. For marine sediments, the relative abundance of the 
 
C25 HBI alkane is indicated by the ratio of the HBI alkane to 
phytane (Ph) (HBI/Ph+1) plotted on a log scale. Phytane is 
derived from the side chain of chlorophyll, which can be 
derived from all photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria. For 
petroleum, the C25 HBI alkane concentration is presented on a
 
log scale in g g1 (parts per million) of the total saturated 
 
alkanes of each petroleum. The detection limit is 100 ppm, 
 
and all samples plotted on the 100 ppm line, thus, do not 
contain detectable amounts of C25 HBI alkane. Uncertainties 
in the ages of the petroleum samples are indicated by error 
bars. Both plots clearly show that the HBI biosynthetic 
pathway did not exist before ca. 90 Ma. (Inset) shows the 
more exact timing of this event.

Traditionally the red algae were divided into two Classes the Bangiophyceae 
and Florideophyceae. Alternatively a single Class, the Rhodophyceae and two 
Subclasses, Bangiophycidae and Florideophycidae are used. Based on 
ultrastructure and molecular evidence the Bangiophyceae is now accepted as a 
paraphyletic group, while the Florideophyceae is considered to be monophyletic

 	 The Woody Magnoliid Hypothesis -- Cladistic analyses by Doyle and Donoghue favor
an early angiosperm with morphology similar to living members of the Magnoliales and
Laurales. 
 	 These groups are small to medium-sized trees with long broad leaves and large flowers
with indeterminate numbers perianth parts. The carpels are imperfectly fused, and make
a physical intermediate between a folded leaf and fused pistil. This hypothesis is also
favored by molecular studies, and so currently is favored by systematic botanists. 
 	 It suggests that the earliest angiosperms were understory trees and shrubs, and
that the flower was NOT the key innovation for the rapid diversification of
angiosperms. In fact woody magnoliids are not particularly diverse, even today. 
 	 The Paleoherb Hypothesis -- The alternative view is an herbaceous origin for the
angiosperms. This view has been championed in recent years by Taylor and Hickey,
paleobotanists whose cladistic analysis of angiosperms suggests a very different scenario
from that previously described. In their analysis, the basal angiosperms are tropical
paleoherbs, a group of flowering plants with uncomplicated flowers and a mix ofmonocot and dicot features. 
 	 The implication here is that the key innovations of flowers and a rapid life cycle
were present in the earliest angiosperms. It has been suggested that changes in
climate or geography provided opportunities for these early angiosperms to
diversify.

FERNS date back to at least the Middle Devonian. They include four living groups: 
Marattiales, Ophioglossales , Psilotales and leptosporangiate ferns. 
Some early groups that are now extinct, including the Stauropteridales and 
Zygopteridales. The chart below shows the stratigraphic ranges over which each 
group is known to have existed. The green taxa on the right side of the chart are 
groups of ferns; the blue taxa to the left are Sphenophytes or Sphenopsids ; and the 
purple Cladoxylopsida in the center are a closely related group. 
Of all living ferns, only the Psilotales has no fossil record

With their glassy skeletons of often perfect geometric form and symmetry, radiolarians are among 
the most beautiful of all protists. They are also an ancient group, going back all the way to the early Cambrian  Period. Their abundance in many rocks, their long geologic history, and their diversity 
through time make them important sources of information on the geologic age and structure of many deposits. 
Radiolaria can range anywhere from 30 microns to 2 mm in diameter. Their skeletons tend to have 
arm-like extensions that resemble spikes, which are used both to increase surface area for buoyancy 
and to capture prey. Most radiolarians are planktonic, and get around by coasting along ocean 
currents. Most are somewhat spherical, but there exist a wide variety of shapes, including cone-like 
and tetrahedral forms (see the image above). Besides their diversity of form, radiolarians also exhibit a wide variety of behaviors. They can reproduce sexually or asexually; they may be filter feders or predators; and may even participate in symbiotic relations with unicellular algae.

Foraminifera (forams for short) are single-celled protists with shells. Their shells are also 
referred to as tests because in some forms the protoplasm covers the exterior of the shell. 
The shells are commonly divided into chambers which are added during growth, though the 
simplest forms are open tubes or hollow spheres. Depending on the species, the shell may be 
made of organic compounds, sand grains and other particles cemented together, or crystalline calcite. Fully grown individuals range in size from about 100 micrometers to almost 20 centimeters long. A single individual may have one or many nuclei within its cell. The largest living species 
have a symbiotic relationship with algae , which they "farm" inside their shells. Other species 
eat foods ranging from dissolved organic molecules, bacteria , diatoms and other single celled 
phytoplankton, to small animals such as copepods. They move and catch their food with a 
network of thin extensions of the cytoplasm called reticulopodia, similar to the pseudopodia 
of an amoeba, although much more numerous and thinner.

		Each of the major groups of foraminifera uses different materials to
build their shells. The basic types of wall structures are: 
		agglutinated -- test made of particles cemented together. Some
species use whatever particles are available, while other species
may select only sponge spicules or mica flakes or a certain size
particle to build their test. 
		calcareous hyaline -- interlocking crystals of calcite about 1
micrometer in diameter. 
		microgranular -- equidimensional, subspherical particles of calciteclosely packed together without cement. 
		porcellaneous -- wall made of apparently randomly arrangedmicroscopic rods of calcite, with ordered inner and outer surface
layers.

          <text>Though their silica skeletons have allowed us to find numerous fossils, scientists still have not 
been able to successfully develop a complete classification scheme for them. The evolution of the Radiolaria can be easily traced on the broad scale, with major transitions in the global 
fauna, but a concise taxomony reflecting the evolutionary relationships of major groups is still 
elusive. Until comparatively recently, radiolarians were primarily studied by micropaleontologists , and only at the end of the 20th century have scientists from other 
fields begun to study these fascinating protists as well. 
Radiolaria exhibit several different types of behavior that should be noted. They often share relationships with dinoflagellate symbionts. These dinoflagellate symbionts are 
enclosed in a thin envelope of cytoplasm produced by the host's rhizopodial system. 
Radiolaria provide ammonium and carbon dioxide for the dinoflagellate symbionts, and in 
return the dinoflagellates provide their radiolarian host with a jelly-like layer that serves as both for protection and capturing prey. Another symbiotic relationship for in radiolarians is with algal symbionts. When food is scarce, an algal symbiont can provide its host 
radiolarian with much needed nourishment. There is very little known about the 
Radiolaria-algal symbiont symbiotic relationship, but it is known that algal symbionts are 
found in the extracapsulum of many radiolarians, and can provide a host with enough 
nourishment to allow it to maintain nutritional autonomy . This simply means that the 
radiolarian can go several weeks with out food. Algal symbionts can also alleviate competition among individuals of a Radiolaria colony. Algal symbionts are generally found 
only within Radiolaria who dwell in areas that receive sufficient light

Molecular Evidence for the Early Colonization of Land by Fungi 
and Plants 
Daniel S. Heckman, David M. Geiser, Brooke R. Eidell, Rebecca L. Stauffer, 
Natalie L. Kardos, S. Blair Hedges 
The colonization of land by eukaryotes probably was facilitated by a 
partnership (symbiosis) between a photosynthesizing organism 
(phototroph) and a fungus. However, the time when colonization occurred remains speculative. The first fossil land plants and fungi appeared 480 to 460 million years ago (Ma), whereas molecular clock estimates suggest an earlier colonization of land, about 600 Ma. Our protein sequence analyses indicate that green algae and major lineages of fungi were present 1000 Ma and that land plants appeared by 700 Ma, possibly affecting Earth's atmosphere, climate, and evolution of animals in the Precambrian.

 http://www.soes.soton.ac.uk/staff/tt/eh/coccoliths.html 
This page describes Ehux coccoliths, i.e. the characteristic calcareous plates the cell 
produces. People often loosely refer to Ehux as a coccolith, which is strictly speaking 
incorrect. This is not drastically important but the correct terminology is: 
Coccolithophore - the organism, including the cell and external coccoliths. 
Coccosphere - the more or less spherical layer of coccoliths surrounding the cell. 
Coccolith - the individual calcareous plates. 
Ehux produces coccoliths that are approx. 2.5 x 10^-6 metres in diameter, and which weigh 
approx. 1.8 x 10^-12 g each. Of this weight, the average contents of carbon, oxygen and 
calcium atoms in the coccolith CaCO3 have been measured to be 0.28, 0.87 and 0.67 x 10^-12 g per coccolith respectively (Fagerbakke et al, 1994). 
For comparison, the wavelength of visible light is in the range 0.4-0.7 x 10^-6 metres, and a 
pinhead is about 2000 x 10^-6 metres in diameter.

          <text>ANGIOSPERMS 
 
		The rapid diversification of
angiosperm taxa began in the
Albian (mid-Cretaceous) 
		At that time, there was an almost
exponential increase in angiosperm
diversity, and there does not appear
to have been any major extinctions
of groups in between. 
		Despite the large numbers of taxa
that are known from rather early in
this diversification, there is no
indication of where the taxa are coming from. 
		D.I. Axelrod has suggested that we
do not find early angiosperm fossils
because the earliest angiospermslived in dry, upland habitats where
the were unlikely to be preserved as
fossils. This idea remains to be tested. Image courtesy of Museum of Paleontology, University of California. Used with permission. 
Nearly all of our food comes from flowering plants; 
grains, beans, nuts, fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices almost all come from plants with flowers, as 
do tea, coffee, chocolate, wine, beer, tequila, and 
cola. Much of our clothing comes from them as well -- cotton and linen are made from "fibers" of flowering plants, as are rope and burlap, and many commercial dyes are extracted from other 
flowering plants. We also owe them credit for a 
large number of our drugs, including over-thecounter medicines such as aspirin, prescribed drugs such as digitalis and atropine, and controlled drugs such as opium, cocaine, marijuana, and 
tobacco.

          <text>Diatoms 
 
Oldest fossils are Jurassic. Some lower Cretaceous and an excellent record 
from the Late Cretaceous 
Diatoms have found a resource (SiO2) that few other groups exploit and 
have taken advantage. 6% as costly as cellulose to make SiO2 frustule 
Their lifecycles often involve sedimentation when nutrients decline and later 
 
-resuspension. Rhizosolenia (?) Sinks to low O2 water to collect NO3 
Significant N-fixation by hertocystous N-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts of 
Rhizosolenia 
CaCO3 will dissolve at depth whereas silica is more resistant. Huge areas of 
the sea floor are covered in diatomaceous material. 
Amorphous silica has interesting optical properties, unlike CaCo3 which is 
largely opaque. Why does a photosynthetic organism like a coccolithophorid choose to bury itself in opaque material? Some believe silica frustules can refract light to make it more available for diatoms. 
Opal changes volume when heated so diatomaceous sediments can make 
good oil reservoirs

          <text>Diatoms 
 
BACILLARIOPHYTA 
Diatoms are unicells that share the feature of having a cell wall made of silicon 
dioxide. This opaline or glass frustule is composed of two parts ( valves ), which fit 
together with the help of a cingulum or set of girdle bands. 
The taxonomy of diatoms is based in large part on the shape and structure of the 
siliceous valves. Although some species can be identified in the living state, and 
some genera were and have been erected based on the organization and fate of 
cytoplasmic organelles, species-level identifi cation usually requires examination with 
oil immersion objectives of permanently-mounted specimens. 
Two major groups of diatoms are generally recognized: the centric diatoms 
exhibit radial symmetry (symmetry about a point) and have oogamous sexual 
reproduction. 
The pennate diatoms are bilaterally symmetrical (symmetry about a line) and 
produce ameboid gametes that are morphologically similar but may be 
physiologically different. 
Chloroplasts of diatoms are variable, but consistent within most taxa. Chloroplasts 
may be many small discs, a condition found in most centric diatoms and some 
(araphid) pennates, or few large, plate-like chloroplasts are found in the majority of 
pennate taxa.

          <text>Fig. 1. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on nearly complete 18S 
 
rRNA sequences of diatoms. Some of the sequences were published before 
 
(5); 86 others (see table S1 for details) were determined in this study. The 
 
sequences of Coccoid haptophyte and Emiliania huxleyi were used as 
 
outgroups but were pruned from the tree. Bolidomonas mediterranea is a 
 
sister group of the diatoms. The tree was created with the use of the Jukes 
 
Cantor model. HBI-biosynthesizing strains are indicated in red. Diatoms in 
 
green were tested but did not contain HBI alkenes; diatoms in black were 
 
not tested for the presence of HBI alkenes. The scale bar indicates 10% 
 
sequence variation. The inset shows the structure of C25 HBI alkane (27) 
 
and parent skeleton of C25 HBI unsaturated alkenes (711) produced by 
 
diatoms. Note that the odd non HBI-biosynthesizing Rhizosolenia  strain, R. 
robusta , falls completely out of the Rhizosolenia phylogenetic cluster, 
indicating that its morphological classification as a Rhizosolenia diatom is 
probably wrong

          <text>Fig. 1. A consensus phylogeny of eukaryotes. The vast majority of characterized 
eukaryotes, with the notable exception of major subgroups of amoebae, can now 
be assigned to one of eight major groups. Opisthokonts (basal flagellum) have a 
single basal flagellum on reproductive cells and flat mitochondrial cristae (most 
eukaryotes have tubular ones). Eukaryotic photosynthesis originated in Plants; 
theirs are the only plastids with just two outer membranes. Heterokonts (different flagellae) have a unique flagellum decorated with hollow tripartite hairs 
(stramenopiles) and, usually, a second plain one. Cercozoans are amoebae with 
filose pseudopodia, often living with in tests (hard outer shells), some very 
elaborate (foraminiferans). Amoebozoa are mostly naked amoebae (lacking 
tests), often with lobose pseudopodia for at least part of their life cycle. Alveolates have systems of cortical alveoli directly beneath their plasma 
membranes. Discicristates have discoid mitochondrial cristae and, in some 
cases, a deep (excavated) ventral feeding groove. Amitochondrial excavates lack 
substantial molecular phylogenetic support, but most have an excavated ventral 
feeding groove, and all lack mitochondria. The tree shown is based on a consensus of molecular (14) and ultrastructural (16, 17 ) data and includes a 
rough indication of new ciPCR "taxa" (broken black lines) ( 711 ). An asterisk 
preceding the taxon name indicates probable paraphyletic group

38Antarctic Sea Ice-a Habitat for Extremophiles
The pack ice of Earths polar oceans appears to be frozen white desert, devoid of life.
However, beneath the snow lies a unique habitat for a group of bacteria and microscopic plants and animals that are encased in an ice matrix at low temperatures and light levels, with the only liquid being pockets of concentrated brines. Survival in these conditions requiresa complex suite of physiological and metabolic adaptations, but sea-ice organisms thrive in theice, and their prolific growth ensures they play a fundamental role in polar ecosystems. Apartfrom their ecological importance, the bacterial and algae species found in sea ice have become the focus for novel biotechnology, as well as being considered proxies for possible life forms onicecovered extraterrestrial bodies.D.N.

37Antarctic Sea Ice-a Habitat for Extremophiles
The pack ice of Earths polar oceans appears to be frozen white desert, devoid of life.
However, beneath the snow lies a unique habitat for a group of bacteria and microscopic plants and animals that are encased in an ice matrix at low temperatures and light levels, with the only liquid being pockets of concentrated brines. Survival in these conditions requiresa complex suite of physiological and metabolic adaptations, but sea-ice organisms thrive in theice, and their prolific growth ensures they play a fundamental role in polar ecosystems. Apartfrom their ecological importance, the bacterial and algae species found in sea ice have become the focus for novel biotechnology, as well as being considered proxies for possible life forms onicecovered extraterrestrial bodies.D.N.

          <text>ABSTRACTQuantitative Habitability
EVERETT L. SHOCK1,2 and MELANIE E. HOLLAND1,*
A framework is proposed for a quantitative approach to studying habitability. Considerations of 
environmental supply and organismal demand of energy lead to the conclusions that power units are most appropriate and that the units for habitability become watts per organism. Extreme and plush environments are revealed to be on a habitability continuum, and extreme environments can be quantified as those where power supply only barely exceeds demand. Strategies for laboratory and field experiments are outlined that would quantify power supplies, power demands, and habitability. An example involving a comparison of various metabolisms pursued by halophiles is shown to be well on the way to a quantitative habitability analysis.

 Antarctic Sea Ice-a Habitat for Extremophiles
The pack ice of Earths polar oceans appears to be frozen white desert, devoid of life.
However, beneath the snow lies a unique habitat for a group of bacteria and microscopic plants and animals that are encased in an ice matrix at low temperatures and light levels, with the only liquid being pockets of concentrated brines. Survival in these conditions requiresa complex suite of physiological and metabolic adaptations, but sea-ice organisms thrive in theice, and their prolific growth ensures they play a fundamental role in polar ecosystems. Apartfrom their ecological importance, the bacterial and algae species found in sea ice have become the focus for novel biotechnology, as well as being considered proxies for possible life forms onicecovered extraterrestrial bodies.D.N.

Very little attention given to  extreme habitats prior to mid 20th C 
1977, deep-sea hydrothermal vents first discovered 
1977, the Archaea are discovered  (Woese and Fox) 
1980 -1990, the Archaea are slowly recognized as a legitimate group;

          <text>Calcification Mechanisms  
 The organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of lime, one by one, 
from the foaming breakers, and unite them into a symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge fragments; yet what will that tell against the accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day, month after month. Thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of polypus, through the agency of the vital laws, conquering the great mechanical power of the waves of an ocean, which neither the art of man nor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist.
