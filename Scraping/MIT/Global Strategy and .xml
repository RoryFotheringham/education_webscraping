          <text>A Global World
 
1) Interdependence is the keyword of globalization . It means that the performance of each nation is impacted by the 
performance of the other nati
ons, and this is true for all nations including the bigger ones. Therefore, the 
performance of each nation 
(say, its economic growth) in a global world is not autonomous (it cant be 
determined by the wi
ll of its People alone) but rather depends on how other nations are performing too. It is of 
course possible to 
measure each nations performance at any point in time, but such metrics are only meaningful 
if taken as part 
of a non-linear dynamic system that models the whole world. A country may do very well, and in 
so doing bring 
about such large growth in the production of carbon, locally and worldwide, that it may ultimately 
contribute to the destructi
on of the planet. 
2) We only have one planet . This is why globalization (as interdependence) is not a matter of choice, but rather an 
historic imperati
ve. It was always so, and globalization as a process has been out there since the dawn of human 
societies, though now i
t is more obvious as our technology can really impact our physical environment). 
3) However inevitable 
or positive globalization may be (and not all will agree on that), we know the process itself is 
not smooth and is 
rather difficult for many (namely for those that see their jobs and livelihoods seriously 
disturbed by new patterns 
of international specialization). History and the shadow of the past may also have a 
negative impact, as 
some nations may feel that this is their turn to be centre stage. Globalization may well recede 
at some point, as 
it did in the past. The question is if one can pursue it and have contingent plans at the same 
time. 
4) In a globally integrated company, the only meaningful performance is that of the whole . That is what a one 
company policy actual
ly entails. We can (and must) somehow measure the economic and financial performance 
of each national uni
t, but such measurement is largely conventional. National institutions such as local tax 
regulations and i
nternational trade agreements make such accounting a legal requirement. But such fiscal 
accounting at the country 
level is a technical matter for the multinational companys CFO, not for the general 
managers of local or 
global units. 
5) It is quite 
a spectacle to watch managers of the same multinational company (that is, colleagues) behave like 
enemies when it 
comes to transfer pricing across countries. Something that is an abstract construction for the 
most part (no market equi
valents, for example) becomes the source of mistrust and loss of energy in what was 
supposed to be a uni
ted organization around the world. This is not to say that local performance does not 
matter. It surely matters 
a great deal locally to local employees, media, governments, and so on. But it has to 
be taken as local
, not more than that  but, even so, interdependent with the rest.

          <text>Global ? 
1)	 The expressions global and globalization are relatively recent but quickly became a central feature of our 
contemporary world. But what does global mean? What does a CEO mean with our company is global? Or when stating our company has started a process of globalization? 
2)	 I have observed at least three very different uses of global, each corresponding to a different meaning of 
globalization. They are all out there, and we cant really say that they are wrong. But we do need to be careful, 
as the ensuing confusion is quite dysfunctional. 
3)	 Some use global to mean everywhere in the world, or at least in many parts or the world. A company would be 
global if it were present in many countries, perhaps in all continents. Globalization would then mean the same as internationalization. Sure, global sounds more contemporary. But if this is the meaning we wish to express, 
why not say very international or simply worldwide? Those terms mean exactly that, without being confusing. 
4)	 Others use global to mean the same everywhere in the world. In this sense, globalizing would be tantamount to 
standardizing at the world level. This is the meaning inspired by cases such as McDonald's, Coke, or Visa. It comes 
from the concept of a global market, which by definition is a market of one (same) product everywhere (as opposed to a set of national markets, each one with a local variation of the product and different terms of trade). 
Indeed, McDonald's became the symbol of globalization, and its restaurants have at times served as the instigator of 
those who are anti-globalization. 
5)	 (When I look around the world, both 
inside and outside companies, this use of "globalization" has the most negative 
connotation: We 
dont want to become like them is often uttered, namely by young people  and the them 
tends to be the American. I gather that it was the British in the 19th Century or the Romans over twenty 
centuries ago. 
I wonder if it 
will be the Chinese or the Indian in a not-too-distant future.) 
6)	 In line with this 
global market meaning, the adjective global came to mean the strategy of a company that is 
not responsive to national differences, and therefore aggregates its offering to benefit from economies of scale. Act global (do the same everywhere) came 
to mean the opposite of act local (do different things in each 
locale).

          <text>Global ? (cont.) 
6) There is nothing wrong in principle with having the same thing (product, process, rule, and so on) 
everywhere in the world. M
any companies do, and to their benefit. But then, if we wish to say that 
something is the same everywhere, 
why not just say that such thing is universal? I f you wish for 
all of a company's subsidiaries around the world to purchase a r aw material using the same specifications, 
rules and process, then just state that the procurement o f such raw material is universal. 
7) Indeed, a company cannot exist (let alone perform) as a multinational company unless some of its 
elements, such as strategy and organization, are universal. Such elements (which I refer to as the
universal core) constitute the essence of the company and the source of its differentiated 
worldwide performance and value. Elements of such a universal core may include a value proposition, 
a set of principles and values, a decision-making process, a governance regime, and so on. However, the 
general rule is that only a part of what makes up a successful company is universal. Even in the high 
performing MNC, there is a lot of room for feeling and acting locally. 
8) The expression global is used in yet another meaning  its most meaningful nowadays. It means the 
totality of something, its entirety or wholeness. In this sense, a global company is a multinational 
company that is one, in that its organization is united across borders (as opposed to a set or portfolio of 
local organizational units). This is the meaning of global that is in line with the contemporary process that 
economists and political scientists call globalization. Globalization is, of course, not the process by which 
the world becomes the same, but the process by which it becomes integrated. 
9) A global world is a union of different nations. Indeed, the more global the world, the more the local 
differences matter for company performance. More generally, the more global the world (that is, the 
more extended and deeper the process of globalization around the world), the more that nations will be 
different. The value of global integration arises from the different specialization of each national part, not 
from each part copying the rest.

10) Adam Smith remarkably intuited that the larger the extent of the market, the deeper the division of 
labour. Hence, the more global markets that exist, the more locations will specialize  and make national 
differences more relevant. The more global the world, the more the differences matter for the performance of 
companies  not the opposite. 
11) Note that the three uses of the expression global are somehow related. In a global (united) world, 
the process of internationalization is different and the value of a global (worldwide) reach is higher than in a divided world. Such new internationalization process and higher global value largely depend on how 
global (universal) the company is, or may be, across countries. 
12) The received polysemy of gl
obalization is, as it were, here to stay. One could even imagine a CEO 
uttering: Our vision is to have a global, global, global 
company  translation: a worldwide, universal, and 
globally integrated company. Aristotle warned us: a man is more likely to know what it is he asserts, if it has 
been made clear to him how many meanings it may have. So must we, whenever we discuss globalization 
and global.

Globalization is a process of increased 
interdependence across nations. 
A global world is a united world in the sense that the 
most meaningful performance is the performance of the whole. 
A global world is a union of differences.

The /g2cost of distance/g3 is so low that it  
Eliminates the profitability of arbitraging things that are easy to move 
Increases the intensity of global competition and transnational production 
Traditional sources of superior performance (such as scale or low labor cost) 
become requirements  for normal  performance (that is, for competitive parity,  
not competitive advantage)  
 
Competitive advantage is primarily based on knowledge  (skills, 
technologies, user experience, ) and other * 
intangibles  
(reputation, culture, institutions) that are very hard to move or 
copy.   
Knowledge (of the hard to move kind) is increasingly dispersed

          <text>Different Nations, different technical perfromance  
 and different skills 
1) Different nations constitute different technological environments (the T. in the local pitch). This implies 
a differentiated access 
to technical efficiency and innovation by companies in different countries. 
2) Anecdotal evidence is 
all around us  as in the news about SAP and its finding of local specialist skills. 
Financial markets knowl
edge is concentrated in places such as New York and London; wine technology in 
France; design skil
ls in Italy; TV production skills in Hollywood or Rio de Janeiro; scientific knowledge in 
the US or Russia; 
and so on. 
3) The evidence provided 
by Hall and Soskice is telling. National patent specialisation is a proxy for technical 
proficiency and i
nnovation in different industries. What the evidence shows is that a statement about the 
general superior innovati
on capability of the US is false: there are many industries in which Germany is 
more innovative than 
the US. In some industries (such as semiconductors, information technologies, 
medical engineering, 
biotechnology), US companies are relatively more technically savvy and innovative 
than their German counterparts. 
But in industries such as agricultural machines, mechanical elements, or 
engines, German companies 
lead technically. The same is surely valid for other countries  if only we had 
comparable evidence. 
4) Note that, broadly put, 
the industries where Germany exhibits high patent specialization have heavy 
products (metals, for most 
part), call for skills that take long to master, have long product development 
cycles, require l
arge factories, and tend to have incumbents as innovators. Those were the US leads are 
light products (even 
immaterial), are science-based, have fast development cycles, can be made in a lab, 
require relativel
y small sums to start up and promise fast returns. 
5) Why such differences i
n technical aptitude? National history and culture, on one side, and the natural and 
institutional contexts 
on the other, are very relevant here. A serendipitous invention by a local individual 
or company may turn i
nto a big thing and start a stream of technical specialization and innovation. If we 
look into the 
history of science and technology, the history of different industries in different countries, 
the respective education 
systems, company ownership structures, financial markets, government 
intervention, and so 
on, we can start to explain and perhaps even predict the differences of technological 
performance across nations.

          <text>Nations matter!
 
1) Nations are different . This is evident the moment you get to know two nations*  and you may not even need to 
leave your country: just ask the Belgium, the Spanish, the Swiss, or the Indian. Or recall that the British even 
have four different national teams in soccer. There is nothing new in national diversity. It has always been so, and 
it will always be so. Sure, many may believe that nations are all alike or will one day be so. We are all humans, 
arent we?, is a common argument. Wrong argument. It is exactly because we are all human that nations are 
different. Because, as humans, our environment, the context we live in, matters a lot  and environmental 
differences carve our national differences over time. 
2) Human beings are local beings . We are fully dependent on the immediate surroundings for life. Without a number 
of vital material and energetic exchanges with our surroundings, we simply die. We cant feel at a distance, as most of our senses are very limited in physical scope. Our technical achievements mitigate some of these boundaries, but that does not change our nature. Emotions decay quickly. When we see a huge disaster in 
some distant country on TV, it will not normally affect us as intensely as an accident o n our street. 
3) As human beings, we have a physical nature as well as a social nature . Both are natural to us. We are shaped by 
both nature and nurture. Where we are born and raised matters a great deal. People born and raised near the sea are different from people inland. Perhaps it is the salt in the air or the smell of the sea that we love to 
inhale, or that since a very young age we see such an uneven, physical world around us, or that our child 
wonders about the other side of the sea, or even being accustomed to sailors from distant lands. And, an island people is different from a continental people. 
4)	 Smaller nations or peoples, such as the Slovenes or the Catalans, are different from larger nations, such as the 
Americans or the Brazilians. It is both the size of the national community and the extension of their homelands. The 
exposure to a different people is much more likely when you belong to a small nation. Many Americans will never 
leave the US, and never truly be exposed to a different nation; one can live and work in very different places in such 
large country, one can do almost all kinds of tourism, and one can retire to a welcoming climate  and the rivalry 
among cities and regional differences are enough to fuel several great sports. There are of course local 
differences within a large country such as the US, but a unique language and common, country-wide institutions 
matter a lot. 
* It is not always clear what one means by nation  which I will take as a People and their territory. 
However, when we use the expressions international/multinational we tend to mean across/multiple countries. 
Nation and country are most often used interchangeably. To confuse matters, countries may comprise one or more 
nations or Peoples, and be formally organised as one or more states. And this matters too

          <text>Different Nations, different customers and users  
1) The differences across nations are also visible in the qualities of local demand. Local tastes and preferences are 
shaped by local geography, 
culture, and history. The expectations and behaviour of local customers and 
consumers are guided by 
local regulations and other institutions, such as education, health organizations, or 
consumer activists. User 
proficiency is affected by the overall stage of local technology. The perceived and 
actual value of a product, good, or service in different countries is different. 
2) Suffice to drive 
a car in different places around the world  and one has little doubt about how local traits shaped 
car drivers, pedestrians, 
police officers, and so on  let alone cars. Japanese cars were not smaller because of 
some grand vision 
of fuel efficiency, but rather because space is one of the scarcest resources in Japan. Try to 
buy a dedicated parki
ng space or have a private garage for your car there, and youll quickly find out why it 
makes sense to have a 
small car and a good anti-corrosion finish. 
3) The local pitch 
effects customers, clients, prescribers, consumers and users in other relevant ways. Two are 
worth noting: exigency  and lead-use . 
4) Not all customers are 
equally demanding. That is true in any country, and especially true across countries. It is 
not just cultural bel
iefs (such as universalism or particularism) and values (such as fairness) that shape such 
differentiated national 
exigency, it is also institutional practices and their effectiveness (such as local warranty 
regulations or consumer 
rights activism). Such cultural and institutional differences create different expectations 
about the quality 
of goods and the level of services. 
5) One of my observati
ons, anecdotal as it may be, is that a detrimental difference between the North and the 
South of the world 
is the level of customer exigency, more so than technology gaps. Companies in the South 
are often poorer in 
quality and higher in relative price simply because their local customers do not demand too 
much of them or have 
learned over time that claiming for better value is simply ineffective. A particularistic bias 
and a relationshi
p-oriented culture (two common traits in many Southern cultures) do create more passive 
customers. The product is in bad shape, but it was the higher temperature during transport; you know, it was 
not their fault. 
We've known them (the supplier) for long and they are very nice people. Lets use the product anyway. 
Our customers wont compl
ain either and if they do we will explain that the alternative was to wait quite a while 
for a new shipment.

          <text>P.I.T.C.H.
 
1) Every nation (or people) constitutes a specific context or environment. 
2) Every companys performance is the result of 
the dynamic interaction between its environment  (where it 
is), its organization  (what it is) and its strategy (what it does). Therefore, every national context will have 
a definite impact on a companys 
performance there. This is true for local companies (companies that 
originate there) and for local uni
ts of foreign companies. 
3) One of the major challenges i
n international business and international management is to recognize such 
national context specificity. Such recogni
tion would allow managers to know which elements of the 
organization and strategy of their company 
are local (peculiar to the local national context) and which
ones are strictly local (valuable only in the local national context). 
4) I propose a simple model of nati
onal (local) context or environment, made of five related pieces: 
P.I.T.C.H. Each nation has its own pitch, so to speak. 
5) The P. stands for the local physical environment (geography or nature). It is the most visible piece. Is 
it an island or a vast 
continental space? Near the sea or inland? In the north or in the south? Cold or 
warm? A fertile ground? With mi
nerals? With oil? And so on. The local P. determines the relative 
presence of natural resources, the extent of certain 
businesses, and the importance of certain needs and 
preferences in its population. 
6) The I. is the institutional context, the set of local institutions. Examples of local institutions, formal or 
traditional, are the local l
aws, government, political system, judicial system, education and training, the 
national innovation system, financial 
markets, economic and business systems, and so on. Institutions 
are visible, namely to the 
trained eye: political scientists, lawyers and economists are good sources of 
information on local instituti
ons and on how they shape business and companies.

6)	 Customers and consumers across borders are therefore not just different in expectations and preferences on 
product features and functionalities, but also in their expectations on product quality, delivery terms, pre- and after-sales service, and so on. Customers with exacting wants are relevant as they continuously press their 
suppliers into better products and lower prices, let alone making them comply with agreed-upon quality and service 
levels. High customer exigency leads to incrementally improving company performance  or to customers and consumers who will be easily dissatisfied and who will not be silent or passive about it. 
7)	 Some users and 
consumers are also particular in that they tend to have today the needs that the rest of the 
market has tomorrow. They are referred to as lead users, following von Hipel. A lead user may also be 
demanding, but these are two different things. A lead user cares for the functionality that the product brings 
about, namely the new functionality or features that existing products do not have. Lead users tend to be early adopters of a new product, as they will not mind substituting the solution of their unmet needs for an yet 
imperfect product or a relatively high price. Because they use the new apparatus, the new service, or the new good 
earlier than other users, they will accumulate more knowledge about such use than what others can  namely tacit 
knowledge. Their motivation for using a new product early on, learning about it and eventually improving it, 
overwhelm any costs of such endeavours. Lead users are instrumental to companies in bringing about innovative and improved products when they launch them into the wide market. Lead users hold valuable amounts of user 
knowledge of particular products or applications; they are a cause of local industry leadership. 
8)	 Lead users are 
not equally distributed in the world. Different countries, with different pitch, will produce lead 
users of some product categories but not others. So, though you may know the lead users in your country, they may be foll
owers of lead users in another country. Some examples: Italian men are lead (and demanding) users 
of high-fashion. It should not be surprising that Italian companies are leading the world of high-fashion for men, though it was not always so. Until the 60s, British men were lead users of fashion and Savile Row, in London, was the 
symbol of British industry leadership in men's clothes. But, as Italian men surpassed British men with bright colors, looser cuts and lighter materials, so did Italian fashion designers and companies.

          <text>10Different Nations, different geography, 
different businesses/markets 
1) The point here is that the P., the physical context of each nation, matters. The table on previous slide exhibit 
differencesin the consumption per capita, in kilos per year, of a very mature beverage: coffee. Such differences 
can't be attributed to newness in different markets. In all the countries listed (and even not in the list, such as 
the UK), coffee has been a common beverage for decades if not centuries. A major explanation of the large  
differences in consumption is climate (and average amount of sun light). When we consume a cup of coffee, we 
are consuming hot water (a very efficient intake of energy), and tasty water for that matter (apart from caffeine). 
People in warm countries 
dont really need that: Italian and Brazilian solved the matter with very small cups of 
coffee (and a lower consumption 
per capita, despite the love for espresso in Italy and the fact that Brazil is the 
worlds largest producer of green 
coffee). 
2) Some differences in the consumpti
on of coffee remain unexplained with P.. Japan is cold and low in coffee, but 
it addressed the same needs wi
th the consumption of tea (caffeine is also present in many sorts of tea). Likewise 
with the UK, which turned 
into a tea-drinking kingdom by historical accident during the reign of Charles II. Japan 
and the UK here show that not 
only P. but also H. and C. matter in the differences of local tastes and preferences, 
and therefore of perceived value 
by local customers, users, or consumers. 
3) It is not just consumption 
rates. With different tastes and preferences come different products and eventually 
different technologies, different 
local competitors, different businesses. The business of coffee in Finland, Italy 
and the US are quite di
fferent, and so are the companies that exhibit the larger market shares in each national 
market: a Finish company i
n Finland, an Italian company in Italy, and an American company in the US  despite 
the fact that the business of 
coffee has been under international consolidation for decades and is highly 
concentrated. And all three national 
market leaders are multinational companies too. Indeed, we should say 
businesses of coffee and not busi
ness of coffee. 
4) Other businesses (such as green 
electrical power or ethanol for cars) are highly shaped by local geography and 
local regulations, which 
tend to follow nature too. It should not be surprising that Brazil produces a lot of 
hydroelectric power or that i
ts excess sugar cane turned first into ethanol for cars  and the flex car engine (P. 
shapes T. too, and T. shapes busi
ness). One should not be surprised that American homes and cars are large, 
and that Japanese homes and cars 
are small. After all, size, population density, and the vastness of land matter  
and more so when energy prices 
were low.

          <text>Nations matter! (cont.) 
5)	 Our national communities are shaped by the local natural resources, by the local climate, by the local geographic 
position, and by the surrounding communities. As local collective entities, we found the solution of recurring 
problems by shaping institutions  and recurring problems are not the same in all locales. And we found collective 
meaning and motivation by shapi
ng our local culture over long stretches of time. Our national history  is there. 
There is nothing we can do to transform our past, and even the shadow of the future shapes our collective 
feelings and will. 
6)	 National differences matter in many respects. A nation shapes each business there: the needs of customers and 
users, the expectations of shareholders, the behaviour of competitors, the available technology, and so on. 
7) Nations matter for company performance . This is of great relevance for managers and investors. Nations shape 
company performance in three ways: nations directly affect a companys organization and strategy (product and 
market choices, business models, expectations and skills of employees, beliefs and values of managers, and so 
on); nations shape the international performance of their local companies; and more visibly, nations cause 
foreign companies to adapt to their peculiar features when such companies cross borders to become MNCs. 
8)	 The fact that one company is successful, even very successful , in its nation (country) of origin does not mean that 
the company will be successful elsewhere, or everywhere. So, your company success at home does not mean 
that you will succeed abroad, at host. Retailers such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour or nationally acclaimed Natura 
and Starbucks provide first-class instances. 
9)	 The fact that your company is successful abroad does not mean that the company itself is the primary cause of 
such success. Such primary cause may simply be its origin: home is the key success factor of the companys 
success abroad. IKEAs success in furniture is primarily because it is  Swedish. 
10)	 The fact that your company is unable to achieve world-class performance may also be caused by its home 
attributes. If management is capable of freeing the company from geography, its performance may dramatically 
improve. Acer, AmBev and STMicroelectronics provide evidence of such homeless or a-centered performance. 
11)	 Because nations evolve, time matters too. IKEAs prized business model was developed in Sweden during the 50s 
and 60s (the period after WWII). Counterfactual history tells us that the same is unlikely to happen now. The 
home effect also varies as industries evolve over time; GM is a case in point.

          <text>Different Nations, different "business systems"  
1) Different nations exhibit different institutions (I.), among which the institutions of business (such as competition, 
both as a practice and 
as a law) and forms of capitalism. Indeed, one can argue that the power of capitalism is 
that there isnt one: Ameri
can and British capitalism may be similar, but French capitalism, German capitalism, 
Japanese capitalism, 
Chinese capitalism, and so on, are all local and different. Different culture and institutional
contexts foster different patterns of company ownership, different systems of relation among companies, and
different kinds of management: different national business systems in a global world, as Gordon Redding put it.   
2) There are differences in how competition works in different countries. In Japan we find a practice of intense 
competition among local companies, exemplified by the forceful retail of competing consumer electronics in 
Akihabara, Tokyo. In Canada, for example, we find an institutionalized oligopoly among banks, which many have 
identified as the cause of stability in the recent global financial debacle of 2008. I n Brazil, we find a company 
such as AmBev, created in 2000 by an authorized merger that led to an impressive position of market dominance,
which was unfair and unacceptable by most other national standards. Anti-trust is not universal either: GE was a 
authorized by Washington to acquire Honeywell, only to be blocked by Brussels  much to the surprise and chagrin 
of Jack Welsh, who so discovered that even being first is not advantageous everywhere. 
3) Different national business systems and regulatory institutions have an impact on the performance of local 
companies and on the performance of local units of foreign companies. Company acts, labour law, tax systems, 
pricing rules, competition law, and government procurement policies are among the more obvious elements of the 
local administrative and economic regimes that shape company choices and results. A foreign company will be 
affected by the local directives on cross-border transfer of funds and profits, double taxation treaties, and visa 
permits. Local ownership and governance rules may well determine the entry mode of a willing foreign investor 
(for example, by imposing a joint-venture with local partners). 
4) The local institutional context may have voids, as is regularly argued about emerging markets or 
underdeveloped economies. Though voids are in the eye of the beholder, the fact remains that the 
institutional context is largely visible from the outside, even in that in which it may be less transparent. If a 
company chooses to enter a country, it should not complain later on the negative effect of some local rule or 
practice that it could and should have known before it entered. Googles surprises in China are, well, surprising.

          <text>Different Nations, different customers and users (cont.) 
9)	 The lead users of PC chips were American for long. Companies such as IBM, HP, Compaq or Dell were 
the forefront of innovation in PCs and challenged and were challenged by Intel with the ever evolving 
x86 chips. A matter of history (IBM invented what came to be the PC) and national scientific and 
technical leadership in semiconductors and IT. American users of computers, be it in military or business 
applications, were also lead users relative to other countries. The growth of the laptop PC and the 
internet were going to change that for a while. Suddenly, the lead users of Intel chips were not American 
companies but Taiwanese companies (such as Acer and Asus), as Taiwan became the dominant origin of laptop production and engi neering. Asus even invented a new kind of laptop, the netbook. The new 
lead customers of chips wanted extended battery life, not fast computing. And another kind of lead user 
came up: the users from emergent economies who required a much, much lower price  level even if at 
the expense of some features less desired. The zero-segment that Intel had successfully 
addressed with the Celeron was now replaced by a below-zero and altogether different kind of 
demand.  
10)	 It i
s not yet easy to predict when the attributes of a countrys pitch will produce demanding or 
advanced users of a particular product class. History and culture 
are good points to start. Japanese 
women were demanding and leading users of skin cosmetics long ago, and probably still are for some 
kinds of products. French women seem to be most advanced and knowledgeable consumers of perfumes 
 which Japanese women will rarely use, if ever, on traditional and cultural grounds. Brazilian are very 
demanding and advanced consumers when it comes to entertainment, and the prime time TV soap opera 
better begin on time every day (interesting, that suddenly even Brazilians value punctuality). In some businesses, spotting demanding and lead users internationally is not trivial. Where in the world are the 
most exigent and innovative users of retail? And why?

          <text>Metaphors, Metaphors 
 
1)	 National languages are different, so much so that we find ourselves easily lost in translation. There isnt even such 
thing as a universal English. This is not good news for managers when they cross national borders. 
2)	 We frequently use metaphorical 
language for it can greatly improve communication. Local communication, that is. 
Metaphors may be very dysfunctional in international communication, as they are often highly local and context-specific, their meaning particularly confusing for a foreigner. 
3)	 The book title The Worl
d is Flat presents a nice paradox. The World is Flat caused an outburst of counter-
arguments from Europe and elsewhere, claiming that it was wrong and
 that the world was not flat. By this, it was 
meant that the world is not the same everywhere, that differences subsist even after globalization. What is interesting is that the main thesis of The World is Flat is not that the world is becoming the same everywhere. Its 
author is an American writing for his fellow Americans. The title metaphor must therefore be understood in the 
American context (again, a national difference altogether). Part of the so-called American dream is the equality of opportunities, a level playing field. What the author means (an insight from a conversation with an Indian 
CEO) is that in todays world the opportunities of a company created in Bangalore or in Silicon Valley are the same, or quickly becoming the same. It is not that the world does not have differences and barriers, but that such 
barriers no longer constrain 
definitively the entrepreneurial ability and technical skills of distant people in less 
developed countries, nor do they protect the advantage of those in developed ones. Interdependence, no less. 
4)	 What do you make of the 
head of the Boeing 777 project team stating that the plane was going to be designed as 
a Fisher Price toy? Or the English colleague who 
utters, thats not cricket, after you decided to offshore an 
activity? Think twice before using metaphors or analogies with foreigners. Or if you really have to, try using universal or quasi-universal metaphors  but check them out, just in case. What about pitch for a nation? 
5)	 You may hear that all 
words are metaphors. Most are dead metaphors indeed. But that is besides the point. The 
point is about the crucial differences in language and the use of language across nations. If all words were 
metaphors, you just had one more incentive to learn another language  namely if your native language is 
English.

          <text>P.I.T.C.H. (cont.)
 
7)	 The T. is the local technological environment, which refers to the ways in which locals do what they do and 
the proficiency with which they do it. We may distinguish the scientific and the technical contexts. The local 
craftsmanship and technological knowledge are not just about designing and making things, but also 
about using things (be it goods or services). The T. is often in direct relation with P. (for example, 
natural medicine, flex car engines, or deep sea drilling), cultural traditions (for example, culinary), and 
institutions (for example, universities, research institutes, or arts and crafts schools). 
8)	 The C. stands for cultural context, or local (national) culture. Culture is our collective  view of the world . 
National culture, following Ed. Schein, is a set of basic assumptions that defines what we  as members 
of a nation  pay attention to, what things mean, how to react emotionally to what is going on, and what 
actions to take in various kinds of situations. Culture is collective (note that one individual does not have a culture, one belongs to a culture) and implicit. Culture is mostly invisible and it can only be 
inferred. Certain collective values and beliefs can be revealed and cultural artifacts and behaviours can 
easily be observed. Anthropologists and other specialists are trained to observe and study local cultures. 
National culture has a pervasive effect on organization and on management itself  and, unsurprisingly, 
such effect is mostly invisible to its managers and employees. 
9)	 H. is of course the 
historical context, or simply history. It is the piece that we cannot experience nor see 
unless for recent history or for some figments of the past. We can only hear or read about it. In this sense, the H. is the other extreme compared to the P. The H. has a significant impact on C., but it also shapes T. and I. 
10)	 P. and H. are crucial pieces of local context in the sense that they are both real (that is, outside current 
human will). However, for the first time in human history, current T. in selected nations (nuclear power, 
carbon production) can, or may, have a very relevant impact on P., not just locally but elsewhere, even 
everywhere. Or, put otherwise, a single nation or a small number of nations can destroy the whole world.

          <text>A model of Organization
 
 
 - People is the set of individuals in the organization, with their individual traits, style, experience and skills. It  
includes particularly all its managers: the general manager (CEO), the top management team and the other managers. If we 
take the whole organization, it will include also the other employees , and even outsourcing agents that are closely 
intertwined with the people of the organization in their daily activities.  
 
 - Managerial Mindset  refers to the principles, values and frames of reference shared by the general 
manager (CEO) and the management team. The purpose of the company, its vision, and its goals are elements of the managerial mindset and express the intent and dreams of the management team. The managerial mindset determines 
what is right, good, and beautiful for the organization  and therefore guides the managers in their choices. 
 
 - Structure is the organizational structure, i.e. the differentiation of roles, location, information, and authority  
(decision rights) and their integration through a number of coordination and control mechanisms. The structure includes the 
pattern of relations between the individuals and units that make up the organization, be it the formal relations (the org chart) and the informal relations (the network). 
 
 - Processes include, in general, the decision making processes in the organization, be it resource allocation 
(budgeting, headcount and capex planning,), conflict resolution, and the handling of exceptions. Specifically, it includes 
information processes and people processes. (N.B. These are the processes that make the organization be (the physiology of  the organization), not the activities/processes that are elements of Strategy(such as delivering a solution to a client).  
 
 - Performance Metrics is the set of indicators (quantitative and qualitative) used in the company to measure 
the individual, unit, and organization level performance.    
 
 - Incentives include the instruments of recognition, retribution, and motivation of managers -- and other 
employees -- for their own performance: the salaries and equivalent; the bonus systems and other special  rewards; and the career and promotion rules.

          <text>Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
12)	 High global integration also brings a higher value captured though higher price because of higher willingness-to -
pay and superior 
ability to compete globally. 
13)	 Industrial economi
sts were among the first to look into how competition woul d change in an open world. Take the 
popular five forces model by economist Michael Porter. If the forces that matter in one industry are all by local 
agents (suppliers, buyers, rival incumbents, new entrants, and substitutes), then the industry will behave as a domestic industry in different countries (hence, multi-domestic), even in a global world. The global integration 
impact on product prices and on factor prices will be zero or very small. However, if one or more forces have 
international reach, then the industry is global.  The case of multipoint competition is illustrative. Company A 
competes wi 
th company 
B in country X and in country Y. If A lowers the price in X and forces B to lose an 
important deal there, then B can lower its prices in Y to cause even greater damage to A. The country manager 
of A in Y wont know what hit him, and may not even suspect that the cause of such loss was an act by his 
colleague managing A in X. In an industry where incumbents reach internationally, global integration keeps the 
average price higher by coordinating pricing within the company across countries and by stopping or minimizing 
local competitive races to the bottom. Another instance: facing up to a powerful international buyer or supplier 
will imply coordinated sales or purchasing negotiations across countries. A non-integrated MNC supplier will have 
lower bargaining power when facing a more integrated MNC customer, who can better gather and put to use information 
about the procured product market conditions, pricing and terms around the world. 
14)	 Higher average price will also result from a higher willingness-to-pay by local and global customers that will value 
the global positioning of the MNC as we saw above with the customer value proposition of global integration. 
15)	 The coordination and control of sales and prices across borders inside the MNC can also keep the world average 
price higher by eliminating or minimising the viability of grey-trade (when a local customer buys from a MNC and is able to re-sell the same goods in another country in competition with the same MNC or its official 
distributor there). These practices usually fall under local and international competition laws.

          <text>Global Integration: The value propositions
 
1)	 Global integration is not equally advantageous to all companies in all businesses. One needs to assess the 
economic and financial value of global integration, for the cost of global integration is granted and noticeable 
(namely for the multi-domestic MNC). There is no benchmark here. However, if the extra value of global 
integration is not substantial (say, 15% or more of your top line), it may be wiser to reconsider it. However, 
failure to globally integrate may simply mean going out of business, in which case it becomes an imperative, not 
an option. When estimating the value propositions of global integration, the base case is the same MNC with 
autonomous country subsidiaries. 
2)	 High global integration brings added value to customers or users (and higher willingness to pay) because of one 
or more of the following factors: market specialisation; proximity to customers; integrity; and serving global customers. 
3)	 The active proximity to local customers is particularly valuable during customer acquisition, business negotiation, 
and delivery, more noticeably in the provision of services and solutions. Behaving like a drone will not satisfy a local customer that values a supplier that is easy to work with, flexible and able to perform real time adjustments. If the MNC supplier is seen as distant or slow, this will easily generate a perception of unreliability 
and turn into loss of business. However, this is valid for all MNCs as suppliers, globally integrated or not. What the 
globally integrated MNC can achieve by being proximate to its local customers is to access the knowledge of users 
in the products lead country market, even tacit and locally-specific knowledge, as well as to learn how to respond 
to the most demanding customers in the world and convey such knowledge internally to its other units around the world. In both cases this will potentially turn into differentiated offerings and superior value proposition to 
local customers everywhere. For example, an integrated MNC can augment their offering to a local customer by 
throwing in the role of international knowledge broker. Accenture, for example, can benefit a local ERP 
implementation by adding the knowledge it gained from its experience of similar implementations in more 
advanced contrives in the clients industry with due respect for third-party IP. This will most likely increase the performance of the client, or be perceived as such. Local suppliers or local units of non-integrated MNCs cant 
easily offer that.

          <text>Global Integration
 
1) As the world becomes globally integrated, so does the production and delivery of many goods and services. The 
global supply chain is now a 
common feature in many industries. Made in the World is becoming the norm. 
Printed on the back of an iPhone, you 
will read: Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China. Implicit is 
the statement that the various components are made i
n many countries. The iPhone is a good instance of national 
specialization along the val
ue chain. 
2) In the case of apparel, Li &amp; Fung i
s one remarkable instance of an innovative global business model that relies on 
the global integration of production acti
vities by local companies. Li &amp; Fungs part is to locally differentiate and 
globally coordinate and control the whol
e process (what the company calls orchestration). This model can be 
replicated in many other businesses. A
pparel was a good candidate to begin with, for it is a very mature business 
with international trade involved for 
over one century. Note that the business of Li &amp; Fung is not international 
trade (nothing new there) but rather international 
management. This is the novelty. A relatively small 
multinational company manages the business of 
thousands of local companies around the world. In the past, 
such activity would have very high 
transaction costs and, if it had existed, it would be inside a large multinational 
company, not in a global world. The more global the world, the less important multinational companies will be in 
terms of numbers of employees and value of 
fixed assets. In a global world, even local companies will have a 
global strategy within a global network 
of partnerships. This still has a long way to go, but i s one way. 
3) The Renault-Nissan alliance provides 
yet another model of global integration, in this case through a strategic 
alliance between two large MNCs 
from distinct countries. 
4) However, just a couple of decades ago, the norm 
for multinational companies (MNCs) was not global integration 
but local autonomy in the the so-call
ed multinational or multidomestic model, in which country subsidiaries 
were rather self-sufficient and geared towards the 
optimization of local performance (e.g., country P&amp;L). The high 
autonomy of many local units made them known 
as fiefdoms and the respective country managers were 
barons. Several MNCs spoke of their worldwide federation of national units with pride. They saw the world as 
a portfolio of country markets. 
5) The global integration of production and 
delivery started early for some companies. Some GIEs (globally 
integrated enterprises, as IBMs CEO Sam Pal
misano called them) were already visible in the 80s. As one might 
predict, the GIE movement began in 
industries with high economies of scale in R&amp;D and manufacturing: cars, 
consumer electronics, and semiconductors, just to name 
a few.

          <text>Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
10)	 However, the more specific efficiency effect of global integration lies in economies of scope across countries. Such 
international scope in the MNC can easily be confused with scale. Economies of scope derive from the use of the 
same asset to produce two (or more) different products or activities. Economies of scale come from it producing 
twice or more of the amount of one product or activity. The confusion between scope and scale in the MNC 
comes from the fact that global markets are rare, and therefore most goods and services are somewhat locally 
adapted. Such localization in a non-global world meant one factory per country with local scale. In a global world, 
it means one factory capable of producing several country variations of the product. There will be economies of 
scale in the production of the common parts or global platform of the product, and economies in scope in the 
rest of the product. However, if one considers the economics of the whole product, then what we should 
account for are economies of scope across countries, for that is the source of variation. If one repeatedly 
focuses on economies of scale, there may be the usual and uncalled for confusion between aggregation and 
integration, the belief that globalization requires standardization of the product across borders. The potential for economies of scope is yet very large in all functions and tasks, including management. Many MNCs have now 
dispensed of country head offices, and one regional office manages selected activities in a number of countries. 
Again, note that overseeing sales in Spain and Portugal are 
not the same activity (local languages differ, labour 
and commercial law are different, buying patterns are different, and so on). One should not state that a central 
office in Madrid for the whole of the Iberian Peninsula provides an economy of scale across the two countries  
what it constitutes are economies of international scope. For what has happened in some cases is that the Madrid 
office starts to treat sales in Spain and Portugal as if the two were the same. The corollary is poorer top line 
performance, usually superior to the realized economies of scale (literally, in such case). 
11) Flexibility across borders is a particular source of lower costs or higher returns in the integrated MNC. There are 
two sources of advantage here. One is the flexibility of diverting operations to another country unit in the 
presence of local surges in demand, local shortages of inputs, or local disasters. The other is the arbitrage of 
factor costs, namely on the price of inputs that are immobile or non-tradable across borders, such as energy 
prices, labour rates, tax rates, licensing rights, or exchange rates. The ability to draw on flexibility in the MNC calls for redundant capacity by design; worldwide information on current capacity utilization, short term requirements, 
and factor prices; as well as suppleness in capacity planning and procurement routines across countries. Flexibility 
in the MNC also reduces the bargaining power of local unions as the threat of activities being sent abroad is 
credible. Unions have responded by coordinating their actions across countries (globalization is for all...).

          <text>Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
16)	 A note on the transfer of best-practices: The international transfer of best-practices is not a trademark of the 
globally integrated MNC. Any local unit of any MNC or even any local company can benefit from sourcing 
knowledge abroad. Such transfer is difficult and costly anyway because of the messy and sticky nature of 
knowledge (for example, technical know-how and operational skills are markedly tacit and context-specific). 
However, global integration creates the conditions for superior transfer of best-practices in two ways. Even before 
the transfer begins, the receiving unit must be aware of the very existence of the different practice abroad and 
whether it constitutes a best-practice. And then it must be able to source it, which may simply be impossible or very costly if the IP is owned by a competitor. The globally integrated MNC addresses these access difficulties by 
institutionalizing internal contests and exhibitions of best-practices, technical steering committees, cross-country 
functional teams, centers of excellence, and through the mutual visits of local managers around the world or via 
the information exchange at the eGLT. We also know that the transfer of best-practices depends on the 
absorptive capacity and motivation (the skill and will) of the receiving unit, and on the quality of relations between the sending and receiving units. Again, the global integrated MNC fosters a corporate context in which 
such factors can be addressed with team spirit across countries, complemented with training in-context and 
special performance appraisal metrics and incentives. So, the 
transfer of best practices is not specific to global 
integration, but a globally integrated MNC can benefit from a more effective and efficient transfer of best-
practices across its units around the world. Therefore, global integration causes a better performing transfer of 
best-practices.  
17)	 And what about risk? Global integration may sharply increase economic performance and financial returns, but it 
will also increase risk. The multi-local MNC diversifies country risk, the globally integrated company amplifies 
enterprise risk. That is the hallmark of interdependence. What happens anywhere can affect everywhere. Note 
that the root cause of such added risk is the global world we live in. Even a multi-local company can suffer from 
the domino-effect of a failure across countries. What is special about the global integrated MNCs is that structural 
choices made by the company render its units in each country dependent on units in other countries, irrespective 
of what happens in the world. An operational failure in one country may turn into higher costs in many countries. 
A global customer poorly served in one country may react everywhere. The internal and external global risk 
amplification may produce very nasty effects, as the recent Toyotas sudden acceleration case shows.

          <text>The Strategy of the MNC as Multinational
 
1)	 The multinational company (MNC) is particular because its organization spans different countries, not because it 
does business in different countries. The MNC is a multi-unit hierarchy with units in two or more countries. 
Managing in a MNC is particular in that one manages with, and for different peoples in their respective 
national contexts. 
2)	 The strategy of a MNC as a MNC has to include an organizational value proposition. Any description of a MNC 
strategy without such organizational element is incomplete. This MNC-specific strategy element has for long been 
established as global integration. 
3)	 National responsiveness and global integrati
on constitute the two fundamental factors of the economic (value 
created) and financial (value captured) performance of the MNC. 
4)	 National responsiveness refers to how the M
NC responds to the economic, political, and organisational forces 
that arise from the differences and similarities across nations. Nati
onal responsiveness choices are content 
choices embodied in two kinds of specialization. One is local specialization (or local adaptation or 
localization): the extent to which the product and the activities of the MNC in each country are specific to the national context there (i.e. dependent on the local pitch 
and applied only there). Local specialization optimizes local 
performance (say, the country unit P. &amp; 
L.). The other is international specialization: the extent to which locally 
specific product features and activities in a particular country apply to the world or to a set of countries. 
International specialization optimizes local and global performance. For example, if a MNC decides to have a 
center of excellence of design in Milano, Italy for Europe, that is international specialization there; if the same 
MNC decides that its products for Italy will be branded with Italian names, that is local specialization." 
5)	 Global integration determines the overal
l (global) organization of the MNC. The global integration of a MNC 
reflects the value of the union of the country units that constitute the 
MNC. Global integration is not  at all  the 
extent (let alone the increase) of similarity or standardization across country units in the MNC. Choices of 
similarities and differences are national responsiveness choices. 
6)	 Note that the local organizational choi
ces in each country unit of a MNC depend also on its global integration. 
Only if global integration is zero (the MNC is 
a pure portfolio of country-business units) would the local 
organization in each country be a consequence of the business strategy there (i.e. the local unit of the MNC would 
be equivalent to a local indigenous company).

          <text>Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
4)	 Local units should be specialists of local demand and be intimate with local lead users, local demanding customers 
and local non-customers. Such local market knowledge (for example, what product attributes local customers 
value more and value less, now and tomorrow) is then brought into the product design and development 
processes together with that from colleagues from other country markets. It is this comparative  and parallel 
process of product design and development that will optimize the value for the various local customers while aggregating those features that are commonly shared across borders (the 
global product platform , as is called 
in some industries). A product is no longer the ad-hoc adaptation of a home-based design to each local market (a 
sequential process, regularly sub-optimal), but a globally integrated design. 
5) Integrity and reputation are valuable in all businesses and paramount in some, be it goods such as 
pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, or cars, or services such as healthcare, auditing, or corporate banking. This is not new in a global world. What is new is that an incident anywhere, even in a small and remote location of the 
planet, will quickly be turned into worldwide news. Customer trust and investor goodwill everywhere can be lost in 
a blink of an eye. Just recall that Arthur Andersen, an old, large and highly respected auditing firm by all over the 
world, disappeared in a fortnight after the Enron imbroglio, which was traced to a failure by a relatively small office in Texas  of which most partners around the world had never heard of before. The recent BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is another case in point  and the BP chief executive had never heard of that platform either. 
This has a direct bearing on global integration, for both local failures and ineffective responses are indicators of a 
non-globally integrated organisation, particularly one where local performance optimization is managed 
irrespective of global risk, and where global compliance and global oversight are lacking. Arthur Andersen and BP 
are exemplary in these respects too; in the instances above, and given the high status and businesses of the two institutions, what the world did not forgive was the obvious lack of compliance with professional and safety 
norms. One for all is even more effective in the negative. 
6)	 A global customer finds value in a MNC supplier that is equally integrated or more so. The particular needs of a 
globally integrated customer include the coordination of procurement and delivery across borders, joint worldwide capacity, logistics planning and review meetings, flexibility in delivery locations, worldwide quality assurance, 
global service levels, and, not least, global pricing agreements. A non-integrated MNC supplier is disruptive to a 
MNC customer in the process of integrating as the supplier local units will act as centrifugal forces to the 
customer local units.

          <text>Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
7)	 High global integration brings lower costs because of the following factors: specialization; scale; scope (across 
countries); and flexibility. 
8)	 The international  specialization of operations brings lower costs through two direct efficiency effects. Focusing a 
plant or a service 
center on a particular product for a set of countries, even the whole world, brings faster 
accumulated experience, a learning curve effect. But it also allows for a units location choice that will optimize 
the local availability of world-class technicians and workers, suppliers, and knowledge spillovers from similar local 
units, a cluster effect. Furthermore, the MNC can learn first- hand experientiall y where in the world are the 
more technically savvy, 
capable and efficient suppliers, R&amp;D institutes, banks, consultants, and so on. Such deep 
access to superior technologies and other inputs will not only provide for the continuous improvement of the MNCs operations and product offering everywhere, but even bring about new breakthrough products. 
9)	 Global integration 
allows for the geographical concentration of operations. This will bring about larger economies 
of scale than even the largest country market affords (technology permitting). Historically, the Japanese MNCs in 
cars and consumer electronics that grew to prominence in the 80s (such as Toyota, Sony, or Matsushita/ Panasonic) took great cost advantage from their export-model, often based on a single plant in Japan producing 
for the whole world. Their Western competitors, established MNCs, had a large number of plants around he world, 
sometimes producing for one country only  the legacy of a non-global world. Such impact of economies of scale 
and lower prices in the growth of Japanese MNCs in such industries (at the expense of famous local and 
international brands such as Volvo, Rover, RCA, Philips, and many more) prompted scale to become the most obvious and popular effect of globalization. Bargaining power with suppliers is steeply increased by buying at a 
multi-country level. Economies of scale in R&amp;D are also very relevant in industries such as chemicals, 
semiconductors, or pharmaceuticals, where product differentiation across countries is minimal  and which were 
among the first industries to become global.  (R&amp;D intensity, the ratio of R&amp;D expenditures over sales, is one 
of the 
accepted measures 
of an industrys propensity to globally integrate.)
