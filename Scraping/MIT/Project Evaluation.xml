          <text>Minimum Attractive Rate of Return
The MARR is the lowest return that you would be 
willing to accept given:
The risks associated with this project
The other opportunities for investment
In general, we can look at the capital markets to find 
out what kinds of return are available for different 
kinds of investment
Interest rates for bonds
Historical rates or return (i.e. growth rates) for stocks 
(assuming that stocks are priced today such that they 
will offer new owners similar rates of return in the future)</text>

The interest that can be earned on the safest investments if 
there is no inflation  
A risk premium  
The inflation rate

          <text>Choosing A Discount Rate
The discount rate reflects the opportunity cost for the person 
or organization that will receive the cash flows (e.g. the 
federal government specifies a rate to be used)
The analysis can be done with real or nominal discount rates
Real rates are used in constant-dollar analyses
Nominal rates reflect expected inflation (market interest rates are 
therefore "nominal" interest rates)
The discount rate is not the same as the interest rate obtained 
to finance the project
Higher risks will require a higher discount rate
Project risks (e.g. can we build this on budget and on schedule?)
Market risks (e.g. will the market for real estate remain strong?)
Economy risks (e.g. will there be a recession?)
Country risks (e.g. will the government remain stable and 
supportive of new infrastructure projects?)</text>

A company presents information to a bank or to an 
investment banker  
Historical financial and operating results  
Business plan and expectations for the future  
Discussion of risks and opportunities  
The amount of money that can be raised depends 
upon the bankers or bond purchasers perceptions of  
The ability of the company to pay the interest over the life of 
the loan or the bond and  
The interest that can be obtained from loans or bonds with 
what they believe to be similar risks  
Interest rates are also determined by the market  
Higher interest rates are necessary to attract investors to 
what are viewed as riskier investments</text>

          <text>Discount Rates for Evaluating the 
Proposal to Construct an Office Building   
Bank One:   
Interest rates reflect risks the construction might cost more or take 
longer than expected, as well as the risk that the owner might not 
be able to refinance the loan  
Interest rates will be high  
Bank Two  
Once the building is completed and tenants have signed leases, the 
risks associated with the project are greatly reduced  
Interest rates will be lower than required by Bank Two  
Owner  
The owners cash flows depend upon project costs, timing, rents, 
and interest rates charged by the banks  
The MARR depends upon the owners other options for investment 
and past experience with similar projects</text>

          <text>Example:  
 Proposed Financing for the 
Construction of an Office Building   
Bank One provides a loan at 10% interest to cover most of the 
construction costs  
Bank One pays costs as they are incurred  
Interest is added to the balance each month  
The loan is paid off when the building is completed and long -term 
financing is obtained from Bank Two  
Bank Two provides long -term financing at 8% interest  
Bank Two holds a mortgage on the property  
Anticipated rents are deemed sufficient to cover the mortgage 
payments  
The Owner is highly leveraged and expects an IRR of 20%  
Bank One covers most of the costs of the project  
Rents are expected to cover mortgage payments to Bank Two</text>

          <text>Limits on Leveraging
Banks may limit debt to a percentage of the 
total project costs (typically 80% for a real 
estate project)
Banks may increase interest rates for highly 
leveraged companies
Investors may shun stock of highly leverage 
companies 
Owners may limit debt in highly volatile 
industries to limit risk of bankruptcy</text>

          <text>Opportunity Cost of Capital
What else could we do with our money?
Give it away
Spend it on food, Red Sox games, movies, or clothes
Put it in the bank
Buy government bonds or corporate
Buy blue chip stocks
Buy growth stocks
Buy emerging markets mutual funds
The opportunity cost depends upon what other 
options are available to us given our own situation 
and current market conditions</text>

          <slideno>11</slideno>
          <text>Leveraging
"Leveraging" is borrowing money to increase 
the expected ROI for the project
If base ROI is greater than the interest rate, 
then leveraging increases the return: 
ROI = Net income/Net Investment
       = (Income - i*Debt)/(Invest - Debt)
       = (ROI*Invest - i*Debt)/(Invest - Debt)</text>

          <text>Public Sector Financing
The public can raise money by issuing bonds 
guaranteed by the government and backed up by the 
power of the government to raise taxes if necessary 
to meet its obligations
The government may make income on some 
government bonds tax-free
BUT - the government also is raising money from 
individuals and the private sector by taxation - the 
opportunity cost is what they could do with the money
SO - there is pressure on government not to use 
discount rates that are too low (or too high)</text>

          <text>A Basic Question
For any arbitrary sequence of cash flows 
and for any interest rate i, we can find an 
equivalent cash flow that is much easier to 
work with when evaluating projects:
Present worth
Future worth, at any time t
An annuity for N periods begining at time 0
An annuity for N periods beginning at any 
future time
But - how do we choose i?</text>

          <text>Sources of Capital  
Use internally generated funds  
Equity:  
Issue stock  
Raise money without committing to interest 
payments, but also give up a portion of ownership 
of the company to new stockholders  
Debt:  
Borrow money from a bank or issue bonds  
Commit to payments of principal and/or interest, 
but retain full ownership of the company</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>20</slideno>
          <text>What is Your  MARR?  
Your MARR must be  
Greater than or equal to your weighted average cost of 
capital (not your cost of capital for this project)  
Otherwise, youre better off paying off your debt or buying back 
your stock  
Greater than or equal to your options for investing  
Your other projects, adjusted for risk  
Investment in the market  
Your MARR is therefore influenced by the market, but 
not determined by the market</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>15</slideno>
          <text>Cost of Capital for Debt Financing
Interest rates will be determined by the capital 
markets and the credit of the company (NOT the 
quality of the project)
Rates will be higher if:
Interest rates in general move higher (as happens in 
times of inflation)
If company is perceived as a credit risk
If company relies too much on debt financing
Risk bankruptcy by having high levels of interest 
payments
If company is in a risky industry 
If company operates within a risky polical environment</text>

          <slideno>18</slideno>
          <text>Cost of Capital for Equity Financing
To sell stock, you must persuade investors that the 
value of the company will grow fast enough to 
provide investors with a suitable return
In principal, investors can value the company at 
some future time, select an appropriate discount 
rate, and determine the maximum price that they 
would be willing to pay today 
In practice, investors often look at the ratio of price to 
current earnings in comparison to P/E ratios for other 
companies with similar anticipated growth rates 
(Note:  if earnings are stable, the P/E is the inverse 
of the return on investment)</text>

          <text>Discount Rates for Evaluating the 
Proposal to Construct an Office Building   
Each players discount rate depends upon 
their perception of the risks that are related to 
their portion of the cash flows.  
Owners can increase their expected return 
through leveraging  but that increases their 
risks if there are problems in construction or 
in renting the building.  
The banks can limit their risks by limiting the 
amount they loan or increasing the interest 
rates that they charge.</text>

          <slideno>10</slideno>
          <text>Risk vs. Value  
If you reduce the perceived risks of a project, 
then both you and potential investors will 
discount future cash flows less heavily  and 
the value of the project will rise.  
Some risks decline as a project progresses, 
so the value can increase over time.  
The entrepreneurs will likely have much 
different perceptions of risk than the 
investors.</text>

4. Provide quality information for use in decision making:  
 Collect qualitative and quantitative social, economic, and cultural data 
sufficient to usefully describe and analyze all reasonable alternatives 
to the action.  
 Ensure that the data collection methods and forms of analysis are 
scientifically robust.  
 Ensure the integrity of collected data.  
5. Ensure that any environmental justice issues are fully described and 
 analyzed:  
 Ensure that research methods, data, and analysis consider 
underrepresented and vulnerable stakeholders and populations.  
 Clearly identify who will win and who will lose, and emphasize 
vulnerability of underrepresented and disadvantaged populations.

          <text>Table 4.5 Principles for Social Impact Assessment  
 
1.    Achieve extensive understanding of local and regional populations and              
 settings to be affected by the proposed action, program, or policy.  
2. Focus on the key elements of the human environment related to the 
 proposed action, program, or policy  
3. The SIA is based upon sound and replicable scientific research concepts 
 and methods.  
 Research methods should be holistic in scope.  
 Research methods must describe secondary and cumulative social          
effects related to the action or policy.  
Ensure that methods and assumptions are transparent and 
replicable.   
Select forms and levels of data collection and analysis that are 
appropriate to the significance of the action or policy.

6.  Undertake project, program, or policy monitoring and evaluation and 
 propose mitigation measures if needed:  
Establish mechanisms for evaluation/monitoring of the proposed action 
that involve agency and stakeholders and/or communities.  
Where mitigation of impacts is required, provide analyses and 
assessments of alternatives.  
Identify data gaps and assess data needs.

          <text>Area of Concern        Questions  
Project design and       Have alternatives, such as upstream watershed management 
planning        and floodplain widening, been considered?  
           Will building be prohibited within a defined distance from the 
              streambed to protect the stream bank?  
          Are channel slopes graded so animals can crawl or climb out?  
Construction       Will construction take place during the dry season?  
         Will site access routes and equipment storage areas be planned 
              and located to minimize erosion potential?  
       Will construction and storage areas be sited away from critical 
             habitats?  
Maintenance      Will vegetation removal methods that use chemicals, grazing, or  
             burning be prohibited? (Chemical herbicide residuals and 
             animal wastes can be washed into waterways during rainy 
                            periods.)

	Those against say 
	VERY EXPENSIVE both to build and to operate 
	Ridership VERY uncert ain 
	Benef its are overst ated and costs u nderstated 
	Econom ic growth is really just a redistr ibution of

 Often (but not always) city center to city center --the

          <text>Social Business?
In our 6 years, Pure Home Water has explored a range of 
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) approaches 
All the M&amp;E approaches are important to us to ensure safe 
drinking water, however, our capacity to handles M&amp;E is 
limited (time, money, skill sets)
PHW has mainly focused on the double bottom line  of 
reaching high risk/low income families and attempting to be 
financially and locally self -sustaining
MIT graduate students have provided M&amp;E services to Pure 
Home Water (mapping, health, water quality, financial)
We have not succeeded yet as a social business by

          <text>How do you define and evaluate 
a Social Business?
A social business is a company that is 
cause-driven rather than profit driven, with the potential to act as a change agent in 
the world. 
A social business is not a charity. As long 
as it relies on subsidies and donations to cover its losses, such  an organization remains in the category of a charity.

          <text>Water Quality
Established for individual drinking water constituents that  
are a health risk from long- term exposure, where 
fluctuations are small or occurring over long periods
Typically expressed as guidelines values (concentrations) of the substance or chemical of concern
In Ghana, we have a established and trained local technicians in simple water quality testing for turbidity and  3 low -cost indicator tests: 3M petrifilm (E.coli and total 
coliform), membrane filtration (E.coli and total coliform) 
and hydrogen sulfide bacteria presence/absence testing.

          <text>Evaluation, Decision- Making, Values
EVALUATION is the process of analyzing a # of plans/  
projects/policies with a view to searching out comparative 
advantages and disadvantages and the act of setting down 
the findings in a logical framework. 
EVALUATION    DECISION -MAKING. Decision -making 
is done by institutional players government, and the 
political process,  engineering and scientific experts, monied 
interests.
EVALUATION is based on VALUES.

Once a social -objective-driven project 
overcomes the gravitational force of 
financial dependence, it is ready for space 
flight. Such a project is self -sustaining and 
enjoys the potential for almost unlimited 
growth and expansion. As the social business grows, so do the benefits it provides to society.

Water -related diseases are
estimated to claim 3- 7 million
lives each year. This includes 
water -borne, water -washed, water
contact diseases, as well as  water(insect) vector diseases  -i.e. those
associated with water habitat (e.g.malaria, dengue) and thus withwater resources &amp; habitat management.

          <text>Capacity of a Highway Intersection: 
Lessons  
Practical capacity is well below theoretical capacity  
Capacity can be sharply restricted by common disruptions 
(accidents, bad weather, etc)  
During peak periods of operation, demand may exceed capacity of 
the system, resulting in delays  
Practical capacity is ultimately limited by what is believed to be 
acceptable delay or the acceptable frequency of extreme delays  
 
Three useful concepts:  
Maximum capacity :  maximum flow through the system when 
everything works properly  
Operating capacity :  average flow under normal conditions  
Sustainable capacity :  maximum flow that allows sufficient time for 
maintenance and recovery from accidents</text>

Benefits:
Halved the price of coal in Manchester (a direct benefit 
of increased efficiency of transport)
Helped Manchester become England's leading industrial 
center (development benefit for the region)
Stimulation of infrastructure de velopment
By 1840s, Britain had a network of 5,000 miles of canals

Purpose:  
Improve efficiency of existing system by providing a 
better link from NH to Boston (chartered by 
Massachusetts)
Reduced transfer from barge to wagon for delivery to 
Boston (cut costs by 75%)
Costs
50 bridges, 8 aqueducts, 27 locks
$528,000 investment = $20,000/mile = 3% of assessed 
value of Boston (an early Big Dig!)
Problems
1-way freight - and not much of it
Disruption of trade (Portsmouth &amp; NH did not like this!)</text>

          <text>Summary - What Do We Learn From 
the Experien ce W ith C anals
Ideas and concepts are a round long before the 
means to build the infrastructure are available 
Major projects can be decisive in directing 
development and population growth - but it is also 
possible to spend major resou rces on projects with 
modest potential
Changes in technology can kill projects (RRs killed 
both the turnpikes and the canals) or improve them  
(efficiency gains from larger boats justified enlarging 
canals)
Financing is a major concern</text>

          <text>Morris Canal 1824-31
Purp ose:  link coal fields of Lehigh Valley with NYC
Cost was $2.1 million vs. $1 million estimate
Circuity (99 mile canal to go 55 miles)
Elevation (up 914 feet then down 750 feet)
Nota ble
Use of rail cars to haul boats up an inclined plane
Acted as their own bank to finance canal
Interfered with salmon spawning
Speeds restricted to &lt; 3 mph to avoid w ashing out banks
Needed to widen for wider boats (increased loads from 25  to 
50-75 tons
Results
"Immediate and pronounced"  - prices of coal an d wood fell in NY, 
business was stimulated , towns grew
Peaked 1860-70, then overtaken by RR</text>

What depth:  enough for freight, but no more than they 
could finance
Results
Too many boats almost from day 1 - increased in 1835 
to 70 ft wide with 7 ft depth (from 40 and 4)
Revenues exceeded all expectations
Opening up Lake Erie was "decisive impetus for 
commerce to move E-W rather than N-S

Time to walk to bus stop = Distance/average walking speed  
 
Wait for bus = Half of headway  
 
Time on bus = Distance/15 mph + 1 minute per stop  
 
Transfer from bus to subway platform = Distance/average walking

Wait for subway train = half of headway  
 
Train time = Distance/30mph + 45 seconds per stop

          <text>Meaning of PV of a Time Stream of 
Cash Flows
PV &gt; 0 
This project is better than making an investment at i% 
per year for the life of the project
This project is worth further consideration
PV &lt; 0
This project does not provide enough financial benefits 
to justify investment, since alternative investments are 
available that will earn i% (that is the meaning of 
"opportunity cost")
The project will need additional, possibly non-cash 
benefits to be justified</text>

          <text>Why is equivalence critical?  
 
    It is much more convenient to compare present values than the 
complex cash flows associated with competing projects.  
 
Why are equivalence relationships complex  and  
interesting?  
 
 What is equivalent for you might not be equivalent for me!  This is 
often the basis for planning, financing, and negotiation.   Equivalence is a Critical, Complex, and

Conclusion:  a $2 toll will be sufficient  
A sinking fund could be established to pay off 
the bonds in 30 years:  
$50 million/[F/A,4%,30] = $50 million/56.08

Effective rate of interest for more frequent compounding:  
Annually:    12% 
Semi -anually:   12.36%  
Quarterly:    12.55%  
Bi-monthly:   12.62%  
Monthly:       12.68%  
Daily:             12.75%  
 
In general, the effective rate i is a function of the nominal 
rate r and the frequency of compounding (M times per 
year):  
 
       i = [1 + (r/M)]M - 1</text>

Equivalent AnnuityF(A(t)) = A(t) * (1+i)N-t   
F(N) = A[(1+i)N-t +  + (1+i)N-t + + (1+i)0 ] 
 
(F/A,i,N) = [(1+i)N-1)]/i  The future value of an 
annuity will be the sum of 
the future value of the 
individual payments  
This results in a geometric 
sequence with a simple sum.  (F/A,i,N)</text>
