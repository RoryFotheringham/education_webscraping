          <text>The Fusion Process
D and T are both positively 
charged and repel each other 
through the Coulomb force
If D and T ions manage to 
touch then the nuclear force 
takes over and turns D + T 
He(3.5MeV) + n(14.1MeV)
Repulsion is overcome by 
increasing the speed or energy 
of D and Tin a hot fusion 
plasma, the D and T nuclei 
are hot enough to fuse

          <text>Fusion Reactors: The Ultimate Nuclear Power Plant  
 
 A fusion reactor would have  several of the attractive features of present-day 
nuclear power plants: 
 
Abundant fuel supply 
 
Efficient conversion of mass to energy 
 
No air pollution or contribution to global warming  
 
 But it would not have  the critical negative concerns that have stopped the 
development of fission reactors: 
 
No risk of uncontrolled energy release 
 
Greatly reduced quantity of high level waste 
 
Greatly reduced threat to non-proliferation of weapons material</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>Like Fission, Fusion Efficiently Converts Mass to Energy 
 
In Fission, the energy release is about 1 MeV per Nucleon 
 
In D-T Fusion, the energy release is about 3.5 MeV per Nucleon 
 
By comparison, fossil fuels are grossly inefficient, less than 1 eV per Nucleon! 
 
This efficiency translates to correspondingly smaller requirements for the fuel 
supply system and waste disposal: 
 
To generate 1000 MW in one day requires 9000 tons of coal  and generates 
30,000 tons of CO 2 (plus other noxious gases, e.g., SO 2 and NO 2). To generate 
the same amount of energy from fusion requires about 2.5 pounds of D + T and 
makes 2 pounds of He!</text>

          <text>A Fusion Reactor Would  Produce Negligible Quantities of 
High-Level Waste 
 
No Actinides are produced in the fusion fuel cycle  
The neutron from D-T fusion will cause some activation as it interacts with 
material walls. But structural materials can be used which minimize the 
production of radioactive isotopes and their environmental consequences.  
Advanced designs for fusion reactors permit recycling of materials or shallow 
burial about 100 years after shutdown.</text>

          <text>A Fusion Reactor Would Have Abundant Fuel Supply (Contd)  
 
 While the first generation fusion reactor would burn D-T, a second generation 
reactor would likely burn only Deuterium. This requires some advance of 
present day plasma physics, but would greatly simplify the fuel cycle.</text>

          <text>Fusion Power Generation
In steady-state, the energy from 
the fusion reactions are radiated 
to the first wall and blanket.
Tritium is not available naturally 
but can be readily bred with 
lithium.
The 14.1MeV neutron is 
absorbed into a blanket 
containing lithium in order to 
breed tritium.
The hot blanket and first wall is 
cooled; the thermal energy Is 
extracted from the coolant for 
power generation.Superconducting

          <text>A Fusion Reactor Would Have Abundant Fuel Supply 
 
 The first fusion reactor would probably burn two isotopes of Hydrogen, 
Deuterium and Tritium, which differ from Hydrogen in the number of 
neutrons in the nucleus.  
 
D + T  He + neutron + 17.6 MeV 
 
 The ratio of naturally occurring Deuterium to Hydrogen atoms is about 
1:6000. Said another way, there are more than 1013 tons  of Deuterium in the 
surface waters of the earth. This is truly an inexhaustible fuel supply! 
 
 Tritium is radioactive ( -emitter) and decays with a half-life of about 12 
years. Therefore it does not occur naturally and must be bred in the fusion 
reactor, for example through the nuclear reaction (Natural Lithium is ~ 92.5% 
7Li) 
 
7Li + neutron   4He + T + neutron  2.49 MeV   
  6Li + neutron   4He + T + 4.8 MeV 
 
The Lithium from land deposits or sea water is sufficient for thousands of years

          <text>So, If the Potential is so Great, Why Arent We Building a 
Fusion Reactor ? 
 
We are, but why did it take so long? 
 
 Lack of Interest in Developing New Energy Resources, especially in the US.  
 
This is in spite of the following argument, which is by no means new: 
 
 Assume that the Worlds population grows to 10 billion over the next 50 
years, and that the World per-capita usage of energy doubles during this time 
(still a factor of 3 short of the US per capita usage!) Then a minimum of 
15,000 new plants operating at 1 GW will be needed by 2050. (Some 
estimates are far greater.) How will this power be generated?  
 
 As with a new generation of fission plants, the push to develop fusion may 
come from the rapidly growing energy demand from countries with rapidly 
developing economies, e.g., China and India.

          <text>In a Fusion Reactor There is No Threat of an Uncontrolled 
Energy Release 
 
The amount of fuel in the reactor at any time is sufficient to burn for only ~ 10 s. 
Fuel is continuously supplied and can be shut off by a simple valve, much like the way fuel is supplied to a gas burner. 
 
In addition, fusion reactions are easily extinguished by injection of heavier impurity gases or a poison pellet. 
 
A melt-down cannot occur! Fusion reactors are passively safe.</text>

          <text>Fusion Reactors, Like Fission Reactors Do Not Contribute to 
Air Pollution or Global Warming 
 
 There are no routine emissions from fission or fusion reactors 
 
 Interestingly, coal plants release more radioactive gases (Radon) than fission 
plants!</text>

a. The theory is essentially complete
b. Computational tools are readily  
available
c. Used routinely in experiments
There is some truth in this view

Why are tokamaks pulsed 
devices?
OH Transformer
To hold the plasma in 
equilibrium an OH-PF 
field system is 
needed
The toroidal current is 
normally driven by a 
transformer which is 
inherently pulsedPF Coil</text>

Any more problems?
The neoclassical tearing mode (NTM)
Resistive tearing mode including toroidal trapped particle 
effects
Requires a finite seed island to grow (e.g. due to 
sawteeth)
NTMs can be excited at lower than ideal MHD modes
The m=3/n=2 mode can lead to enhanced transport
The m=2/n=1 mode can lead to disruptions</text>

Equilibrium and Stability
Why separate the macroscopic behavior into two 
pieces?
Even though MHD is simple, it is still involves nonlinear 
3-D + time equations
This is tough to solve 
Separation simplifies the problem
Equilibrium requires 2-D non-linear time independent
Stability requires 3-D+ time, but is linear
This enormously simplifies the analysis</text>

What do we do now?
The best approach: 
Hollow Jprofiles 
Perfectly conducting wall
Hollow Jmeans less IM
A conducting wall raises 
the limit by as much as 
a factor of 2</text>

          <text>36
Can the resistive wall mode be 
stabilized?
Feedback may work but is somewhat complicated
Plasma flow can stabilize the mode but high flow 
velocities v vthermal are needed and are difficult to 
initiate and maintain
Plasma kinetic effects may also play an important role
This is a crucial unresolved problem in tokamak research</text>

Doesnt this mean we have 
succeeded?
No!!!
There is one crucial unsolved reactor problem
A power reactor should be a steady state device , 
not a pulsed device
Simple tokamaks are inherently pulsed devices 
because of the OH transformer</text>

Are there any problems?
Stellarators are much more complicated technologically
The magnet design in particular is complex
3-D equilibrium with closed flux surfaces can be 
calculated but with difficulty
3-D stability can be calculated but also with difficulty
Stellarators are very flexible before they are built  many 
options.  But are inflexible once they are built</text>

These are bursts of plasma energy from the plasma 
edge that occur when the pressure gets too high
MHD modes driven by the edge p and J

What is Equilibrium
We must design a magnet system such 
that the plasma is in steady state force 
balance
So far tokamaks are the best design
The spherical torus is another option
The stellarator is yet another option
Each can provide force balance for a 
reasonably high plasma pressure</text>

Is there any way out?
Possibly
In a torus there is a naturally driven transport current 
It is known as the bootstrap current JB
No current drive is required
If enough JBcurrent flows (75%), the current drive 
requirements can be dramatically reduced</text>
