          <text>Sustainability 
Social and political sustainability 
The probability of social unrest, or political 
tensions, is associated with the standard of living.  
Higher wages in dollars in general produce higher 
standards of living. 
Environmental sustainability 
The idea of this restriction is to highlight that 
higher consumption in general tends to increase 
its negative environmental impact

Domestic Demand = C+I+G When the immigrants arrive, 
they become part of the unemployed pool 
At the same demand and the same wage in dollars we have a situation of unemployment 
In the end, the wages in dollars need to decline. Either nominal wages fall, or there is a depreciation

In general the social peace shifts upward for 
two reasons 
Getting used to Misery 
If the individuals are subject to misery during a prolong 
period of time, they will tend to accept it as normal

BBNN : Increases in price of exports 
Through time, along the equilibrium 
path, the economy ends up with higher 
wages and demand.  This is the natural adjustment mechanism. 
But this salaries increase because the exports are wanted by foreigners, not because our workers are better

Domestic Demand = C+I+G BBNN : Increases in price of exports 
Increases in the price of our exports, 
increases their value. So, our exports rise as 
in the case of growth, but for a different 
reason  
At the same salaries and demand, 
the country is able to produce more! 
So, we were before in equilibrium 
but now we have a surplus in the CA The economy remains in 
the same place but now 
it has a surplus

e/w 
Domestic Demand = C+I+G Assume that we have a natural disaster that 
destroys capital but has no impact on lives 
Because the country has less capital 
production falls. For the same demand, the country will need to import goods, and is able to export less. 
CA turns into deficit During the adjustment unemployment will increase, and salaries need to fall (or currency needs to depreciate)

          <text>Public Goods 
Non-Rivalry and Non-Exclusion 
Defense: 
It is the same cost to defend 300 million people than 300 million and one.  
We cannot exclude one of the US residents from national defense. 
 
Non-Rival but Exclusion 
Cable TV:  
Turning my TV to the channel does not increase the cost to the rest of the 
users or the firm 
 
Rival but No Exclusion 
Emergency Room 
Cost of producing is higher than zero, but it is impossible to exclude people. 
Free Rider Problem: I think you should pay, but not me.

          <text>Public Good and Public Choice 
How much public good needs to be provided? 
In the private sector if you buy, means that you want 
or need. That simple.  
In the public good. Nobody is paying! So, how do we 
know how much? 
We need to know the willingness of each person to pay for 
the public good

There is NO voting rule that would satisfy the 
four criteria 
Implications to Government 
Lack of transitivity implies agenda matters 
Lack of independence implies inconsistency 
If individual rationality is desired, then one 
individual in the government has to be the 
dictator.

          <text>When democracy works? 
When preferences are singled-peak! 
The median voter is the pivotal voter 
Preferences have the first three properties 
 
In a single issue, preferences might be singled 
peak. For example, total expenditures.  
Here the majority voting does produce a single 
equilibrium which might or not be efficient. 
 
We need to vote on each issue separately

4. Unrestricted Domain 
The decision rule that has been chosen should 
work in many circumstances  
Meaning it needs to be transitive, non dictatorial 
and independent of irrelevant alternatives  for all 
possible preferences 
 
The only way to make democracy exhibit good 
characteristics is to restrict the preferences!

Lack of proper  housing Provide housing 
Quality  of goods and services is lower 
Lower skills  and worse health Provide schooling and health services.  
Usually we provide worse services 
Respect of  Rule of Law, Contracts Punishment for deviations? 
Lack  of ability to develop and maintain networks 
Lower ability to develop relationship  
More crime  and larger security concerns Punishment for deviations? 
Lack of Hope  
Lack of Planning  
Lack of ownership on their own vision and role in the

          <text>Demand for Labor 
Disappearance of the middle class  
Skilled labor is in high demand. 
Unskilled labor is in low demand for the manufacturing 
activities (the ones that create high value added). 
Technology increases the overall income of the society 
which implies an increase in the demand for services. 
More low skilled workers are hired in low value added 
activities like retail and restaurants. 
 
Demand for skilled workers is high in high value added 
sectors. 
Demand for unskilled workers is high in low value added 
sectors.

          <text>Some results 
Drop in income concentration in the 1920s was 
due to drop in capital return 
Increase in concentration is due to wage earners 
The optimistic view  
Deregulation has opened new opportunities in english 
speaking countries 
The pessimistic view  
Top earners have been able to extract higher rents 
Although explanations based on technological 
progress are good, they need more than that. 
Institutions for wealth and income redistribution have 
played an important role

Piketty 
The wealthy have better opportunities and there is no 
social mobility.  
Nothing self-corrects the system. 
Technology 
There is nothing we can do. 
Computers and robots are here to take our jobs. 
Education 
We need to improve dramatically schooling 
participation, and school quality.

Data problems 
The big contribution of Piketty 
Fringe benefits like employer-provided health insurance 
have risen from about 8 percent of compensation in 
1960 to about 20 percent today. 
Most of the previous studies do not include this income 
as part of the salary  
Most studies never studied the 0.01% of the population 
because they were never surveyed

          <text>Physical Properties of Currency 
Divisible A currency must be divisible so that units of its value can be 
paid to match the value of your purchase.  
 
Scarce Money has to be sufficiently rare. If the medium of the 
currency is easily obtainable or reproducible, it will have little 
worth and be easily counterfeited.  
Portable For a currency to be convenient, it must be portable.  
 
 
Uniform Every unit of a currency must be equal in value. Diamonds are 
not fungible because there are other properties of a diamond 
that makes it worth more or less than any other diamond  
Durable Money must not have a property that allows it to decay over 
time. Any perishable items are a good example of this: Apples, 
Spices, Tea, Milk, etc.  
Acceptable Trusted and accepted by all

Economic Properties 
Store of value 
Money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved  and 
be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved.  
The value must remain relatively stable over time.  
Medium of exchange 
Used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services. 
For comparing the values of dissimilar objects. 
Standard of deferred payment 
Money is an accepted way to settle a debt.  
When debts are denominated in money, the real value of debts may change 
due to inflation and deflation.  
Unit of Account 
A unit of account is a standard numerical monetary unit of 
measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other 
transactions.

          <text>What are the problems? 
Money Management 
Good monetary policy needs active management of the money supply 
Shocks to the aggregate demand need to be accommodated 
Shocks to the aggregate supply should not be accommodated 
Bitcoin has a parsimonious printing 
This means that the adjustment occurs through inflation and deflation 
Asymmetry: Cost of lowering prices and wages is larger than the cost of 
increasing prices and wages 
Criminal behavior 
Anonymity and confidentiality is good for small transactions 
Verifiability and openness is good for financial transactions 
Lack of reversibility 
Some transactions need to be reversed (flash crash, and human error)

          <text>Miners 
Mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public 
ledger of past transactions.  
This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of 
blocks.  
The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as 
having taken place.  
Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions 
from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. 
Mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so 
that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. 
Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid.  
This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a 
block.  
Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof- of-work function. 
The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, 
tamper-resistant consensus.

France, Germany, Italy 
Fully funded: 
Canada, Chile, Sweden

          <text>Social Security for the first time 
 In a speech to mark the independence of 
Venezuela, Simn Bolvar (1819) pronounced 
that:  
 
El sist
ema de gobierno ms perfecto es aquel que  produce 
mayor suma de felicidad posible, mayor suma de seguridad 
social y mayor suma de estabilidad poltica. 
 
The most perfect system of government is that which produces 
the greatest amount of happiness, the greatest amount of 
social security and greatest amount of political stability.

          <text>Pension System 
Market Failures 
Incomplete Markets 
Difficult to insure Social Risk 
Lack of indexing of inflation risk 
Demographic risk and intergenerational risk 
Adverse Selection 
Imperfection in annuity markets 
Insurance companies want to give annuities to unhealthy people 
Women versus Men (lower life insurance premium, higher annuity 
premiums) 
Moral Hazard 
Individuals are underinsured if public insurance exists. 
Unacceptable Allocation 
Individual bounded rationality  
Procrastination: Saving too little 
Framing: Choices depend on framing 
Complexity: Immobilizes consumers without financial knowledge 
Early Retirement: Most people retire too soon

          <text>Design of Pension System 
Complex system with multiple objectives 
Policy needs to optimize  not to maximize! 
Policy needs to balance consumption smoothing, poverty relief, and insurance 
depending on social preferences 
Different systems  
Face different risks 
Affect women and men differently 
Have different intergenerational redistribution 
Tier system 
Tier 1; minimum non-contributory pension 
Poverty relief  
Tier 2; mandatory insurance:  
Replacement rate (Which is the income after retirement as a ratio of income before) 
Consumption Smoothing 
Tier 3; voluntary savings:  
Compensate for inadequate design
