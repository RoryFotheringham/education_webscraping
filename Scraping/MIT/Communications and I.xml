          <text>ISPs and applications
ISPs do more than run routers and 
forward packets. 
They run servers and participate in 
applications.
Each application has its own architecture.
This is not the Internet design, it is an 
application design.</text>

          <text>Topic 4: Ease of deployment
The life cycle of an app, or how do apps 
grow up?
In the beginning, must be end to end. No 
servers.
If successful, lots of folks get interested, and 
jump in. Leads to servers.
In the middle? How about peer to peer?
The design of an app should take into 
account how it is to grow up.</text>

          <text>Questions about applications
Who controls the servers?
Can only the ISP provide them?
Can the user select which server to use?
Is there a topological limitation on the servers?
Can my mail server be in China? (Yes)
What information has to be revealed to the 
servers? What is end to end?
Email--the contents can be encrypted.</text>

          <text>Tussle analysis
Ports would be random, not well-known.
Requires host-specific knowledge to filter.
ISP filtering (value strat, traf fic engineering) much harder.
Firewall filtering much harder.
Port scans less useful. 
Name server can be anywhere. Per-service name. 
Hard to launch location-based attack or scan on name server.
But: what names show in messages? What history?
Example of interaction between application design and 
network design.
A real des ign question for today. Not hypothetical.</text>

Think about:
App-level DOS attacks
The role of identity and attributes in the above
Defense in depth and outsourcing.
Dont be an attack amplifier.
What can be done cross-app? (support 
service?)
Common services vs. app-specific services in 
the net.</text>

          <slideno>19</slideno>
          <text>Economics of overlay networks
Overlays are:
A tool for sophisticated applications.
A tussle tool with ISPs
If the latter, who pays for them?
Cannot scale for free. (Can they?)
When overlays grow up, who will run them?
Option 1: they will be run bythe ISPs.
The major source of new ISP revenues.
Option 2: third party providers
What will make one option or another the answer?</text>

          <text>Where to start? Servers
Modern apps do not follow a simple end to 
end model.
(End to end at application level)
Remember the end to end argument?
They are full of servers and services run 
by third parties.</text>

Internet. They are not the Internet.
Many approaches to construction
Patterns of communication.
Use of end node software and server 
software.
Design considerations such as:
Ease of use and deployment, robust 
operation, low cost, simplicity, lawsuit-
proofing, easy management.</text>

          <slideno>16</slideno>
          <text>Topic 1--global addressing
Thesis: proper design of applications can 
mitigate the NAT problem, and allow us 
to architect private edge address spaces.
Use host-specific ports (e.g. RFC 2782). 
Requires extensive tussle analysis.
Use servers in global space for 
rendezvous.</text>

          <slideno>20</slideno>
          <text>Topic 3: Security architecture
Does an application-centered view help sort out 
issues? (I vote yes)
Re-factor security using tussle analysis.
Freedom from attack:
Users, end-servers,third-party infrastructure
Trusting users who want privacy
Untrusting users who want help
Third parties that want to intervene
Who trusts the servers, and how does app 
constrain this (shared keys, revealed info, etc.)</text>

March 2, 7, 9 &amp; 14 (Lehr)  Spectrum Policy 
This module of four lectures will focus on the rationales for regulating radio frequency 
(RF) spectrum and current topics associated with the reform of the mechanisms. 
We will begin by co nsidering the history of spectrum regulation and the evolution of 
wireless services from command and control assignment to auctions to the current debate 
over spectrum commons versus property rights. This will include d iscussion of issues 
pertaining to the  economic and public polic y rationales for spectrum regulation and 
why/ how traditional mechanisms need to be modified in light of evolving technical and 
industry trends for wireless services. We will then move on to an i ntroduction to the 
current debate over regulatory models to support licensed and unlicensed spectrum and proposals for spectrum management reform under consideration in the United States and 
Europe.

Some questions to consider include: 
	Please comment on the benefits/problems associated with traditional spectrum management policies. 
	What ought to be the appropriate goals (roles) for spectrum manageme nt policy? 
	What has changed in wireless technology, markets, and regulatory policy to make 
spectrum reform more likely today? What are the biggest challenges to achieving 
spectrum reform?</text>

	Property rights applied to spectrum 
	Unlicensed spectrum access 
	What are the  benefits (costs) of allocating spectrum to unlicensed use instead of

          <text>Implications
Inside the network there are only packets.
There is no understanding of higher-level 
intentions.
There is nothing like a call, or placing a 
call, in the routers design.
The routers have a limited view of what it 
means to operate correctly.</text>

          <slideno>18</slideno>
          <text>What is a protocol?
Protocol:  A specification of what can be sent 
when and in what format.
A very general term, used to describe many 
aspects of networking.
The voltage to represent a 1 or 0 on a link.
The bit sequence to represent characters (e.g. ASCII).
The format of the address on the front of the packet.
How one reports a lost packet.
From the Greek: "Glued on the front."</text>

          <slideno>13</slideno>
          <text>Is this such a good idea?
Weak expectation means Internet can run 
over anything. 
Makes the applications job harder, but not 
impossible.
So, yes, it is a good idea.
But now under attack.</text>

          <slideno>22</slideno>
          <text>The end-to-end arguments :
The lower layers of the network are not the right 
place to implement application-specific 
functions. The lower layers of the network 
should implement basic and general functions, 
and the applications should be built above
these functions, at the edges. 
E.g. move functions up and out. 
This causes function migration to the end-node.
The network should be as transparent as 
technology permits.</text>

          <text>Benefits of end-to-end
User empowerment.
Run what you please.
Flexibility in the face of unknown applications.
A network to hook computers together.
Lower cost in core of network. 
Eliminate special features. 
Rely on edge-node equipment.
More robust applications.
No unexpected failures of third-party nodes.
An example of getting it wrong: make the 
network reliable.</text>

          <text>How to share?
Computer traffic is bursty.
Older sharing method (circuit switching) 
was inefficient.
About 30 years ago, the need for a new 
mode of sharing was felt.

          <text>The service model
The other half of the Internet specification:
What is the commitment when I send a packet?
Answer: very little. 
The Internet tries it best, but makes no 
promises.
It can lose, reorder, delay, or duplicate packets. 
Usually they arrive in good order. 
If they dont--you have no complaint.

          <text>Congestion
More than you want to know in one slide
What happens if too many packets get sent?
In the short run, queues form in routers.
In the longer run, senders (are supposed to) slow down.
Why does this work? 
Application are expected to tolerate it.
But if senders do not slow down?
Out of aggression, or because they cannot.
A raging debate among designers.</text>

          <text>What a router does
When it gets a packet:
Check that it is not malformed.
Check that it is not going in circles.
Look at its destination address.
Pick the best link over which to forward it.
In the background:
Computes the best routes to all destinations.</text>

          <text>What does TCP do?
Breaks a chunk of data (what the 
application wants to send) into packets at 
the sender.
Numbers the packets.
Keeps sending them until it gets an 
acknowledgement.
Puts them in order at the receiver.

Competition in Access Networks (Gillett) 
This lecture will focus on the transition of the regulatory framework from monopoly to 
competition and the particular challenges it poses to access networks as services shift from 
telephony to broadband Internet. Discussion will focus on the effectiveness of policies for 
competition within the pipe (such as unbundling) vs. facilities-based competition among multiple pipes, in the context of current and emerging access technologies such as cable, DSL, all 
fibre networks, broadband wireless, and power lines. 
1 Four-Is Model of Communications Policy 
(Gillett) 
	Ideals : What are the goals of the policy? (Social, economic, political, technical) 
	Implementations: What statutes, frameworks, regulations, court rulings, and administrative 
bodies have been put into place in the name of achieving those goals? 
	Interested parties : Who are the stakeholders with interests in the policy outcomes? 
	Innovations : How does the emergence of new technologies affect existing 
Implementations and I nterested parties?
2 What is Broadband? 
	Broadband refers to the transition of access networks from vertical silos specific to a single service (e.g. PSTN for voice) to horizontally layered platforms (slides from Clark, 
1999) 
o	Multiple physical networks (e.g. DSL, cable, wireless) each potentially supporting 
multiple services (e.g. data, voice, video) 
	Services 
o	Data typically includes high-speed, always-on Internet access 
o	Voice and video may be supported in legacy and/or digital form 
	E.g. circuit-switched cable telephony vs. packet-switched VoIP over cable 
o	Innovation (finally) starting to appear here 
 E.g. payment models (e.g. Internet pay per use in Italy), streaming audio 
(e.g. Rhapsody), IP TV, video on demand 
o	Holy grail for service providers is the multi-service bundle 
 Capture multiple revenue streams to recover high fixed costs of access network

          <slideno>5</slideno>
          <text>o	A way to get competition even if loops are bottleneck facility that cannot be 
economically duplicated 
o	A first step vs. an endpoint?  Effectiveness of sunset clauses?  (Canadian experience) 
	Types of LLU (Slides) 
o	Full: access to the physical  copper pair 
o	Bitstream: access on the other side of the DSLAM; a.k.a.  logical  unbundling or 
shared access; note similarities to cable open access via tunnelling or source-
based routing 
o	Sub-loop: like full, in presence of hybrid fiber-copper between central switching 
office and end user 
o	Line sharing: access to only the non-voice frequency  bands on the loop 
	Implementation status 
o	U.S.: Telecommunications Act of 1996 experimented with all 3 approaches (resale, facilities-based, unbundling) 
	TA96 crafted with telephony in mind, not Internet 
	Broadband came later; unbundling provisions (UNE = unbundled network elements) largely undone by FCC and courts 
o E.C.: Regulation 2887/2000 requires unbundled access to the local loop 
	In force January 2001; later timing leads to sharper focus on relevance for broadband 
	New (2002/3) Framework: 2 of the 18 markets to be analysed for Significant Market Power (SMP) in each national context are: 
	(11) Wholesale unbundled access (including shared access) to metallic loops and sub-loops for purposes of providing voice and 
broadband services 
	(12) Wholesale broadband access (bit-stream access that permit 
2-way transmission of broadband data) 
	See OECD report for status in individua l countries as of last year (but 
note, situation changing rapidly in some since that report) 
8 Critiques of LLU 
	Pricing 
o	U.S.: Telecom Act mandated rates set by federal TELRIC (forward-looking cost) formula, with per-state proceedings to derive UNE costs/prices. 
o	E.C.: Pricing methodology not mandated.  Issue of price squeeze when retail loop prices below cost (i.e. geographically averaged retail prices, no rate 
rebalancing yet). 
	Complexity

          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>5 Facilities-based competition 
	Convergence - Broadband platforms can be constructed from multiple technologies and 
architectures, both wired and wireless 
o	E.g. cable vs. DSL. Present in most urban areas of U.S. and Canada, plus some European countries with strong cable history (esp. Benelux; OECD slide). 
	Extent of substitution?1 
o	Performance depends on architecture, technology, and (shared) backhaul provisioning. Limits are generally not hard but depend on how much provider 
wants to invest in increased performance. (CSTB slides) 
	DSL: Digital Subscriber Line; telco copper network; ~0.5-10 Mbps 
depending on copper loop length 
	HFC : Hybrid Fiber Coax; cable TV network; ~1-10 Mbps depending on 
coax cell size (bandwidth shared among 20 - 2000 homes) 
	FTTB/C/H/P : Fiber to the Building/Curb/Kerb/Home/Premises; ~10-100 
Mbps depending on architecture (PON vs. active star) 
	BPL : Broadband over Power Lines; electric utilities; ~1 Mbps depending on 
architecture 
	Satellite : ~1 Mbps shared nationwide; typically rural solution 
	3G Wireless: ~1 Mpbs 
	WiFi : 802.11 wireless LAN with unlicensed spectrum; ~10-50 Mbps; 
typically last 100 feet from wired connection, less common as mesh 
architecture 
	WiMax : 802.16 wireless MAN; ~1-70 Mbps; licensed and unlicensed 
spectrum bands; proposed for new wireless entrants (e.g. McCaws Clearwire) 
6 Critiques of Facilities-Based Competition 
	Technological possibilities vs. economic realities 
o	Technologies only get deployed as part of workable business models (more below) 
 Incumbents vs. entrants (note entrant may be incumbent in other industry, 
e.g. BPL) 
o	Duopoly in U.S. Third pipes have largely not materialized.  Why BPL and 
WiMax attract so much attention from policy makers.  But are these technologies 
more likely to fill in unserved areas than compete in areas already well served? 
	Depends critically on related regulatory reforms  
1 In economics, products are called substitutes if thei r cross-price elasticity has a positive sign, i.e. 
products A and B are consider ed substitutes if an increase in the pr ice of product A is associated with an 
increase in the quantity demanded of product B.

        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>o	Restrictions on cross-ownership (e.g. Germanys poor broadband performance in 
light of history of joint ownership of telco and cable) 
o	Requirements for interconnection and collocation (e.g. New Zealand experience) 
o	Directory listings, phone number portability, etc. (esp. telephony, VoIP) 
o	Spectrum liberalization (esp. unlicensed and other wireless broadband) 
	Not a fair fight: Unlevel playing field for facilities competition 
o	Restrictions on unconventional facilities providers, e.g. municipalities and community groups 
	Nixon vs. Missouri Municipal League  case decided by U.S. Supreme Court March 2004 (argued based on Section 253(a) of TA96, Any 
entity)  leaves municipal networking at the discretion of each state 
	European use of structural funds for public investment in communications 
infrastructure (requires wholesale-only network) 
o	Incumbent access providers enjoy advantages based in history, such as: 
 Implicit franchises, access to rights of way and utility poles 
 User base (customer information) 
 Brand name 
 Regulatory capture 
o	Incumbent networks would be more costly than entrants if re-built from scratchbut not starting from scratch.   
	Incremental investment is what matters, and this is typically less costly for incumbents. 
	Access network economics suggest limits to sustainable competitive intensity 
o	Dominance of fixed costs leads to increasing returns to scale (natural monopoly relative to expected demand). 
	High fixed costs (FC), low marginal costs (MC) lead to economies of scale: Lower cost per subscriber when costs spread over larger customer 
base (i.e. cost curve always declines with volume).  
o	Installation costs (labor, construction, tower siting, etc.) are significant 
component of overall cost, and not on a Moores Law curve. 
o	Switching/routing etc. equipment generally engineered and priced with scale economies. (Might this change?) 
	Implications for sustainability of competition: tipping? 
o	And, especially for wired networks: 
 Access costs are largely sunk. Not easy to redeploy the assets if customer 
drops service. 
 Often involve public disruption  digging streets, access to utility poles, etc. 
 These are characteristics that led in the past to natural monopoly treatment, with single franchised provider of telephone or cable TV 
service.

        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>o	Another way of looking at access economics: Tyranny of the Take Rate (CSTB) 
	When most (e.g. construction) costs incurred per home passed, rather than 
per subscriber: 
Penetration rate 5% 10% 50% 100% 
Cost per Subscriber $20,000 $10,000 $2,000 $1,000 
	Artifact of incumbent thinking?  For incumbents with high penetration (mature services) and market share, optimal technology designed to 
exploit economies of scale.  
	Entrant strategies (new services and/or small market shares) better 
supported by technology with lower up-front costs and ability to scale up 
with more investment as (or if) demand materializes.   
	E.g. cable modem; wireless cell-splitting; Sirbu and Banerjee 
OFAP proposal (fill/add PON splitters as customers emerge) 
	Related strategy: Shifting of cost to end users whenever possible. 
o	E.g. self-purchase/install cable and DSL modems. 
o	May be particularly important for FTTH, where customer boxes are still significant fraction of cost, especially when 
useful lives of different components are factored in. 
o	Extent of facilities competition will clearly vary by geography 
	Economies of scale mean its less costly  to serve higher density areas. 
	Example: If a head end or central office has fixed cost to serve from 
1 to 100,000 customers, then a town of only 30,000 people has 3x 
higher costs per subscriber for this component. 
	Higher density can also reduce the extent of the network that is 
dedicated to individual users, lowering the cost per user 
substantially. E.g. LAN access to apartment blocks in Stockholm &amp; 
Seoul. 
	National Research Council CSTB classification of types 0, 1, 2, 3 communities depending on how much competition likely to attract.   
	Based mainly on density of likely subscribers, which is a function of raw population density plus other demographic factors (age, 
occupations etc). 
 National-scale policies vs. varying local contexts (urban vs. rural) 
7 Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) 
	What is it: Entrant leases loop (access) related elements of incumbents network 
	Philosophy behind it: Enable entrants to provide broadband services without having to 
build the piece of the network that is generally considered cost-prohibitive / natural 
monopoly

          <text>3 Ideals: Broadband Challenges 
	Competition 
o	Unfavorable access network economics challenge transition away from regulated 
monopoly. 
o	Access as the tail that wags the dog for network competition. 
o	Static vs. dynamic (sustainability) 
	Discussion 
o	What other ideals may be affected by imperfect access network competition? 
o	Why might these ideals pose a dilemma for broadband policy? 
4 Implementations : Policy remedies 
	Three basic approaches in TA96 
o	Remove barriers to facilities-based competition  
o	Require leasing of incumbent telephone network elements (unbundling) 
o	Pure resale 
 Retail minus pricing 
 Enables multiple retail providers, but how interesting if single wholesaler? 
 In context of long-standing silo regulations and markets that didnt exactly disappear 
o	Fixed-line telephony 
	Retail price regulation (see Woroch chapter for more details); implicit subsidies challenged by more competitive environment (e.g. mobile phones, 
cable telephony) and unbundling rules (below). 
	U.S.: Title II common carriage legacy and associated obligations from 
Computer II and III inquiries (ONA=Open Network Architecture, 
CEI=Comparably Efficient Interconnect) 
	CIs Basic vs. enhanced services maps roughly into TA96 
telecommunications vs. information services 
 Codifying such distinctions into law made them less flexible 
 Competition from wireless (slide) 
o	Cable TV (U.S.) 
 Regulatory flip-flops on retail price regulation; mainly unregulated since 
1999. 
	Title VI: No common carrier obligations.   
	Locally franchised (usually monopoly).  Should data service revenues be 
subject to franchise fee obligations? Etc.

        <slide>
          <slideno>6</slideno>
          <text>o	Not a simple interface 
o	Collocation, operational/OSS issues 
o	Delays 
	Enforcement difficult - inherent conflict of interest 
o	Unbundling as an unnatural act for vertically integrated providers 
o	Strong need for regulatory interventions, arbitrations 
o	Japanese case as counterexample? 
	Regulatory asymmetries 
o	If unbundling is a good idea for copper, why not for other access technologies? 
 Cable open access debate, Brand X  case 
 Note: copper mainly paid for under rate-of-return regulation 
o	AlternativelyIf it is not needed in presence of facilities-based competition, why 
is copper singled out? (current FCC direction) 
o	How to regulate if facilities-based competition is geographically spotty? 
	LLU as implemented is backward-looking  
o	Does not address next generation, e.g. FTTH, expected to require lots of new 
investment . FCC: new rules for new wires. October 2004 ruling extends to 
FTTC as well. 
9 Proposed alternatives 
	Structural separation 
o	Relevance of municipal wholesale only experiments (slide) 
	Logical Layer Unbundling (CSTB) 
o	Aka open access / bitstream access?   
o	If so, same issue of QoS challenges. 
	Network Neutrality (Wu, 2003) 
o	Forget about separating anything, just try to prevent the undesirable behaviors. 
o	Distinguish between legitimate and suspect forms of discrimination by 
broadband providers. Local restrictions OK (e.g. bandwidth), Inter-Network 
restrictions not (e.g. blocking particular applications by port number).

	- the service provides the customer's sole means of access to the traditional circuit-switched public telephone network.

          <text>technical neutrality also makes it harder not to smother nascent 
services with legacy of regulatory requirements.  In this sense, 
regulations can become a competitive tool of Interested Parties (in 
this case, incumbents). 
	At the same time, inconsistent regulatory treatment across jurisdictions 
invites arbitrage (VoIP providers move to where its easiest to operate). 
	Explicit discussion of First Principles makes the ideals easier to contest. 
	Why is PSTN-style telephony regulated? 
o Economic issues discussed previously (market power/monopoly leveraging). 
	Do not generally apply to VoIP as application 
	Indeed VoIP as 3rd-party service more likely to depend on provisions that 
control others market power, such as interconnection rules 
o	But also many other political and social issues that have accreted to voice over the years as telecommunications network has become central to functioning of 
economy.  These include: 
	Lawful intercept (wiretapping; U.S. 1994 Computer Assistance to Law 
Enforcement Act CALEA).  Phone calls only?  Which equipment 
required to support (e.g. for Skype)?  Role of encryption?  Intercept is 
actually a much larger problem than just VoIP (but it can also be a convenient excuse to regulate VoIP for other unarticulated reasons, such 
as tax revenues). 
	August 2004: FCC responds to Dept. of Justice petition, issues 
NPRM on application of CALEA obligations to broadband and 
VoIP2 
o	Tentative conclusions: broadband and VoIP subject to 
CALEA (now theyre telecoms???  Inconsistent with 
FCCs Brand X and Vonage positions) 
o	A deal with DoJ for help with Brand X cert? 
	Andy Oram: What government will do in the case of VoIP, I 
think, is meet formal CALEA requirements by decreeing that all 
phone calls pass through recognized ISP servers and that the ISPs incorporate wiretap capabilities on these servers. VoIP users will go along with using servers because of the identity, presence, and security issues mentioned earlier. They will add end-to-end encryption at the customer premise equipment, and law enforcement won't be able to do anything except wring their hands again.

Convergence Case Study: Voice over IP (Gillett) 
This lecture draws on the themes developed in pr evious lectures to consider a case study of 
VoIP, arguably the converged Internet application that is furthest along in the marketplace and 
development of policy responses. 
1 Questions for Discussion 
	What is VoIP? 
	What regulatory policies does it challenge, and why? 
o	Regulatory concerns weve discussed in class already 
o	Additional telecoms-related regulations 
o	Developing country context1 
	What would a sensible regulatory model for VoIP look like? 
o	Consider horizontal layered approach 
2 The VoIP Challenge: Innovation 
	Convergence of industries and emergence of horizontal applications challenges silo-
oriented regulatory legacy 
o	PSTN: Telephony as the network and the service 
o	VoIP: Voice as an application and/or service layered on top of multiple networks (each with different regulatory legacies!). VoIP comes in multiple (and ever-
evolving) forms.  Not all forms resemble phone calls (e.g. talking while 
gaming, voice-based instant messaging, etc.) 
3 Regulating VoIP: Ideals 
	Fundamental regulatory issue: should voice as  an application be regulated same as 
telephony as a vertically integrated service? 
o	The easy answer: 
 Yes, if the rationale for regulation (ideal)  applies equally in both cases 
(consider a future with no PSTN) 
 No, if it doesnt. 
o	Issues that make real world policies more complex: 
 Regulations have to fit within statutory frameworks.   
	E.C.s 2003 framework makes process of selective application of  regulations somewhat easier than U.S. TA96 mess.  However,

          <text>Determining callers geographic location   
	More generally - Why only voice 911?  Why not 911 IM, etc.? 
	Disability access (requirements for TDD = telephone relay for the deaf.  
What about text-based messaging? SMS, IM, email etc.) 
	Common numbering scheme and phone number portability.  Issues similar to mobile in terms of non-geographic correspondence. 
	Reliability and service quality standards. Who would these apply to: network? Application vendor (e.g. Skype)?  Service provider (e.g. 
Vonage)? 
	U.S.: Taxation / state revenue. Regulate VoIP because if we dont the 
tax revenue from phone calls goes away.   
	Similar logic for cross-subsidies paid among carriers in name of universal service. 
	What should universal service actually mean once voice becomes purely an application? 
	How to pay for underlying broadband networks? 
4 Regulating VoIP: Implementation 
	It has taken a while for policies to go back to the ideals (First Principles). 
	Earliest regulatory approaches: Litmus tests.  Example characteristics that have been tried: 
o	U.S.: 1998 Stevens report paragraph 88: In using the term "phone-to-phone" IP 
telephony, we tentatively intend to refer to services in which the provider meets 
the following conditions: 
	(1) it holds itself out as providing voice telephony or facsimile transmission service; 
	(2) it does not require the customer to use CPE different from that CPE necessary to place an ordinary touch-tone call (or facsimile transmission) 
over the public switched telephone network; [so what is Vonage?] 
	(3) it allows the customer to call telephone numbers assigned in 
accordance with the North American Numbering Plan, and associated international agreements; and 
	(4) it transmits customer information without net change in form or content. 
o	E.C. (1998 framework):  voice telephony service  means a service available to 
the public for the commercial provision of direct transport of real-time speech via the public switched network or networks such that any user can use equipment connected to a network termination point at a fixed location to communicate with another user of equipment connected to another termination point. 
o	U.K. (Ofcom) under 2003 E.C. framework:  VoIP service should be regulated as 
a publicly available telephone service if any of the following conditions apply:

What is the spectrum of a pulse?
It is spread out across a wide band of 
frequencies.
Think about a lightning bolt.
So send a signal by emitting pulses.

        <slide>
          <slideno>7</slideno>
          <text>So assume we are sending bits
First question: what does a bit look like?
Lots of representations: low/high voltage, 
on/off light, high/low tone, N/S magnetic spin.
Picking the rep is part of the design.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>49</slideno>
          <text>How about fiber?
Wonderful signal to noise ratio.
Very little signal loss, compared to copper. 
So why try for spectral efficiency?
Typical modulation: light on/off.
Fiber is a cost-constrained design space.
High speed lasers are costly.
Long distance (high power) lasers are costly.
For more efficient use of fiber, use simple
frequency (color) division.
Dense wavelength division multiplexing DWDM
Only now beginning to see more complex 
modulation schemes.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>22</slideno>
          <text>Can we just get better?
Shannon gave us the theoretical limit, in terms of 
capacity C,bandwidth B, signal power S and 
noise N:
C/B = log2 (1+ S/N)
This is hard to derive but easy to think about.
Case 1: high signal to noise:
C/B = log2 (S/N) = 3.3log10 (S/N) = .33 dB S/N
So 30 dB channel -&gt; 10 b/s/Hz
40 dB channel -&gt; 13 b/s/Hz</text>

How to create multiple symbols?

frequency
phase
amplitude

        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>14</slideno>
          <text>So we have a clue to design
Wires can carry certain frequencies. This is 
the bandwidth of the wire.
Bandwidth B (measured in Hz) is not Capacity 
C (measured in bits/second).
Higher frequencies attenuate, and distance 
makes it worse.
Higher speed ethernet does not go as far.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>34</slideno>
          <text>History
This idea is older than Shannon.
Original idea was to hide the radio signal 
from enemy detection (assuming a 
narrow-band receiver).
WW2, patent by Hedy Lamarr and George 
Antheil, 6 years before Shannons result.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>31</slideno>
          <text>So where to decode?
Use DSL as example.
When data goes to the central office, what 
then?
Sample the DSL signal, digitize, encode and 
resend.
Decode the DSL to extract the bits, then send 
in some other format.
That is the Internet way--at each forwarding point, 
extract the packet, then recode for the new 
medium.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>Do we always send bits?
No. That is a recent idea.
Television, radio, etc are analog signals.
Amplitude modulation (AM) : the amplitude 
of the signal at any moment represents 
the amplitude of the data being sent.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>36</slideno>
          <text>Thinking about spread spectrum
The receiver can follow the signal if it knows 
the code. Otherwise, hard to find the 
signal in the noise.
CDMA--Code division multiple access.
There are other ways to spread the signal. 
If the signal is spread out enough, then on 
the average, S/N is less than 1.
The improvement from knowing the code is 
the processing gain, measured in dB.</text>

That log is a pain. 10x power means only +3 
improvement in b/s/Hz.
Much better to increase the bandwidth.
Double the bandwidth, same power, double 
the bits/second. (ignoring increase in noise.)
So go to the FCC and fight for spectrum.</text>

          <text>What is the EE problem?
Get some data across a link, or channel.
Not a network, just a link.
Could be a wire, a fiber, radio, or something.
The space of design--multi-dimensional 
optimization:
Bandwidth and distance
Cost
Power

          <text>Summary: EE rules of thumb
Coding:
Over a wire: 6 b/s/Hz is pretty good.
Over the air: 2 b/s/Hz is pretty good.
With bad noise: 1 b/s/Hz is not bad.
Sampling:
8 bits/sample x 2 samples/Hz = 16 b/s/Hz
So why digital?
Compression, clever sampling, etc.
Usually better in practice.</text>

          <text>Review--what is the point
Goal is to communicate
Over a channel of some sort.
With various requirements and constraints
Distance
Capacity
Cost
Efficiency: power, use of spectrum
Engineers spend lots of time devising 
solutions.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>48</slideno>
          <text>Designing better wire
Keep the signal inside when you want it 
inside.
Avoid loss (attenuation).
Have a high bandwidth.
Co-axial cable
A grounded sheath to keep the 
signal from leaking outTwister pair
Reduces radiation, inexpensive
Shielding makes it worse.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>13</slideno>
          <text>How could we improve this?
Go further, or send more bits, or something.
One option: improve the wire.
CAT 3, CAT 4, CAT 5, CAT 6, etc.
What are they doing?
Reducing loss.
Make the signal at the receiver bigger.
Reduce high-frequency attenuation.
Make the signal more well-defined.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>24</slideno>
          <text>What about radio?
All this applies.
Divide the spectrum up into frequency bands.
Think TV, FM, AM, etc.
Use some scheme like QAM in your band.
Current schemes come close to the 
Shannon limit.
But radio is noisy, so b/s/Hz tends to be 
worse than over a wire (Duh!)</text>

          <text>Spread spectrum
General idea:
Instead of squishing my signal into a narrow 
frequency band.
Intentionally spread it out across a wide 
band.
Two questions:
How?
Is it really a good idea?</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>47</slideno>
          <text>When is an antenna
not an antenna?
When it is a wire.
When we want the signal in the form of 
electromagnetic radiation, we call the wire an 
antenna.
When we dont want the radiation, we call it
Cross talk
Leakage
Interference.
In this respect, wires are not private.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>37</slideno>
          <text>Back to Shannon
C/B = log2 (1+ S/N)
Where total noise N = N0B 
If S/N &lt; 1, expansion of Log (1+S/N) S/N
So turn up the power?
But N is now the signal from the other senders.
This is not as efficient as frequency division.
Noise proportional to signal: dont turn up power
But N is not Gaussian white noise.
So Shannons limit does not apply.
That other noise is signal, so process it</text>

          <slideno>45</slideno>
          <text>Propagation
A final technical issue: what happens to radio 
signals as they radiate.
We looked at propagation along a wire: signals get 
weaker and lose the high frequencies.
Radio is like light (sort of).
Signal strength falls off as 1/d2(or worse)
Signals reflect
Signals interfere at the receiver (but not in free space)
Fade varies over time
Different frequencies behave differently.
Lower frequencies refract more.</text>

        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>32</slideno>
          <text>Different ways to share?
Dividing spectrum up into frequency bands 
is not the only option. 
Made lots of sense with simple, pre-digital 
radios.
Go back to Shannon. For given power, best 
C/B improvement is wider spectrum.
So perhaps we could all use the same 
spectrum and share in some other way?</text>

          <slideno>12</slideno>
          <text>Crude visualization
What goes in: What comes out:
After a while, cannot find the signal in the 
noise. So the representation interacts with 
distance to determine the region of utility.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>But we can convert
To digitize an analog waveform.
Find the highest frequency in the signal. 
Or filter to make it so.
Measure the amplitude at (at least) twice that 
frequency (the Nyquist rate).
Those two values are sufficient to recreate 
the waveform. 
Subject to the precision of the measurement.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>8</slideno>
          <text>Try a simple idea to send a bit
Take a wire.
Send DC voltage for 1, no voltage for 0.
Reconsider: means sending average of 1/2 
voltage, so net current flows.
Send + DC voltage for 1, - DC voltage for 0.
Simple, low cost, does not go very far, 
works.

        <slide>
          <slideno>11</slideno>
          <text>Lets talk about distance
First digression into EE:
What happens to a signal as it goes down a 
wire? 
It gets weaker.
Crisp transitions get vague.
High-frequency attenuation.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>15</slideno>
          <text>Another idea--better representation
A short history of dialup modem design:
The channel has a bandwidth of about 4 kHz.
So signal must have a frequency profile that 
fits inside that envelope.
How to do this?
Instead of two voltages, send:
Two frequencies? FSK -&gt; 110 b/s in 1960s
One frequency but shift the phase?  PSK
Why just two? Aha!</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>17</slideno>
          <text>An example: QAM
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation.
Quadrature describes a way to talk about 
variation in the phase.
With respect to a reference, a signal can be 
in phase orin quadrature which is 90 
degrees off.</text>

New way--digital
Keep the 6 mHz allocation
Cable: use 256 QAM, get about 6 b/s/Hz,
or36 mb/sec

          <text>What are we sending?
Computer systems represent data as bits, 
so we send bits.
Other systems send analog signals, or 
digitized analog systems (bits, usually).
So no single answer.
A brief digression into sampling.</text>

          <slideno>28</slideno>
          <text>Why is the phone so limited?
Where did that 4 kHz limit come from?
The wire?
Nope. The wire can do better than that?
The switches?
Not the old ones. Relays have great bandwidth.
It is the digital backbone.
The insides of the phone system are all digital.
Nyquist sampling requires that you filter before you 
sample.</text>

          <text>State of the art
TDMA cellular, 48 kb/s over 30 kHz channel, 
or 1.6 b/s/Hz.
Power limited (cell phone battery).
Spectrum limited (want to carry lots of calls at 
same time).
Noise limited.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>44</slideno>
          <text>Why is this relevant to the class?
A wire is a private affair (usually).
Spectrum is more public.
Most countries, as matter of policy, regulate its use. 
In US, FCC and NTIA.
Regulation centers on who can use, and how to 
divide it up. 
In other words, how to share.
So regulation constrains the technical options.
By tradition, allocate frequencies. See NTIA chart.
But this is not the only way, as we have learned.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>38</slideno>
          <text>So why do spread spectrum?
Difficulty of interception and detection.
Soft sharing.
Instead of rigid frequency bands, more or 
fewer shares depending on current 
conditions.
Easier to exploit the power of digital signal 
processing.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>29</slideno>
          <text>Things can get complex
Think about computer communication over 
the phone system.
Encode the digital stream into a 4 kHz limited 
analog signal.
Send that to central office, where
It is digitized as 64 kb/s bit stream,
Which is then encoded and send over high-
speed circuits.</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>21</slideno>
          <text>A figure of merit:
A circuit has bandwidth B, measured in Hz.
We devise a scheme with some capacity C, 
measured in bits/second.
Express the efficiency as C/B, or 
bits/second/Hz (b/s/Hz)
Original modem 110 b/s 4 KHz, .0275 b/s/Hz
Current modem 56 kb/s, 14b/s/Hz  (this is 
impossible in general, and requires magic)
Factor of 509 improvement</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>46</slideno>
          <text>Antenna design
Use multiple antennas to deal with interference 
(curing deep fade)
Use multiple antennas to create multiple paths.
This seems like magic.
As frequencies go up, antennas get smaller.
But receive less power.
This is a golden age for electrical engineering.
Higher frequencies, digital processing, cheap silicon, 
better theory.
Creates lot of tension for regulators.</text>

Music: The Legal Context
First Distinction
A Song
A Sound Recording
Second Distinction
Reproduction Right
Making Copies
Public Performance Right
Owned By the Song Owner
Not Owned By the Recording Owner
Changed in 1995 to add digital audio transmission
Compulsory License (Section 115)
If a recording has been distributed, the owner of a song must license the
use of the song at a legislated rate

Conclusions?
Of Course, the Shape of the Distribution Can Change a Lot
But, What Does the Base Analysis Suggest?
Are the Companies That Unfair?
Or, Is There Something Else?

Ice-Ts Take on
Napster, the Law and Morality (2000 Aug 7)
The recording companies, are tripping off the fact this
stuff comes through the computer clean, he said.
Thats the thing. When it comes on the radio, you
can tape it, I can send it to my homeboy. But mail
moves slow and the Internet moves faster.
[]Why do so many people traffic in music they
havent paid for? To me, Ice-T said, you got the
cops and the robbers. And, to me, I think human
beings are naturally robbers. I think human beings
want it free. And that's just your nature. And, if there
is a way around paying, that is what you are going to
do. None of you guys are moral enough to say I would
rather pay $16 than get it free.

Can be minor, major or dominant element
Opportunities in implementation
But, important limitations
Flexibility/Ease of refinement
Discretion?
Transparency  recognition  it s happening

Increasingly requires formal appreciation of the technology
itself before the scope of architectures influence on the

Controversial Monopoly Grant - T.Jefferson
If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an
idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps
it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself
of it.
Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because
every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from
me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who
lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.
... The exclusive right to invention [is] given not of natural right, but
for the benefit of society

A Key Insight: Technological Alienation
Unlike other domains for distribution, digitized
distribution forces content consumers to rely upon
complex, technological artifacts
Contrast with books, sheet music
Reading ability is internal to consumers
With digitized content, consumers are alienated
from the ability to read content as delivered
Also true for analog music, video, etc.

Little evidence so far that forcing open

          <text>Network neutrality
Do we know what it means?
No
Can we fight over it anyway?
Yes
It might mean:
Blocking some content.
Discriminatory use of QoS.
Charging some providers.

Bad future 1a: Vertical reintegration restricted 
innovation etc. 
Bad future 2: open access commoditization of

          <text>Death of distance--not
Distance did not die. It is not even badly 
injured. It is only sleeping.
For some content (such as IPTV) current 
costs do not permit large-scale wide area 
transport.
Content will have to be staged locally.
Then costs go to zero.

          <text>Some rough estimates
Of that $40/month, $2 might be for usage.
Heavy users may generate 10x the traffic of 
average users.
So a heavy user may cost an ISP ~ 
$20/month. Solution: block heavy users!
These usage costs are for wide area traffic.
This behavior is a barrier to some
innovation.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>23</slideno>
          <text>Review: our goal should be
Encourage an industry structure in which:
There is adequate continuing investment in 
infrastructure.
There is sufficient openness to encourage 
innovation.
Users have adequate choice and there is 
competitive discipline.
ISPs are a part of the system, not a external 
supplier.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>5</slideno>
          <text>Look at reality today

Are there barriers to investment, and what 
does openness have to do with it?
How is the landscape shifting, and can we 
move to a better outcome?</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>20</slideno>
          <text>Questions (?) for the future
Will we worry about vertical integration 
between ISPs and overlay services?
Will we worry about the openness of 
overlays?
Will we worry if Akamai gains monopoly 
status?
Will we worry if Google or Microsoft buys 
Akamai?
Should we worry about Google?</text>

          <slideno>8</slideno>
          <text>Digression--making money
Specific focus on consumer broadband.
Today: fixed pricing. $40/month (or so) 
independent of usage.
This creates cost pressures and perverse 
incentives.
New applications higher usage higher 
cost, but constant revenues, so lower 
profits. Why would an ISP love a new 
app?</text>

          <slideno>22</slideno>
          <text>Who can help the ISPs?
Open research.
Academia and neutral funding creates a 
special opportunity.

Cisco.
To Cisco, ISP is a customer.
To most, ISP is an enemy.
And why should Cisco care? Akamai and 
Google do not buy from Cisco</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>Open: what does that mean?
Open is code for several things.
Open to third party innovation.
Open to user choice and the discipline of competition.
Open to equal access to content.
There are theories that one sort of openness will 
protect another.
Open is also code for weak incentive to invest
(in some circles).
Again, lots of theory (and posturing) here.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>16</slideno>
          <text>More general point--overlays
Akamai is an example of an overlay network.
Collection of servers provided in organized way to 
support applications.
Lots of other examples: routing, security.
Overlays change the layering model of the 
Internet.
What goes where; who does what.
The layering model becomes more fluid.
Overlays challenge our understanding of industry 
structure and regulation.
We tend to associate layers with industry sectors.
We tend to associate policy with layers and sectors.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>7</slideno>
          <text>Some thoughts
There is good blocking, and bad
blocking.
We could disagree on the criteria for bad.
Most ISPs are not monopolists. So:
A duopoly is not good enough.
There is not enough consumer concern to 
discipline these classes of activity.
Why pick AOL?
Lots of economic theory here.</text>

          <slideno>12</slideno>
          <text>How might that happen?
Sell enhanced network-level services such as 
enhanced QoS.
Is this better than vertical integration with apps?
Find a new pricing model for packet carriage.
Usage tiers? Weekend splurge pricing? 
Sell applications that are naturally local.
Backup
Sell application-support services.

          <text>ISPs certainly block things
Block applications that are security risks.
Block servers in the home .
For capacity reasons
To stratify market.
Block modes of certain applications.
What server can you use to send email?
Again, is this security or stratification?
They (try to) block to protect revenues in 
applications.
They block traffic to control costs.</text>

          <slideno>17</slideno>
          <text>Other possible questions:

Each of these is a revenue opportunity that 
the ISPs missed. Important to understand 
why.
Who can lend them a hand?</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>15</slideno>
          <text>Good or bad?
Bad: ISPs could not exploit opportunity, left 
revenues on table.
Dive to commodity packet carriage.
Good: Akamai moves money across the 
Internet.
Jumps peering points (revenue neutral 
boundaries).
ISPs get (or save) money, without having to 
solve coordination problems.</text>

Scarce Abundant
Both consistent with ma rkets, both still regulated
yUnlicensed protocol can be chosen by SDO or markets
yEnforcement via courts of li cense prope rty rights is regulation by another 
means
No free lunch, but spectrum reform lowers opportunity cost
yTransition, congestion, tran saction costs must be borne
yAuctions may be used to effect tr ansition, but not to extract rents
Scarcity we observe is mostly artificial
yNot driven by need to avoid interference

Spectrum Management Models
Three basic models:
yCommand &amp; Control: (legacy model under attack)
Technology, provider, services specified by regul ator
yExclusive license: Property rights
Flexible, transferable licen ses to operate in area/band.
Licensee chooses technology, services
Secondary markets: li censee can trade rights to third parties
yUnlicensed: Commons
Underlay: UWB, Part 15 devices (secondary use)
Opportunistic: interleaving, use white space (secondary use)
Dedicated: IS M 2.4 and 5 GHz bands used by WiF i
Policy recommendation: increased reliance on exclusive licensed 
for scarce spectrum or commons otherwise
yEspecially for spectrum below 3GHz</text>

Lehr, 2006
Why spectrum reform now?
Lots of new technology and services that are being held back by 
legacy regulations
yInsufficient spectrum for commercial use
yWhat is available, is not used efficiently
yLicense rules limit market flexibility
Problem: Artificial spectrum scarcity!
ySharing opportunities missed
yInnovation blockaded: services, devices, and business models
yHigh marginal cost for spectrum (auctions bankrupt providers)
Solution: Spectrum Reform</text>

Auctions vs. Free UseCommon themes, false dichomomy
Ifscarcity, need to allocate and opportunit y cost i s borne. How 
financed/paid for is separabl e matter.
Auctions achi eve effi cient assignment 
yNot necessaril y if (1) market power; (2) capital market 
inefficiencies; (3) irreversible in vestments &amp; uncertainty (lock-i n).
yOnly for first assignment (also ne ed efficient secondary markets)
Could use fee mechanism to charge for access. Could have admission 
control for access to congested commons.
If spectrum revenue collect ed, who gets it? 
yGeneral fund or keep in sector (e.g., auctions as general tax 
mechanism)? Is a spectrum tax efficient?</text>

Licensed v. Unlicensed (simplistic view)
Markets Government
Auctions Free
Scarce Abundant
Spectrum scarce: use mar kets =&gt; exclusive licenses
yEliminate command &amp; control. Transition to mark et forces. Allocate initially with auctions.
yDefine property rights that may be fl exibly tra ded in secondary markets
Spectrum abundant: cons erve tr ansaction costs =&gt; unlicensed
yNo need to incur overhead of pr operty rights regime to allocate
yProvide open access.
Coordination costs 
ySmall are a (low power) (e.g., within home) =&gt; coordination costs without centralized 
enforcement are low =&gt; unlicensed f ine
yLarge area (high power) (e.g., metro mobile) =&gt; coordination costs high, spectrum and 
network are co-specialized =&gt; use licensed
Conclusion: (1) Flexible licensed for scarce (low-frequency) spectrum; and (2) 
Unlicensed access via secondary use (underlays, overlays)</text>

Spectrum scarcity?Real differences that may be important..
What can technology do? 
ySmart receivers, MUD, etc. increase capacity
yNeed to maintain innovation and adoption incentives.
No scarcity, then no need  for property rights 
yReturn to pre-1912 world for RF. 
Even if scarcit y, commons may be more efficient
yOpen access/unlicensed instead of frequency-area licenses
But, can we be certain?
yHow to protect sunk investment? (What is value of capital equipment?)
yCannot have free resource that is substitute for other costly resources (computation v. 
transport v. storage)
yIs commons more easily reversible? (Interest group politics v. Takings)

(Capabilities)Smart radio systems, spread spectrum, transition to 
broadband platform architectures 
frequency agility, expanded capacity for sharing
Revenue
(Customer experience)Heterogeneous networks (3G/WiFi, wireless/wired, global 
roaming) 24/7 availability, simplicity of use, seemles s
mobility
Costs
(Network provisioning)Bursty traffic, multimedia services, fat-tailed usage profiles

Spectrum Management and Wireless Markets
Broadcasting Spectrum (excl usive, inflex ible licenses)  example of problem
yArchitecture for high power transmission for ov er-the-air broadcasters uses (low power) 
spectrum inefficiently
yMove terrestrial TV  to satellites or wires (cable)
yEncourage development of  smart receivers
yLegacy of using interference threat to op pose com petition (FM radio, U HF broadcasting) 
and slow to deploy new tech nology (digital T V conversion)
yWhat about over-the-air digital TV?
Mobile Telephone Services (exclusive , (semi)-flexible licenses)  success!
yPoster child for competition success : consumer  choice, declining prices, service innovation.
yUse spectrum very efficiently. Lots of sharing.
yAllocated via auctions (but what about 3G  auctions and telecom meltdown in 2000?)
yBenefits of mandating a single standard? 2G in E urope v. US
yFurther growth constrained by lack of access  to available spectrum
WiFi success (open access, unlicensed)  success!
yPower limits on equipment. No exclus ive right to interference protection.
yCongestion emerging as problem.

          <text>The two modes
Transit: small ISP pays large ISP to deliver 
packets to/from anywhere.
Peering: two ISP agree to exchange packets 
for free.
Normally, only packets destined for each ISP 
and its transit customers.
Normally, no payment.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>9</slideno>
          <text>What is wrong? 
Peering points are sometimes congested.
Hard to negotiate about upgrade.
ISPs cannot offered assured end to end 
service.
Small players distort themselves to balance 
packet flow.
Perhaps there is a real inefficiency.
Value is not symmetric.
Revenue neutrality is easy, but unjustified.</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>6</slideno>
          <text>Dig deeper--why?
Internet has no expression of value flow.
No 800 numbers. 
Packet flow not the same as value flow.
(No concept of a call.)
We were proud of that.
So, two rough arguments.
1)You were going to get the traffic anyway.
2)Some sort of symmetry.</text>

Courts and Antitrust Enforcement
US: Department of Justice v. F CC; Euro pe: DG C ompetition v. DG Information Society
Antitrust: prevent abuse of monopoly power
yBlock mergers that create market power
yPenalize behavior that abus es (p redatory pric ing, illegal tying)
yMarket power not illegal per se , only its misuse.
Measuring market power is contentious
yDefine markets
Horizontal markets: are goods substitutes?
Vertical markets: co mplements ? Essential?
yAbility to sustain price above cost for significant time
Potential ent ry can constrain (ent ry barriers?)
Predatory pricing/illegal tying or Efficient pricing? Ambiguous economics.
yPricing below cost, but what is cost? 
Hard to measure wh en sh ared/co mmon costs, rapid technical progress
Dynam ic pricing with externalities, learning
yComplementary bundling of products or illegal tying 
e.g., Microsoft browser and OS
Antitrust regulation is ex post
yPresumption that industry competitive

Rate of Return Regulation (RoR)
Regulatory Compact
yCarrier agrees to provide: Universal service 
Carrier of Last Resort, Duty to Serve
yRegulator agrees to allow: Cost recovery (+ fair return)
Prices = costs + allowed return = c+F/q + rK/q
Rate base (K), fair return (r) which risk-adjusted, depreciation
Retail rate regulation
yPrices set to achieve social goals
Low for consumers (US), high for carriers/equipment makers (Japan)
Recover costs and support employment or generate govt. revenues
yPrices include implicit subsidies: 
Toll-&gt;Local, Urban-&gt;Rural, Bus-&gt;Res, Usage-&gt;Fixed
Entry restrictions (protection from competition)
yTelecom out of computers, everyone else out of telecom

Transition to Competition
Market s instead of Sovie t-style central planning!
yRegulatory capture/rent-seeki ng and overhead costs avoided
yCompetition =&gt; Survival of the Fittest =&gt; Efficiency
yPrices driven to cost  (no excess profits)
Privati zation of PTTs and creation of NRAs (1980/1990s)
Liberal ization and Deregulation:
yEquipment markets  1960/ 1970s
yInternational/ Long distance (US)  1980s
yMobile services (and auctions)  1990s
yLocal (Loop unbundling)  1990s
From Ro Rto Price Cap: P(t+1) = P(t)  Productivity Adj.
yIf transition to competition, then  eventually markets set prices
yIf no transition, then Ro Rwith a regulatory lag.
Rules for Interconnection and Access
yWith competition, there wi ll be multiple networks
yEntrants need access to legacy  network (at least initially)

1. Consumers are entitled to access the la wful Internet content of their choice;
2. Consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their  choice, 
subject to the n eeds of law  enforcement;
3. Consumers are entitled to  connect their  choice of legal devices that do not 
harm the network ; and
4. Consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, 
applicat ion and service provid ers, and content providers .The Federal Communications Commission today adopted a policy statement that 
outlines four  principles to encour age broadband deployment and  preserve and 
promote the open and interconnected nature of public Internet:
Although the Commission did not adopt r ules in this regard, it will incorporate these 
principles into its ongoing policymaking activities. All of  these prin ciples are

Farrell &amp; Weisers Exceptions (Holes in the ICE), part 1
Baxters Law 
Regulated monopolist, cant recove r added value in platform prices
Consider: Western Electric equ ipment prices pre-divestiture
Price Discrimination 
Platform monopolist may impose highly ineffici ent restricti ons on applications competition in 
order to engage in price discrimination [in the applications market]
For example, in the Interne t environment, customer identity  might be more readily tracked 
through the complement than through the platform product
Potential Competition
Complements evolve to threaten the platform, vi a substitution or entry
Consider: cables restrictions  on streaming video; VoIP rev enue cannibalization for telcos
Bargaining Problems
Monopolist may not be cred ible partner if also in complementary markets
Consider: cases of voluntary st ructural separation (Palm; Intel)</text>

Discussion: Economics of Discrimination
Other exceptions to ICE?
Appropriability issue
Farrell &amp; Weiser, Footno te 74: Suggests that  monopolist may not always be able to 
appropriate (internalize) all the value that unfettered complementors might create
van Schewicks analysis
Can broadband access provi der charge consumer s more based on:
Value of personal informatio n collected by independent appl ication/service providers?
Value of Google s advertising?
What if the platform  is not a monopoly?
Maximizing overall consumer va lue (size of the pie)  may now confl ict with m aximizing size 
of individual firms portion
OTOH, does it become  harder to get away with discrimination?
Other considerations from inform ation economics, firm strategy
Issues with applying the ICE model
Policy value of economic model burdened with complex set of qualifications and exceptions?
Is the network operator the only relevant platform?
Ultimately, is discrimination  the concern, or market power?</text>

          <text>Gillett 2006 12Policy Responses (FCC): Michael Powells Four Freedoms
Freedom to  Access Content. First, 
consumers should have access to their  
choice of legal content.
I challe nge all facets of the in dustry to 
commit to all owing cons umers to reach the 
content of thei r choice. I recogn ize that 
netw ork operators hav e a legitima te need to 
manage their netw orks and en sure a qualit y 
expe rience, thus rea sonable li mits 
sometimes must be placed i n service 
contracts. Such restraints, h owever, sho uld 
be clearly spelled out a nd should be  as 
minimal as n ecessar y.
Freedom to  Use Applications. 
Second, consumers should be able to 
run applications of their  choice.
No one can know for sure which killer
applications will emerge to  drive depl oyment of 
the next generati on hi gh-speed technologi es. 
Thus, I challe nge all facets of the i ndustry to l et 
the market work and al low c onsum ers to run 
applications unless they  exceed service pla n 
limitations or harm t he providers net work.Freedom to  Attach Personal Devices. 
Third, c onsumers should be per mitted to 
attach any devices t hey choose to the 
connection in their homes.
I chall enge all facets of the in dustry to p ermit 
consumers to attach any devices they choose to 
their broadband connection, so long as the 
devices operate w ithin service plan limitations 
and do not harm the provi ders netw ork or 
enable theft of service.
Freedom to Obtain Service Plan 
Information .Fourth, consumers should 
receive meaningful infor mation r egarding 
their service plans.
Providers have every righ t to o ffer a var iety of 
service tiers with varyi ng bandw idth and feature 
options.  C onsumers need  to know a bout thes e 
choices as well as whethe r and how the ir service 
plans protect them against spam, spyware and 
other potential invasions of privacy.  Thus, I 
challenge all facets of th e industry to ensure that 
broadband consumers ca n easily obtain the 
information they n eed to mak e ration al choices 
among an ever-expanding ar ray of different prici ng 
and service plans.From Pow ell Speech , PRESERVING INT ERNET FREEDOM:

Economic Incentives for Network Operators:
Farrell &amp; Weiser Paper
Model
Platforms vs. Complement s (upstream or downstream)
Platform (i.e. network operator) is monopolist
Theory: Internalizing Complementary Efficiencies (ICE)
Economic theory
Law of one monopoly pro fitor no double margi nalization (Cournot, 1838)
Economides &amp; Lehr explain: An integrated monopolist produc ing both A and B will charge 
less than two vertically-related monopo lists, each produci ng one component only.
Intuition
If there are positive external ities from encouraging comple ments, monopolist will do so 
and internalize the benefits
Complements create more  consum er val ue, make platform worth more
Monopolist appropriates thes e benefits by c harging more for the platform
So, monopolist doesnt have  incentive to discourage compleme ntary innovation s, even if 
vertically integrated

Ciscos Version of the Four Freedoms
Broadband Inter net access consumers  should have access to their choice of legal 
Internet content within the bandwidth limits and qualit y of service of  their 
service plan. 
Broadband Inter net access consumers  should be able to run applications of their  
choice, within the bandwidth limit s and qualit y of service of  their service plans, 
as long as they do not harm the provider's ne twork. 
Consumers should be per mitted to atta ch any devices they choose to their  
broadband Inter net access connection at the consumer's  premises, so long as 
they operate within the bandwidth limits  and quality of  service of  their  service 
plans and do not harm the provider's ne twork or  enable thef t of services. 
Consumers should receive meaningful info rmation regarding their  broadband Inter net 
access service plans.
And in addition, Cisco supports  Network Management principles:
Broadband Internet access serv ice providers should remain free to enga ge in pro-competitive 
network management techni ques to alleviate congestion, am eliorate capacity constraints, and 
enable new services. 
Broadband Internet access service providers should remain free to offer additional services to 
supplement broadband Internet access, including bandw idth tiers, quality of service, security, 
anti-virus and anti-spam servic es, network management services , as well as to enter into 
commercially negotiated agreements with unaffiliated partie s for the provision of such 
additional services.</text>

Farrell &amp; Weisers Exceptions, part 2
Incompetent Incumbents
Firms may fail to apprecia te (counter-intu itive) IC E, value of modularity
Especially when emerging from fully integrated regulated system
Option Value
Once firm pursues open/ modular strategy, regulators may not let it change cour se even if full 
integration later pro ves more efficient
Regulatory Strategy Considerations
Openness in one do main may force openness in others (consider cable TV)
Incomplete Complementarity
If applications (complemen ts) have value without the platform  (or on other pl atforms), then 
platform  provi der can gain by monopolizing complements 
Intuition: cant capture full value from  these appl ications via the platform</text>

What is Network Neutrality? (Wu)
Ideal: shorthand for a system of belief about innovation policy
Implementation: Regulate behavior rather than structure
Precedent: Computer Inquiries
Earlier: li ne of busi ness restrictions; Later: ONA/ CEI
Objectionable behavior = unjustified discrimination
Assumes a way to disti nguish l egitim atefrom unjustified (i.e. harmful) discrimination
Wus proposal
Implicitly based on layers model
OK to discriminate within a network (Laye r 3 and below)
Not OK to discriminate across ne tworks (above in ternetwork layer)

Other Industry Responses
Ed Whitacre, SBC, fall 2005 (Business Week Interview)
Q: How concerned are yo u about Internet upst arts like Google, MSN,  Vonage, and others?
A: How do you think theyre go ing to get to cust omers? Through a broadband pipe. Cable 
companies  have them. We have them. Now what they would like to do is use my pipes free, but I 
aintgoing to l et them do that because we have spent th is capital and we ha ve to have a return 
on it. So theres going to have to be some me chanism for these people who use these pipes to 
pay for the porti on they re using. Why should they be allowed to use m y pipes?
The In ternet can t be free in  that sense, b ecau se we and the cab le compan ies h avemade 
an investment and fo r a Google or Yahoo or V onage or any body  to expect to use these 
pipes [fo r] free is nu ts!
Google (Cerf testimony), February 7, 2006
A number of justificat ions have been created to  support carrier control over consumer choices 
online; none stand up  to scrutiny. Open-ended carrier discrimination is not needed to protect 
users from viruses, stop spam, preserve network integrity, make  VOIP or vi deo servi ce work 
properly  or even insure that carriers are compen sated for their broadband investments. In 
particular, we firml y believe that carrier s will be able to set ma rket prices for Internet 
access and be well-paid for their investments as broadband carriers in  other countries have 
successfully done.
The broadband carriers  already are fully compen sated by their resident ial customers for their 
use of the network. These com panies can charge their own customers whatev er they want, in 
order to make back their invest ments. Trying to extract additional fe es from Web-based 
companies  who are not in any way customers of the provider -- would consti tute a form of 
double recovery. Google takes no issue with  the broadband carriers ability  to set prices 
for Internet access that compensate  for the costs and risks ass ociated with their network 
investments.</text>

          <text>ESD. 68 Lecture Notes 
4 and 6 April 2006 (Lehr)  
Lecture : Challenges for Convergence: Interconnection 
Overview of the policy challenges introduced by convergence from voice and videos 
vertical silos to converged digital networks patterned after th e Internets horizontally 
layered architecture. Case study of carrier interconnection as a convergence policy issue, 
with focus on the need for interconnection policies among network service providers 
(backbone Internet providers, wireless and wireline ne tworks, ISPs and ILECs, etc.) and 
alternative models for regulating interconnection. Debate will focus on whether there is a need to adopt a universal (converged) interconnection regime and the rationale for bill and keep. 
Assigned Readings for this Lecture Include: 
Sicker, Douglas (2002), "Further Defining a Layered Model for Telecommunications Policy," draft mimeo, October 2002. 
DeGraba, Patrick, Bill and Keep at the Central Office As the Efficient Interconnection 
Regime, OPP Working Paper Series N o. 33, Federal Communications Commission, 
December 2000. 
Kende, Michael The Digital Handshake: Connecting Internet Backbones, OPP 
Working Paper Series No. 32, Federal Communications Commission, 2000. 
Some questions to consider include: 
	How does "conve rgence" challenge policymakers? What are the implications for 
traditional broadcast, telecom, and cable regulation? 
	Why is it important to adopt a unified intercarrier compensation scheme? What are the challenges to doing this? What are the benefits (costs ) of doing (failing to do) 
this? 
	Do you think Bill and Keep is the right approach for regulating intercarrier 
compensation?

"Evil" and "scumware" were among the tags
attached to the country duo Johnny and Donnie
Van Zant's "Get Right with the Man" - the
first album identified by the blogosphere as
containing Sony BMG's doomed D.R.M. software.
And "rootkit" is now a tag attached to many
Sony BMG titles.
"Do not buy" is another.
Among the customer "reviews" posted under the
Van Zant album last week was this
observation: "Regardless of the legendary
family name or anything the group does from
here on out, they will forever be remembered
for releasing this album.
"It's kind of unfair to us," Johnny Van Zant
said of the whole affair,
