          <text> de-essentializing sex/gender/ kinship; querying motherhood 
 
moving to final topic: from th inking about sexuality  as de sire, behavior, identity, and 
various constellations of the 3  to re productive politics  no t unrelated stories 
 helpful transition is to recall the history we traced (Katz) of contrasting sexual ethics: 
 procreative ethic of sex   sex is productive of babi es, producing babies is good, 
therefore  in this way  sex is good  pleasure ethic of sex    sex is pleasurable, can be t hought of and valued apart from 
procreation  the pendulum swings of sexual ethics (agr arianism to capitalism; post WWII baby boom 
to Playboy &amp; 60s sexual liberation)  has been matter of emphasis , not absolute 
difference  not mutually exclusive; both available for rhet orical appeal  certainly 
today:  pleasure ethic today bolstered by increasing vi sibility of homosexual lifestyles  straight 
people dont want to miss out on pleasure part  but increasing abstinence-only sex ed 
new voice for procreative ethic (more in couple weeks)  sex can  be procreative; sex can be pleasurable  its often neither 
what were talking about are reigning ideologies  of what sex is and should be , how 
people expect to experience  it, and why we should value  it  its significance as a 
component of human nature  
missing from this distinction (Katz) is how these comp eting ethics have been 
differentiated by  and used to differen tiate --  not only along an axis of sexuality  (while 
many heterosexuals were committed to procreative ethic, homosexuals carved out 
alternative identity based on a different attitude toward sex, pleasure ethic) but also of 
gender   among heterosexuals (once we get that  category), procrea tive ethic has been 
applied more consistently to women  than to men  womens natural sexual desire said 
to be aimed at procreation mo re consistently than mens 
 these sexual ideologies have flip-flopped  frequently enough in recent history  even 
your lifetimes  not difficult to realize that sexuality  how people experience 
themselves and others as sexual beings  is historically and culturally produced, shaped  
 however
, it may be more difficult to view motherhood  in the same way  as 
ideologically produced, socially constructed  but its true  sexuality, motherhood, marriage, The Family (cap ital letters)  these are all pieces of the 
same puzzle  elements that some have de picted as the founda tion of society or, 
alternatively, as the foundati on of civilization  a particul ar, exhaulted, type of society

problem of functionalist  thinking: because a social institution is observed to  
perform a necessary function does not mean either that the function would not be 
performed if the institution did not exist or  that the function is responsible for the 
existence of the institution (73)  just because we can descri be it, see it, doesnt m ean thats whats going on 
 SO, instead of asking, is The Family a human universal? Need to ask: What do we mean 
by family? (is there A Family?) 
 Instead of assuming all mothers are by defin ition, or by nature, nurturing and loving, we 
have to ask: What does nurturance look lik e? Does it look differe nt under different 
circumstances? What is mother love? What makes a mother?  Instead of assuming all children better off with biological mothers, or that they need both a father and a mother, we  need to ask: What do we mean by real mothers? What 
distinguishes fathering and moth ering? Is what makes a good  father similar to good 
mothering, or different? Are both equally nurt uring? If a woman who isnt biologically 
related to a child can mother, can a man mother?    remaining readings for today are about 3 qui te different ethnographi c cases that raise 
similar questions, engage similar issues   questioning assumptions about real 
motherhood and real families  
1) selective maternal neglect  of poor women in Brazilian shanty towns (Nancy Scheper-
Hughes) 
2) mothers of children with disabilities in upstate NY, struggling with status as real 
mothers (Gail Landsman) 3) transracial and international adoption (Christine Ward Gailey) 
 each of these cases calls in to question common assumptions among Americans about the 
meaning and experience of motherhood  as definition and lived reality 
 have to understand this in context of wider meanings of personhood, love, agency, 
marriage, family  divide you into 3 GROUPS to collectively analyze  these case studies  
  what assumptions that you held (or see as  commonly held) were revealed to be  
assumptions? overgeneralizations? 
 how do gender, sex (action), sexuality (identity ) come together in this case  or not? 
 what do we learn about families, mothering, nurturing  what these are/arent? how  
might case study push us to rethink general understandings about what makes a real family or counts as real mother ing?  implications for current debates?

          <text>But as Collier, Rosaldo and Yanagisako  point out, most of our talk about families is 
clouded by unexplored notions of wh at families really are like. 
 
Confusing ideal with reality, we fail to appreciate th e deep significance of what 
are, cross-culturally, various ideologies of intimate relationship, and at the same 
time we fail to reckon with the complex human bonds and experiences all too comfortably sheltered by a faith in the n atural source of a n urture we think is 
found in the home. (first page)  in other words, when we hear about families, we often stop thinking! 
 Why?   C, R,Y suggest that b/c family has been on private side of public/pri vate division (itself 
illusion, but with real effects for how people ac t)  as a society weve failed to grapple 
with the complexity of what goes on in the name of the family, in the name of love 
 not merely a matter of law, but of culture   we dont want to  see legal officials 
make random checks of domestic settings (which of course they do when families are receiving state support)  arent a lot of checks on what happens in families  Adrienne Rich wrote in her article on compulsory heterosexuality: to believe 
that intimacy is part of what a family/marriage is has also meant we often limit our search for intimacy to the family  can be an inhospitable place in patriarchal 
societies (law of fathers)  for women and children  
 
of course family can also be inhospitable place for gender/sexuality non-
conformists  boys who like to dress up, girl s who refuse to s it still or who are 
overweight, etc., coming out to parents of ten most difficult hurdle  stakes are 
high  [then again, our belief in the sanctity of the home as space of privacy has also 
served  eventually  as a basis for legitimating homosexuality  anti-sodomy laws struck down as unconstitutional, infringement on privacy]  In any event, 
 we need to closely examine what we mean by these terms  not just sexuality, but family, marriage, motherhood, fatherhood  not  take their meanings for granted  
recognize they are not transhisto rical things, but pr oducts of particular  social, political, 
economic histories  and therefore subject to ongoing cultural &amp; legal interpretation 
 To see them otherwise, to see them as universal and fixed (as early  anthropologists did), 
is to miss the specificity and maleability of our own definitions and understandings

          <text>from article: Bronislaw Malinowski, consider ed a father of British social anthropology, 
did ethnographic research in the Trobriand Islands in the south Pacific during WWI 
 Malinowski argued in 1920s that yes, fa mily = human universal, he was arguing against  
19th C social evolutionists with their progre ss narrative of human cultural evolution  
(Europeans at apex; for them, the family not n atural but as cornerst one of civilization 
 evidence of western moral superiority)   Malinowsis cultural relativism  was well-intentioned 
 BUT undermined by fact that his argument rested on ethnocentric  assumptions: that 
family = nurturnance 
basically, he argued that since we need nur turance, and families = nurturance, thus we 
have families  its a functional  definition  
 functionalism theoretical framework characteri stic of early British social anthropology 
 for Malinowski: basic human needs:    are met through social institutions  n u r t u r a n c e      f a m i l y   procreation     kinship system  sustenance     subsistence tech, division of labor  shelter      housing design  organization     law, political systems  difference = cultural variati on in ways humans meet basic needs (hunting/foraging v.  
agriculture? patrilineage v. matrilineage?) 
similar to how gender in 70s was seen as cult ural variation of biological sex difference   
cultural elaboration of ge nder difference was a social need more or less 
functioned same way everywhere 
 for Malinowski,  family mapped onto:  1) distinct and bounded group distin guishable from other such groups 
 2) group located in physical space  hearth and home  3) shared affective bonds, pa rticular set of emotions 
 family = conflation of genealogy /household/emotional intimacy 
Collier et al. point out that this is in formed by Victorian public/private division 
 
its ethnocentric to claim theyre just like us when ar gument based on reading our 
institutions and values onto their practices 
 
similarly, as weve seen, sex/gender system its elf to some extent ethnocentric: implies 2-
sex model of binary gender difference   
(other cultures recognize other possib ilities  perhaps 3rd sex/gender, perhaps 
blending of binaries)

 social production of indifference   mothers reactions to infant mo rtality not autonomously authored 
  tempered by indifference of State (barely registers these deaths, or lives)   and Church (which once celebrated child death and now wants to deny it

 Gailey (white mother of a black child who had been abused by foster parents) 
adoption is the result of two violations of natu ral motherhood [in US]: 
procreation without marriage and nonprocre ation within marriage. So the U.S. 
adoption triad has two failed mothers and a rejected or substitute child as the

 not that it isnt real  have real effect, creates real muscles, etc.  indeed, Hubbard wants us to attend to the material effects of cultural ideas of gender   but biology is not destiny (contra Freud, who said anatomy is destiny) 
 biology and society, nature and culture continuously reshape one another 
 
think about how womens bodies have changed through time, varied according to 
other social categories  
a lot of work goes into producing gendered bodies  effort to tame unruly secondary sex 
characteristics  plucking, shaving, dying hair; voice training   we need have no ideological investment in whether women and men exhibit biological differences, aside from the obvious ones i nvolved with procreation. .. we cannot know 
whether such biological differences exist b ecause biology and society (or environment) 
are interdependent and cannot be sorted out (128).   Q: what did you think of her arguments? about mens and womens relative strength, height differences  search for natural limits?  socially sanctioned childhood activities create gendered bodies  AND the marked categories of the tomboy (girls who like sports) and the bookworm(boys who dont)    _______________        _______________    we focus on the uneven ends, rather than the overlap 
   
  We need to pay attention to the obvious contradictions between stereotypic descriptions of womens biology and the realities of womens lives (127)   examples?  Sex differences are interesting in sexist societies that value one group more highly than the other (129).   
and its amazing how durable are commitments to biologically based difference

          <text>Is sex to gender as nature to culture? 
 ATTENDENCE  last time, introduced gender as an analytical concept  social roles, activities; aesthetic appearances; stereotypical characteristics, cultural  
meanings associated with being men and women 
 even if sex difference seen as given in nature, gender is culturally variable and historically changing  concept of gender was meant to stress social/cultural origins of gender inequality  This alignment of sex/gender with nature/culture gets us into loops about what counts as nature and whats culture, and about what nature and culture mean.  
 The so-called culture wars often have to do with arguments about nature, whats natural behavior  and therefore something that should be accepted, not judged (well discuss arguments about sexual identity, gay marriage). OR, natural behavior could be subject to medical treatment.   want to avoid the naturalistic fallacy  that whats natural is good, or inevitable (this is a cultural belief)  readings for today are both by biologists who challenge our assumptions about the nature of women and men  Lets FIRST go through their arguments SECOND assess the analytic limitations of sex/gender as theoretical framework FINALLY ask where that leaves us, terms of how to think about what gender is, or might be  Ruth HUBBARD (Harvard professor emerita) begins article, On Womens Biology by arguing that womens physique, in contrast to mens, is a social construct and a political concept, not a scientific one. What does she mean?  biology is socially constructed (doesnt exist in nature as such, in and of itself)  Rather,  1) biology is perceived, interpreted, described through cultural lenses 2) culture also actually shapes biology    
dialectical relationship nature/culture, cant cleanly separate them becoming more obvious: GM foods, IVF

do not menstruate until 18 yo (high activity levels, diet); get pregnant, breastfeed

          <text> beyond procreative roles 
 
bottom line : biology is not a stable thing in itself; it doesnt ground culture. Therefore sex 
difference cannot really ground gender (if it pr ovides justification, this connection itself 
is not inevitable).  BUT, for now, we DO have ideological i nvestment biological difference -- why? 
biological differences b/w women and men are used to rationalize the stratification of 
the labor force by sex; they do not explain it (124)  NATURALIZATION   
Anne Fausto-Sterling, biologist at Brown University 
 in The Five Sexes she argues that humans do not all fall naturally into neat binary categories of male/female   F-S says that there are not simply two sexes. Why? sex is not just one thing; there are many different variables that go into making it: 
GENES: X and Y chromosomes 
 HORMONES: estrogen, androgens  GONADS: ovaries, testes  GENITAL: clitoris, penis  SECONDARY: hair, breasts;  (BEHAVIOR, gendered)  (note that sexual orientation orientation of sexual desire is yet another matter)  These dont always line up in individuals; there is a spectrum.   estimated 1 in 2,000 babies born with ambiguous genetalia, making it difficult for doctors to pronounce automatically its a girl or its a boy  So here, Fausto-Sterling suggests at least a five-sex model, naming three intersexed 
categories:  herms : so-called true hermaphrodites, who possess one testis and one ovary in same 
organ merms : male pseudohermaphrodites, XYs who have testes and vagina and clitoris (do not  
menstruate) 
ferms: female pseudohermaphrodites, XXs who have ovaries and aspects of male genitals   
clitoris and penis similar organ 
 (note, however, that even these more complex binary correspondences only work if one sex is taken as the model for the other; where, for example, is the vagina in this model?)

          <text>in a later article, she says 5 sexes arent enough  new classifications based also on 
hormones rather than anatomy of gonads and genitalia (problems of classification) HANDOUT 1  
and note that one of these conditions, Progestin-induced androgenization, is iatrogenic , meaning induced by medical treatment of the body 
 Intersex could
 be culturally valued, it HAS been valued historically (and is, elsewhere, 
other cultures, as well see), but it isnt (here). Doctors think theyre doing a favor to children and parents in modifying intersexed individuals.  medical and legal institutions have worked to preserve appearance of dual system  well intentioned, about fitting in  but this is a concern b/c modern Western culture 
is deeply committed to the idea that there are only two sexes.   
commitment to unambiguous binary gender difference AND HETEROSEXUALITY  these are institutionally  fundamental to western societies 
 
 organizes inheritance, who can marry whom, paternity, hereditary titles, eligibility for  
professions, draft registration (earlier, voting rights), anti-sodomy laws 
 sports: Olympics, between 1968-2000 female athletes had to prove theyre female;  chromosome tests, DNA  dozens have failed (excuses made for pulling out)   majority disorders XY but androgen deficiency  no advantage  if the state and the legal system have an interest in maintaining a two-party sexual system, they are in defiance of nature (21)  if we didnt  suppress these differences, what might that mean for society?  
 well read later about the Intersex Society of America, against sex reassignment surgery, also Middlesex (protagonist has androgen insensitivity w/ 5-alpha reductase deficiency) 
 SO, what are the analytical limitations of sex/gender formulation?  1) binary sex difference isnt natural either  sex is not a natural, binary, clearly dimorphic category of difference  rather, we force a range of natural differences into binary categories and take pains to stage dimorphism (tall women not pairing up with short men)   i.e., binary sex difference is not given in nature  so it cannot be a natural underpinning for gender or anything else

          <text>differently (not as politically safe as e ssentialism; owing to our views of nature) 
 doesnt answer the question of why so me people feel one way or the other 
 
how to understand people who are convinced  they were born gay? or for that 
matter, happily heterosexual? 
 
neither  framework necessarily accommodates the variety among, say, lesbians or among 
straight women  and each overemphasizes di fferences between categorical groupings 
  According to Stein, in the1980s lesbian femi nism started coming apart at the seams  
tension b/w born lesbians and women-iden tified lesbians who might still fantasize 
about men but were politically committed to  womens community, resisting patriarchal 
marriage, etc.  its interesting to note that lesbianism as a self-proclaimed identity emerged from the womens movement, as a subset of those challenging restrictive roles for women 
generally (the gay mens movement came out of a different politics)  coming out of the closet  what is this? 
 ritual of self-definition  classically revealing to others ones  deepest, most authentic inner self 
 the confession  
for some, ritual performance that demonstr ated commitment to a cause and to an 
identity (i.e., more about the social  identity than th e personal identity) 
 Katz (22): the social construction of homo sexual persons [he means that in a historic 
sense  including the social construction of essentialism!] has lead to the development of a powerful gay liberation id entity politics based on an ethnic group model. This has 
freed generations of women and men from a deep, painful, socially induced sense of 
shame, and helped to bring about a society- wide liberalization of attitudes and responses 
to homosexuals.  but is there also a flip side to the positive?  reinscribed hetero/homo as essential categories   Who am I? Which am I?  
 identity politics  idea th at what you believe is/should be based on who you are  its 
essentializing, potentially limiting BUT might be politically strate gic; strategic essentialism, form of necessary fiction 
  Is coming out as culturally important today as a rite of passage?   How strong do you see the divi de b/w straight and gay as KINDS of sexuality? any 
differences beyond preferred gender?

          <text>lesbian experience in the United States 
 
Arlene Stein , Sex and Sensibility 
 
what are the major messages of the book? what big picture views did you take away? 
  she argues that sexual or sexuality identitie s based on object of desire (hetero/homo) are 
too restrictive to accommodate the range of subjective experiences that she found in her 
interviews 
 again, we see the tyranny of binary classificatory ideals 
 sexuality binarism rooted in sex/gender binarism  having a sex and having sex with so meone else &gt; having a sexuality 
(well start to look at other ways of  imaging these things next time) 
 are you clear on  sexual essentialism  v. social constructivist  views of sexuality? (9-) 
  essentialism = naturalization, grounded in some sort of biological basis  
(e.g., medicalization); origin born that way, inherent  ascribed
 status 
  
gender essentialism implies that bei ng a woman or man means that youll 
behave, feel, even think in  particular pre-set ways 
 social constructivism says that identity based on sexuality = achieved
 status, 
within specific historical and cultural setti ngs; sexuality itself is plastic, malleable 
 as an identity, sexuality, like gender, is performed following recognizable cultural 
scripts  dress the part, talk the part 
 primary
 lesbians and  elective  lesbians? 
 what do you think? how is th is playing out in the 2000s? 
 is there a similar distinction (primary /elective) among gay men? why/why not? 
  Q: what are the political implications  of essentialism/constructivism? 
 problems with essentialism?   biological determinism  problems with constructivism?    if choice then some think coercive meas ures called for to get people to choose

 SO, both authors suggest, because families are dominant means of recruiting household members, and household economies are part of market economies, family
 relationships 
can and do involve economic exploitation    Q: What do you think? was Engels right? 
 most famously, womens double day or double burden   doing shopping, housework, childcare, cooking on top of full day of paid work  most heterosexual 2-parent households, men doing more of this, but NOT 50%  
(especially not in households where theres no hired help) 
 its not just doing the dishes or doing  the shopping, but making the shopping list; 
mental inventory of whats in the pant ry, anticipating running  out of TP or  
Tylenol 
 not just driving kids around but knowing wh en theyre due for doctors or dental  
  apts, making the play dates, researching day care centers, etc. 
 in theoretical terms, feminist scholars have underst ood this labor in terms of: 
social reproduction  both Rapp and Nakano Glenn 
 
recognizing the economic contri bution of domestic labor 
 
1) includes physical reproduction &amp; daily main tenance of individua ls (keeping labor  
force strong) 
2) but also reproduce class divisions generationally  
 
family is also mechanism for social  reproduction in so far as we learn class dispositions 
as part of our socialization  including class-based gender acquisition 
 these dispositions are called  cultural capital  (Pierre Bourdieu)  language/accent, 
aesthetic tastes, values, knowledge  of Culture,  exposure to cl ass-inflected lifestyle that 
we inherit, alongside economic capital, that facilitates some pe oples success in 
capitalist economy. its the kind of thing th at can make or break a job interview  
 so heres another spike in the  myth of strict meritocracy   we dont all start as blank 
slates, with nothing but our G od-given ability and own industr y; not just economic assets, 
but also cultural assets  Q: What do you envision for yourselves, your families/careers? What do you expect? 
[we havent even begun to take into a ccount two-mommy or two-daddy families]

          <text>E&amp;E and Rapp make this argument  
 
Because they LOVE their husbands/kids.  Because they take pride in th eir home (role well performed) 
Even because its their destiny.   (God or nature) 
 
They dont  say its because their labor is exploited and theyre living under 
conditions of oppression. (until 1970s) 
 thats because of ideological separation of public / private  spheres 
     work / household      for money / for love  Engels: economic and sexual exploitation of women hidden  by the ideology of romantic 
love (marriage  for love as achieved  status) and by the descri ption of womens domestic 
and sexual labor as wifely and maternal duties, not work  After all, what does home signify, symbolize in the modern world? (E&amp;E)  Its a space where LOVE rules. Under modern ideology of gender and family, domestic labor is one way in which wome n have expressed their love. 
 This ideology is what E&amp;E call the romantic solution   buttressed by scientific 
experts finding in womens psyches and biology source of innate nurturing, fragility, 
etc.  keep them (if ideally possible) out of  mean, cruel market and in protective cocoon 
of home. 
  
Like all ideologies, this story masks a very different reality: 
 A) class difference   working class women didnt have  luxury of staying home; their 
bodies and psyches were differe nt, but this evidence wasnt brought into calculation of 
womens nature (theorized  from middle class norm) 
 B) constructed nature of domestic/public   what people do for love and for money  
not so separate as we like to think  as RAPP shows, this division is an ILLUSION: Domestic/work is false distinction   
 domestic labor is absolutely crucial  to capitalist economy; HOW? 
 PLUS beyond  unpaid domestic labor, household site of informal economy :  
 
money lending, coupon-cutting, leaving ki d with neighbor during emergency  
 NOT incidental, or outside, of capitalist production; fully integral  to capitalism.  
It is crucial to the reproduction of the labor power of employees.

          <text>social reproduction 
 Rayna Rapp is clearly in dialogue with Jane Collier, Ehrenreich &amp; English 
 but while Collier and E&amp;E concerned with how gender ideology  changes with economic 
transformation, Rapp is doing something different: shes looking at gaps  between the 
ideologies  of capitalism and the more or less objective realities  of how capitalism works 
on the ground  Q: what are the ideologies of capitalism that she goes after? 
 success is NOT all about achievement  ascribed  status, inheritance, is still relevant  
 
brings up Q of the roll of FAMILY in MODERN SOCIETY 
 Rapp addresses this questi on by first distinguishing  family  from  household : 
 households  = entities in which people actually  live, but also the empirically 
measurable units within which people pool resources and perform certain tasks  
related to the distribu tion of resources.  
 households  (as Rapp puts it) pool resources and are  the basic units in which labor power 
is reproduced and maintained, and therefore fundamental  to wage labor economy 
 and family? relatives (by birth or marriage)  
the family  is the normative, correct way in  which people get recruited into households  
(170)  [nuclear family] 
 
Family , particularly marriage, thus provides opportunities for reproducing and also 
crossing  class lines &gt; household with higher or lower status, more or less resources  
esp. for women:  marrying up or down 
 
Q: why especially important for women?  
 Fredrick Engels , noting these things in 19th C, ar gued that for modern middle class 
women, MARRIAGE is a relationship of SLAV ERY, the crassest prostitution  
 in Engels view, in marital ideal under capitalism: women service men (sexually as well 
as domestically), in return for having material needs satisfied (he br ings home the bacon) 
marriage is relationship of economic e xploitation; husband = bourgoisie; wife = 
proletariat  BUT people themselves dont see this as exploitation.   Q: Why did/do women say they do what they do in the home?

          <text>becoming stay at home moms 
 Do you see it as an either/or choice  career or family?   
putting it that way only makes sense given public/private split! 
 
Why arent we talking about men? Or are we? 
 Is fatherhood  today equivalent to motherhood? should  it be? 
 
why is it when m-c women want fulfilling career and kids, were wanting it all when for m-c men  at least straight  men  its totally the norm, assumed, 
unremarkable?  
 from Nakano Glenn (456): In the traditiona l middle-class household, the availability of 
cheap female domestic labor buttressed white male privilege by perpetuating the concept of reproductive labor as womens work, sust aining the illusion of a protected private 
sphere for women, and displacing conflict aw ay from husband and wife to struggles 
between housewife and domestic.  i.e., Rather than challenge the inequity in  the relationship with their husbands, white 
women pushed the burden onto women with even less power.(446)  As Nakano Glenn importantly notes: When we ask the government/employers for th ings like childcare provisions, we have to 
ask  whos going to be working in thes e childcare facilities? and what will their  lives 
be like? 
 
And this is what Romero  addresses  Who Takes Care of the Maids Children? 
 Q: what social/psychologi cal repercussions from th is piece did you find most 
interesting/surprising? unfamiliar? Or what struck a cord?   ambivalence  damned if do/damned if  dont  all decisions about having/not  
having kids, pursuing/ not pursuing career 
 problem of ideology of choice and achieved status   assume people have lives 
they have b/c of choices theyve made  hold people accountable for life paths 
 motherhood, analogous to career, as achieved status; also fear others will judge us 
 What can we learn from this, analytically?  from Nakano Glenn (455):  
When feminists perceive reproductive labor only as gendered, they imply that domestic labor is identical for all women and that it therefore can be the basis of a 
4 </text>

          <text>common identity of womanhood. By not rec ognizing the different relationships 
women have had to such supposedly unive rsal female experiences as motherhood 
and domesticity, they risk essentializing  gendertreating it as static, fixed, 
eternal, and natural. They fail to take  seriously a basic premise of feminist 
through, that gender is a social construct   interlocks with other systems of 
inequality (Collier) 
 
Do you really get what she means when sh e says: to represent race and gender as 
relationally constructed is to assert that the experiences of white women and women of 
color are not just different but connected  in systematic ways (457)?? example? 
 
race makes a difference to white wome n, too, their experience of gender

          <text>Q: is this rational modern science? or patr iarchal culture? or can we separate the two? 
 
Cheryl Chase  and the ISNA  
 from the website (isna.org):   
The Intersex Society of North America (I SNA) is devoted to systemic change to 
end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genita l surgeries for people born with an 
anatomy that someone decided is not  standard for male or female.  
 
We have learned from listening to individuals  and families dealing with intersex that: 
     * Intersexuality is primarily a problem of stigma and trauma, not gender.      * Parents' distress must not be treated by surgery on the child.      * Professional mental health care is essential. 
     * Honest, complete disclosure is good medicine. 
     * All children should be assigned as boy or girl, wit hout early surgery. 
 
1) what do you think about routine sex assignment surgery on infants? pro/con 
2) what do you think about current tran ssexual treatment of gender dysphoria? 
  NOW: are your arguments concerning intersex  and transsexualism  philosophically, 
logically consistent? 
 
transgender/transexual  support based on essentializing gender identity  body  
is malleable but sex/gender should match up 
 
sex-assignment surgery on infants  ALSO based on sex/gender matching   
in this sense conceptually cons istent w/ transsexualism 
 
but what about intersexual activism  (Chase)?  
based on essentializing biological sex  gender should be malleable  and sex/gender system itself challenged at least in long term; in short term, advocating choosing a gender identity  
 
support of transsexualism is consistent with a major criticism  of sex assignment 
surgery of intersex infants  informed consent  ascription, not achievement, of 
embodiment  
begging question of usefulness and limitations of  appealing to nature, natural fact to 
legitimate social formations  its a political and cultural, not strictly logical, argument   MIDDLESEX: what did you make of Eugenide s fictional account? helpfully  through

WHY today insistence on 2-sex model of ge nder difference? clearly  defined binaries?

marriage law is one thing at stake  Q of marriage defined constitutionally as between a man and a woman  is that such an obvious statement? what about inters exuals? transsexuals? how WOULD the law 
define man/woman today, with ISNA and other groups to raise the question of definition? 
 
begs Q of how, as a society, we should  approach intersexuality 
 protocols established in 1950s that doctors would do sex determinations without seeking 
permission or even really knowledge of parents  idea being that gender acquisition 
would go more smoothly if no ambiguity

Luce) 
 Joan grew up to identify as John, transitioned to masculine persona  had phalloplasty, married a woman [R olling Stone story on MIT server] 
 for the general medical community, what would count as a successful" sex assignment 
or reassignment?  
 
often adoption by the intersexed person of the gender role corresponding to the 
sex assigned by the health care workers + "heterosexual" se xual orientation 
 
not only is equivalence b/w sex/gender at  issue, but heterosexuality as normative 
 
note that the identification of hetero sexuality is contingent upon what gender 
the person was assigned by the me dical professionals during infancy 
 
what are the cultural/ideological underpinnings of this scientific protocol?

 our Q: what are various ways in which culture-bearing humans have interpreted and lived 
with this natural ambiguity? and why? 
 a) cultures have accommodated the ambiguity   hermaphrodite (hermes + Aphrodite) 
 
1) hijra in India not so much a natural cat egory of person, but a role that can  
subsume a range of sex/gender nonconformists 
including intersexuals but also what in  west would call eunuchs (castrati),  
homosexuals, transsexuals, transgendered persons

of Hinduism 
 
the hijra is marginalized, but recognized  theres a conceptual space for intersex

has no popular  name and is treated as a medical condition  5 alpha-

 in US, are there ways of accepting ambiguity? queer identity  not based on sh ared essential identity but on shared nonconformism  
 queer nation or transgende r nation not in thrall to bi nary sex/gender distinction 
in which biology and cultural identi ty and behavior viewed as both categorically different  
and ideally congruent   more commonly (mainstream US),  b) rejecting the ambiguity of intersex  
 
we have no social category to accomm odate ambiguously sexed individuals 
(except pornographic freak shows, like in Middlesex   commoditization!)

HOW? Whats her argument?  Our society describes people in general and job applicants in particular as possessors of inherent traits of character and competencetraits that incorporate cultural notions of gender, race, class, age, and what it means to be able-bodied.  
what working-class gendered assumptions  are made about job-related traits? (141) 
 
 women have manual dexterity, patience  men have physical strength, mechanical aptitude, aggressiveness  JOBS, in turn, are described as having requirements intrinsic to the work itself   heavy v. light-duty work in trades 
microelectronics as delicate, requiring small hands  
 matching of the right person for the job appears to be objective  when subjective 
preconceptions are embedded in depictions of both applicant and job  BUT  in heavy work, do men actually lift engines? 
is welding sheet metal (delicate) less hazardous than other trade work? and dont men dominate surgery? (even with electron microscopes?) 
 At the same time, that women/men do particular kinds of work reinforces certain 
stereotypes. Makes the connection between women/being a woman and nursing (care giving), doing piecework sewing or stationary microscope work (to manufacture computer chips and small electronics) seem  self-evident.  
 Weston: gender permeates not only the bodies and identities of workers, but production itself (139) but this is metaphoric , cultural  not  essential, inherent to the job itself 
 Weston importantly argues:  
Persons do not possess  gender-typed qualities so much as they use symbols to 
fashion presentations of self that incorporate gender. 
 i.e., theres a lot of work that goes into the appearance of difference b/w heavy/light labor exaggerated acting the part  carrying tires instead of rolling them; unnecessary safety risk  being extra macho in ways that make doing the work of a tradesman seem antithetical to being a woman.  Conceptually, not unlike sense that men are taller than women b/c straight couples tend to pair up that way.

          <text>And women who do make it into the trades? How do they get in? How are they coached? 
 
 blue collar dress-for-success program (142-43) 
 these are signs  of the ability to do the job, recognition of what job entails; not 
evidence of actual skill (degree, experience) 
 meaningful gender differences arent essential
; theyre learned, adopted, adapted, elicited 
 The conceptual links between gendered traits and job requirements are so powerful that they can influence what men on the job see when they watch a woman work (142)  Weston concludes
: Fighting occupational sex segregation begins by disentangling 
gendered displays  and notions of gendered capacity  from labor performed (148) 
  
what if we apply this to white collar work like banking (London)  (McDowell)? 
 
women blocked from upper end of banking positions not only through infrastructural 
obstacles (glass ceiling) but because the jobs themselves are gendered masculine  in 
subtle ways that make womens presence incongruous, unthinkable, if not destabilizing 
 examples from McDowell?  its also masculinity , too, thats a performance 
  compulsory heterosexuality limits masculinity  and while some women masquerade as men (but only incompletely), others flaunt stereotypical aspects of femininity   p. 198  you can manipulate things by being more or less female  what do you make of this?     
what if we apply Westons insights to the sciences like physics, professions like 
engineering?

career paths seem rational  a matter of personal choice rather than bias  BUT choice  desire, what people would want ideally; often settling for something,  
choice is often a pragmatic compromise 
 just because career paths today tend to be chosen rather than forced, doesnt mean things are equitable, fair; that weve solved the problems   what Rosalind Williams calls gender bias in occupational tracking far more subtle than gender discrimination  and is more enduring, since cant be legislated against  similarly, Kath Weston recognizes that notion of discrimination glosses rather than explains how committed men in the trades are to the idea that its a mans job  and their genuine surprise to see women be good welders or auto mechanics   Lets turn to  Kath Weston  anthropologist, director of wo mens studies at Harvard, author of first 
research-based book on gay families ( Families We Choose, 1991)  
 
she argues that ideologies of gender, and work ability , still do help keep women out of

How might we think differently about paid labor market when we look at it as being

          <text>Is sex to gender as nature to culture? 
 ATTENDENCE  last time, introduced gender as an analytical concept  social roles, activities; aesthetic appearances; stereotypical characteristics, cultural  
meanings associated with being men and women 
 even if sex difference seen as given in nature, gender is culturally variable and historically changing  concept of gender was meant to stress social/cultural origins of gender inequality  This alignment of sex/gender with nature/culture gets us into loops about what counts as nature and whats culture, and about what nature and culture mean.  
 The so-called culture wars often have to do with arguments about nature, whats natural behavior  and therefore something that should be accepted, not judged (well discuss arguments about sexual identity, gay marriage). OR, natural behavior could be subject to medical treatment.   want to avoid the naturalistic fallacy  that whats natural is good, or inevitable (this is a cultural belief)  readings for today are both by biologists who challenge our assumptions about the nature of women and men  Lets FIRST go through their arguments SECOND assess the analytic limitations of sex/gender as theoretical framework FINALLY ask where that leaves us, terms of how to think about what gender is, or might be  Ruth HUBBARD (Harvard professor emerita) begins article, On Womens Biology by arguing that womens physique, in contrast to mens, is a social construct and a political concept, not a scientific one. What does she mean?  biology is socially constructed (doesnt exist in nature as such, in and of itself)  Rather,  1) biology is perceived, interpreted, described through cultural lenses 2) culture also actually shapes biology    
dialectical relationship nature/culture, cant cleanly separate them becoming more obvious: GM foods, IVF  
examples: !Kung menstruation patterns 
do not menstruate until 18 yo (high activity levels, diet); get pregnant, breastfeed

          <text> beyond procreative roles 
 
bottom line : biology is not a stable thing in itself; it doesnt ground culture. Therefore sex 
difference cannot really ground gender (if it pr ovides justification, this connection itself 
is not inevitable).  BUT, for now, we DO have ideological i nvestment biological difference -- why? 
biological differences b/w women and men are used to rationalize the stratification of 
the labor force by sex; they do not explain it (124)  NATURALIZATION   
Anne Fausto-Sterling, biologist at Brown University 
 in The Five Sexes she argues that humans do not all fall naturally into neat binary categories of male/female   F-S says that there are not simply two sexes. Why? sex is not just one thing; there are many different variables that go into making it: 
GENES: X and Y chromosomes 
 HORMONES: estrogen, androgens  GONADS: ovaries, testes  GENITAL: clitoris, penis  SECONDARY: hair, breasts;  (BEHAVIOR, gendered)  (note that sexual orientation orientation of sexual desire is yet another matter)  These dont always line up in individuals; there is a spectrum.   estimated 1 in 2,000 babies born with ambiguous genetalia, making it difficult for doctors to pronounce automatically its a girl or its a boy  So here, Fausto-Sterling suggests at least a five-sex model, naming three intersexed 
categories:  herms : so-called true hermaphrodites, who possess one testis and one ovary in same 
organ merms : male pseudohermaphrodites, XYs who have testes and vagina and clitoris (do not  
menstruate) 
ferms: female pseudohermaphrodites, XXs who have ovaries and aspects of male genitals   
clitoris and penis similar organ 
 (note, however, that even these more complex binary correspondences only work if one sex is taken as the model for the other; where, for example, is the vagina in this model?)

          <text>in a later article, she says 5 sexes arent enough  new classifications based also on 
hormones rather than anatomy of gonads and genitalia (problems of classification) HANDOUT 1  
and note that one of these conditions, Progestin-induced androgenization, is iatrogenic , meaning induced by medical treatment of the body 
 Intersex could
 be culturally valued, it HAS been valued historically (and is, elsewhere, 
other cultures, as well see), but it isnt (here). Doctors think theyre doing a favor to children and parents in modifying intersexed individuals.  medical and legal institutions have worked to preserve appearance of dual system  well intentioned, about fitting in  but this is a concern b/c modern Western culture 
is deeply committed to the idea that there are only two sexes.   
commitment to unambiguous binary gender difference AND HETEROSEXUALITY  these are institutionally  fundamental to western societies 
 
 organizes inheritance, who can marry whom, paternity, hereditary titles, eligibility for  
professions, draft registration (earlier, voting rights), anti-sodomy laws 
 sports: Olympics, between 1968-2000 female athletes had to prove theyre female;  chromosome tests, DNA  dozens have failed (excuses made for pulling out)   majority disorders XY but androgen deficiency  no advantage  if the state and the legal system have an interest in maintaining a two-party sexual system, they are in defiance of nature (21)  if we didnt  suppress these differences, what might that mean for society?  
 well read later about the Intersex Society of America, against sex reassignment surgery, also Middlesex (protagonist has androgen insensitivity w/ 5-alpha reductase deficiency) 
 SO, what are the analytical limitations of sex/gender formulation?  1) binary sex difference isnt natural either  sex is not a natural, binary, clearly dimorphic category of difference  rather, we force a range of natural differences into binary categories and take pains to stage dimorphism (tall women not pairing up with short men)   i.e., binary sex difference is not given in nature  so it cannot be a natural underpinning for gender or anything else

 The state politicians naive belief in the power of rational choice neg

 Rather than see the maternal pensions and legalized abortion in conflict with one another, viewed together we can see them contribu

          <text> Making Modern Mothers: Ethics and Family Planning in Urban Greece

 can you explain the title?  what cultural changes do I track?   women evaluated on basis of sexuality &gt; mothering  motherhood as purpose &gt; achievement  (consumerism)  controlling nature of sensuality &gt; controlling natu re of f
 ertility 
 questions, points of clarification?  discussion questions:  How do I use "ethics" to unde rstand how gender operates, and has changed, in urban 
Greece? Ho
w does "nature" enter into gender constructions? Do you think this model is 
specific to Greece, or might it be usefully applied to and/or adapted for another cultural setting, like the US?  How would you characterize the moral disc ourse of abortion in Greece? H
 ow does it 
contrast with how abortion is debated in the US? Under what circumstances are Greek 
women seemingly able to reconcile use of  abortion and proper motherhood? In what 
ways might this be both "good" and "bad" for women? 
 How does family planning advocacy in Greece (a nd elsewhere) "rationalize sex"? W
 hat 
repercussions does this have? Given that fam ily planning is something that Greeks want 
to be able to do, how might condoms and other contraceptive methods be better 
advertised and presented to poten tial users? Or sex ed promoted? 
 How is it that the Greek government, which professes nationalist concern over Greece's 
declining birthrate (pronatalism
), offers legal, potentially state-s ubsidized abortion and 
other liberal family planni ng policies? How do intersecting ideologies of gender and 
nationalism (i.e., maternal citizenship) inform  these apparently paradoxical governmental 
positions, and with what repercussions for Greek families?  
In so far as motherhood is a choice, then, pol iticians see it as an either/or choice 
 you are a mother or you are not; if you are, m 
ight as well have many children. 
 Meanwhile, urban Greek women want the choice to have children and a caree
 r 
or employment.   </text>

          <text>6) resistance: gender bending: sex cha nge surgery, cross-dressing, hermaphrodism 
challenge gender binary m/f? or reinforce it in new ways? 
malleability and infinite variety of human behavior  and different ways this behavior is 
bundled into a sense of identity, attached to m
orality, used to legitimate social inequality 
this class is cross-listed with anthropology  Im an anthropologist  and well focus 
(though not exclusively) on an anthropological  approach to study of gender and 
sexuality. 
what is this? 
starting point is CULTURE encompasses both the things people make, do, believe 
and is a fram
e of reference  the conceptual vocabulary through which we perceive 
things, 
that gives meaning to what we make, do, believe 
we dont just HAVE culture (traditions like Mexican quinciera or male circumcision), we THINK and DO culture  its the W
AY we give meaning to things 
EX: its not only the Barbie Doll thats cultural, but what we do with the Barbie Doll  
dutifully dress it up for a Malibu beach party? or hack off its hair and stick pins in its eyebrow? 
Culture dictates and reproduces social norms. But it also provides opportunities for subverting, resisting, m
essing with social norms  especially important to recognize 
how this works in terms of gender: dominant cultural norms, expectations are important, but even more important is how individuals interpret those norms, bend the rules of those norms, in their everyday life 
gender and sexuality, like culture more generally, are both codified by tradition, 
and also improvised in daily life 
SYLLABUS 
This is a CI course  communications intensive 
expected to com

          <text> sexual desire, as an aspect of human nature  
(hormones, bodies as well as feelings, thoughts) 
sexual acts, practices, behavior  what people do sexually  within social 
relations, relations that may be characterized by hierarchy, inequality 
sexual orientation   personal identity (gay, straight, bi) based on the gender of 
ones generalized object of desire 
sexuality has to do with all of these, how desire, practice  and identity  are 
bundled together, in various ways 
SO, in this course well seek to make sense of: 
1) variety in what it means to be, to live as, man/woman, historically and cross 
culturally 
readings will focus largely on the U.S., but will take us around the world 
masculinity and femininity  traits, characteristics, objects associated 
with m
en/women  do not mean the same thing everywhere, and are not 
valued  in the same way everywhere 
moreover, what it means to be woman/man differs not just based on social, cultural context, but on ones relative position within society 
in U.S., how people experience gender, sexuality is very much informed by 
socioeconom
ic class, race or ethnicity, religion, age 
SO, well talk about differences w/in as well as b/w cultures, societies 
2) variety in sexual desires, practices  and how and why they are socially 
accepted 
or stigm
atized 
again, incredibly varied around the world  from sexual modesty of  Muslim women in Middle East to ritualized male homosexuality as part of initiation ceremony in PNG 
3) reproduction of symbolic and structural inequalities between men and women 
what is patriarchy? how does it work? is the US still a patriarchal society? 
gender is an economic, as well as a social, emotional relationship 
4) homophobia and heterosexism  social pressure to conform within binary  
system
s of identity 
5) sexual violence, misogyny (including internalization of psychological 
violence)

          <text>GENDER, SEXUALITY &amp; SOCIETY 
What is GENDER ? 
 the characteristics, traits that differentiate men and women  behavioral, 
aesthetic 
 what it takes to be good at being  a m an/woman  
 its a relational category  gender is not a euphemism for women 
 includes value judgments, positive and negative, associated with masculinity 
and 
fem
ininity  
 things other than people can be gendered  an outfit, a color (blue/pink), a sport 
the analytical concept of gender was introduced in the 1970s to indicate the social roles, characteristics, and values assigned  to m
ales and females in a given society; gender 
understood as historically and cross-culturally particular 
gender is social, not natural, not fixed  in nature  biological or cosm ological 
important implication: gender hierarchy, patriarchy, is thus social, not natural  not inevitable 
sex/gender system  of difference (sex = biology + gender = social norm
 s) 
nature/culture 
this meaning of gender has entered public, commonplace understanding 
in this class, we will use gender to mean social, cultural expectations and actions;  
and sex to refer to 
physiological characteristics 
HOWEVER, its important to note that the sex/gender system  has been challenged 
theoretically 
we wont  be talking about gender as simply  the cultural elaboration  of fundam ental 
differences, given in nature, between women, as a whole, and men, as a whole 
and well begin on Monday with a discussion of why  the sex/gender system , while useful,  
is inadequate for the task of understanding what it means to be a man/woman  
readings for Monday, by biologists, will explain why  come to class with a few 
sentences, drawing from
 the articles, with at least 2 arguments about the analytical limits 
of the sex/gender system
NOW let me ask  
W
hat is, or what do we mean by, SEXUALITY ? (as opposed to sex difference)

          <text>class # 21: gender and citizenship 
today I want to expand the parameters of our  analysis to think a bout how nationalism  and 
the interests of state governments help to construct gende r, make sexuality meaningful in 
particular ways 
juxtapose two articles by anthropologist R hoda Kanaaneh (who grew up in a Palestinian 
f
amily in Israel) 
1) Boys or Men?  discusses how mascu linity  is informed by state citizenship,  
nationalism; theres a common analysis of  the militarization of masculinity 
BUT the case of Palestinian Israelis presents interesting complication   
here, where theres popular opposition  to the state, a critique of state 
collaborators (Arab soldiers volunteering to serve in the Israeli army) is 
carried out in a gendered idiom  militarism  does not represent a valued 
masculinity 
2) in previous work, culminating in Birthing the Nation  (2002), Kanaaneh presents an 
analysis, again from
 case study of Palestinian Israelis, of how state interests concerning 
population issues have been forwarded through the control of wo mens bodies, through 
regulating their sexual ity and reproductive capacity  a case of population policy being 
played out through reproductive politics (we ll see another example next week, Greece) 
let me talk generally, and then get into sp ecifics of case of Arab  citizens of Israel 
first, what do I mean by gendered citizenship? 
citizenship entails the rights and obligations  of a m ember of a nation in return for 
protection by a state 
what those rights/obligations have been  has historically been marked by gender 
example of gendered diffe rence in citizen ship? 
suffrage  women got vote in US in 1920 military service has been expected of men but not women (exception of 
Jewish citizens of Israel) 
gendered citizenship plays out more subtly, too 
human reproduction  family size, how desire d f
 amily size is achieved (birth control), 
etc.  is of great political interest 
Its through being born into families that citizens are m ost often made 
case study: Israel, state of majority immigr ant Jewish population (any Jew can apply for 
autom
atic citizenship), plus indigenous Ar ab minority population  state borders do not 
map neatly onto national ones: meant to be  state for entire Jewish diasporic nation. </text>

          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>masculinity is crucial to self-identity and la beling by others, but not the standard soldier 
masculinity  as member of minority populatio n, joining the state army is seen as 
traitorous  figured as immatur e masculinity (boys seduced by guns) 
role of state in framing rhetoric? 
parallels in US history? 
assimilation v. selling out  civil rights in US 
RACE: African American military servi ce du ring WWII (segregated regiments) 
sparked 1950s civil rights movement (a nd anti-assim ilationist movement of 
Malcolm X) grounds for contes ting second-class citizenship 
SO: gender is forged no t only within economic relations, but within conditions set by 
states ; government policies a nd nationalist rhetoric </text>

          <text>Maintaining a fairly consistent RATIO, 20 Arab/80 Jewish is important to the very notion 
of Israel as a Jewish state  otherwise, w ould have to be recognized as a binational 
state 
women have served states in two senses  as symbolic bearers of the Nation: 
quantitative  bearers o
f the nations children, and qualitative  bearers of tradition 
1) quantitative: birthing citizen s, carry the perpetuity of the nation in their wom bs 
here, womens civic duty is about producing numbers through reproducing, 
birthing, new citizens  new workers, new so ldiers for security (if mandatory 
military service, size of army dir ect reflection of size of population) 
pronatalism v. antenatalism (Chinas one child policy) 
Israel (Greece, Romania): pronatalist 
these states have presented wom
en with aw ards for the patriotic  duty of producing 
very large families  Mothers of the Na tion in Israel, awards to Heroine 
Mothers (10 kids) was stopped after it became clear that Arab women were 
winning most of the awards  
Clearly, national projects are invested not ju st in sheer num bers of a population, but in 
generating the right SORTS of  numbers, people, citizens 
2) qualitative  reproducing the cultural trad itio ns and values that bind together the 
nation, keep them unique, which women do by socializing  children  nurturing specific 
cultural values  and by  setting the good example 
August Comte (writing in th e early years of the F rench Republic)  said women 
should serve as the repository of moral valu es, which will be preserved in them  if 
they stay out of politics and business.  The im age of Woman on a pedestal. 
when public/private spheres separated, also  gendered  had to do with rise of 
nation-state, as well as wage labor and capitalism 
Kanaanehs work: Palestinian citizens of Israel have adopted this dual outlook: 2 
reproductive strategies, both of which ideolo
gically related to wo mens reproduction of 
Palestinian nationalism 
1) birth more babies to overwhelm the Jewish Is raelis, just as they fear (quantitative) 
2) have fewer children, educate them well, and present a stronger front in that way  
(qualitative) </text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>Kanaaneh calls this the reproductive meas ure  family size used as indicator of 
how modern/traditional you are  not ju st econom ic class, but social outlook 
in global context 
Now lets think about additional LEGACIE S and CONSEQUENCES of these ideas 
In particu
lar, real-life reperc ussions of womens r ole as bearers of the nations children 
and traditions. 
Kanaaneh: women are considered mark ers of national bound aries, not only 
sym
bolically, but physically as well 
If women are charged with guaranteei ng the perpetuation of the hom eland, its 
people and culture, theres the problem that  fem ale bodies are permeable  in the 
same way the national territory in war is vulnerable 
physically : 
fe
male bodies are permeable just as the national territory in war is vulnerable 
this equation makes women particularly vulnerable to sexual violence  during and 
following war 
symbolically : 
women, like the land/nation, mark borders of a people and also seen as the 
property of men that, like land, must be defended 
military recruitment posters  nation as female 
problem of gay men in the military? lacking wife/kids? 
clearly, reproduction is politics 
Susan Gal and Gail Kligman ( The Politics o f Gender After Socialism ) argue that public 
debates about reproduction make politics 
e.g., Kanaanehs reproductive measure  how traditional or modern? 
abortion debate in the U.S.  for some, a political litmus test 
what about MASCULINITY and state citizenship? 
if womens  ultim ate service to nation, civic duty, is to give birth to male citizens and 
sacrifice them as soldiers, mens ultimate civic duty has been depicted as willingness to die 
for their country 
military service = masculine citizenship 
whats the twist in Kanaanehs study of  Palestin ian soldiers in Israeli army? </text>

          <text>other ways of c onceiving gender/sexualities 
 
first, I want to underscore the point that not  only are identity cat egories oversimplified, 
individual identities are not necessarily st able  may not plot on graph as single dot 
 this is why anthropologists  like Weston talk about the uses of gender, gender-typed 
qualities: men and women make use of  both femininity and masculinity 
 does it make sense to speak in similar way about sexuality? uses of sexuality, sexuality-typed qualities?    readings for today: different articulations between categ ories of gender and of sexuality 
 
Gilbert Herdt 
well-known anthropologist, stud ied Sambia in Highlands of Papua New Guinea in 1970s, 
with return trips throughout  the 1980s; now heads Human Sexuality Program, San 
Francisco State U. 
 his work addresses 1) the role of ritual  in gender/sexuality 
2) the multiple ways gender/se xuality can be interrelated 
3) distinction b/w sexual acts and orientations (as identity)  according to Herdt, the Sambia can be said to have a sex/gender system  strong binary 
oppositions between male and female, accompanied by a strict gender division of labor 
 but they do not not have an equivalent sexuality/gender system 
 instead, male sexuality and female sexu ality not equivalent categories 
female = natural and heterosexual (orientation, acts) male = cultural and sequentially bisexual (first homosexual, then heterosexual)  first, notable that they regard females as more naturally complete  less in need of ritual elaboration (seemingly differe nt from European traditions)  
 why?  ritualized male homosexuality  secret rites, hidden from women (they dont know) 
 if blood makes femaleness, semen make s maleness and must be ingested,  
culturally acquired through initiation rituals 
 FILM CLIP  for all he narrates rituals as men making men  or masculinizing men theres quite a bit 
of feminine imagery!

          <text>indeed, sex-segregated initiation rites a nd male homosocial/homosexual events are 
infused with feminine elements  gender is nt absolute difference in ideology here  
 
 semen = mothers milk (when the semen falls into my mouth, I think its the  
milk of women  easily identified as homo sexual experience?) 
 penis = flute; breast = flute  flute is animated by female spirit [male body is vessel; again, seeming inversion]   
and the ritualized insemination necessary to make real men prepared to  
survive heterosexual encounters  with women for procreation!  
 
ritual embodies contradiction (ideology is never seamless) 
 ultimately, whats ritualized here is male prestige , rather than sexua l orientation or 
essential gender differentiation      Annick Prieurs Memas House  
 lets get a handle on the terminology: joto =  (passive) homosexual, prefers men exclusively and usually passive role 
jota = feminine passive homosexuals (queens) vestida = jota who consistently dresses as woman 
 
core of these definition is preferring pa ssive role, in keeping with feminine 
presentation  ideological link b/w position  and appearance  
 femininity in man suggests wants to be penetrated 
masculinity suggests wants to penetrate  
mayate = masculine men who penetrate jotas + also have sex with women  
(external label  they would simply call themselves men; acts  identity) 
 tortilla = mayate sometimes takes pa ssive position with men, sometimes active 
 bisexual = tortilla = internacional = alternating active/passive roles   [implicit  if take active role with men, then will also have sex with women]  buga = term used by homosexuals who designa te men they think only have sex with  
 women; only penetrating role; also used to describe manly men, macho

          <text>gender and status  in agrarian societies 
 
last time we talked about modes of gender acq uisition: socialization, ritual  ways that 
kids learn theres a si gnificant distinction between girls and boys  put in different 
clothing (especially for important occasions ), ritualized differentiation (counting off 
boy/girl for dodgeball). And they learn that to be a good girl/boy often means not acting 
like the other  big boys dont cry (meaning that girls do); girls should sit with their 
legs closed (meaning boys dont have to).  if gendered rituals make meanings explic it, the power of gender socialization  (as 
opposed to formal ritual) lies in its implic itness, often glossed as common sense  
just the way things are wit hout explicit reason given:   share a sense of what is meant 
by boys will be boys, be a good girl  while powerful, kids internalize gender lessons only to an extent  theres often a gap b/w soci al reality and ideology 
 
definition of ideology : official story told, retol d, to articulate and, perhaps, 
explain status quo, often ine quality; dominant norms, values sedimented in our 
institutions, ritualized in public  events, elicited by others 
 in patriarchal societies, gender ideology buttresses male prestige  i.e., masculinity often more valued than  femininity; gender-neutral = masculine 
rather than feminine, like tomboy  and, as well start to see in our readings , gender ideology can also reinforce other 
forms of social inequality : racism, class hierarchy 
 
BUT ideology is never totalizing, never co mplete story  again, masks fissures, 
tensions, contradictions, exceptions  much about gender ideology evidenced in  childhood has to do with adults seeing 
what we expect to see, not noticing  or att aching social significance to  
behavior that challenges norms  AS well see in Middlesex  
 SO, to understand gender, cannot merely ask how men/women act or behave (assuming that there is a meaningful differen ce) but rather at how individuals use gender ideologies 
creatively, strategically  or, perhaps, self-destructively  
 this is an argument Jane Collier makes   p. 101; To understand conceptions of gender,  we cannot look [merely] at what  
men and women are or do, but rather must  ask what people want and fear, what 
privileges they seek to clai m, rationalize, and defend.  
and how they use gender to do so

          <text> 
definition of  status  of an individual = ri ghts due to and duties expected of one; persons 
position relative to others (usu ally hierarchical in some  way) in same society  
 2 basic types of statuses, having to do with recruitment  ascribed : assigned to individual,  often (not nec.) from birth (e.g., lineage) 
 achieved : gained through special effort or ch oice; requiring special knowledge, skill,  
qualities (e.g., occupation) and that are re garded as responsibility of individual 
 do you think gender is better viewed as  an ascribed or achieved status? 
 some statuses can be either ascribed or achieved  marriage  (arranged or chosen) 
 agrarian  societies tend to emphasize ascribed statuses  (clan, age, ar ranged marriage) 
how does Collier explain this? 
 
capitalist  societies clearly based on ideal of achieved statuses  (educational degree, 
occupation, chosen marriage)  
how are differences and in equalities e xplained?  
  statuses, whether ascribed or achieved, imply roles -- refers to the dynamic  aspect of 
status; what people do and how they do it, what relationships with others they engage in, 
as person of particular status position  
all statuses must be maintained through proper performance of roles 
 
Collier is describing a shift in RO LES attached to PROPER WOMANHOOD 
 well continue discussion of this historical shift tomorrow

          <text>this week and next well study historical shifts in gender ideology  -- and ways that people 
have maneuvered within those ideologies to make status claims, in European/American 
societies 
 reference HANDOUT (factors affecting gender roles)  use it to assess not so much 
degree of gender inequality  more/less patriarchal  but pr imary ideological reasoning 
for gender inequality in differe nt cultures and societies 
 beginning with subsistence base
  economic system (h/f; agrarian; chattel slavery; 
market capitalism) points to labor and resource allocation as  basis of social inequality
 next couple classes well look at rise of capitalism and how  that affected gender and 
sexual relations  today well talk about early modern agrari an Europe (Greece, Asia Minor; Spain) 
 pairing Jane Collier and beginning of Middlesex, which is historically  and culturally well-
researched  
 
looking at handout, we should be able, on basis of readings, to say something of agrarian 
Mediterranean about #s 1-5  and more, about how these are related to one another 
 1) subsistence base  contributi ons to material needs of group 
 productive labor; division of labor 2) distribution &amp; exchange of goods &amp; services 3) child-rearing 4) sexuality 5) symbolism &amp; ritual 6) extraordinary events (who deals, and how, with unexpect ed crises, illness, etc.) 
   one key site where these factors intersect is FEMALE CHASTITY   (premarital virginity + marital fidelity) 
 WHY, according to Collier, do we often find a preoccupation with female chastity, sexual 
modesty, in agrarian societie s? (also pastoral ones  wher e subsistence based on herding 
cattle, camels, etc.  middle east, east Africa)  Collier: To question the chastity of a mans mo ther is to question his right to the status 
he claims as his. In such a world, womens bodies appear as gatewa ys to all privileges 
The status and reputation of a family thus rest on the degree to which its women are protected from penetrationby womens own sense of sexual shame, by being locked away, and/or by the courage of family  men in repelling seducers (101) 
 this exemplifies one way in which gender is a vector of social  status, and therefore, of 
inequality/hierarchy  this is Colliers thesis

          <text>do western sexual identities travel? 
 are our categories and assumptions about the meaning of sexuality, developed in the  
US/Western Europe, applicable  to non-western settings?  
or do they obscure our understa nding of sexuality elsewhere? 
 can insights from other cultural settings be brought back to shed light on the possible 
limitations of our own assumptions about sexua lity, gender, identity here in the US? 
 Anick Prieurs book offered our first pointer   men having sex with men doesnt have 
the same meaning in terms of identity, gende r, sexuality in Mexico and in the US 
 Swarr and Nagars article on experiences of women in same-sex relationships in India 
and South Africa  clearly argue that the voc abulary, assumptions developed in western 
academic contexts do not  necessarily do justice to these womens experiences  speak to 
their concerns  according to Swarr and Nagar, what are limiting assumptions of western feminism, regarding lesbianism?  western feminism tends to view lesbianism first and foremost in terms of desire   
in the west theres an increasing emphasis on external expression of inward feeling, as 
captured in coming out narratives  but in Third World contexts (or rural, working 
class contexts of US) this can be oversha dowed by NEEDS  economic survival, social 
survival (including threat of violence)  
western theorizing of sexuality has focused on the INDIVIDUAL  as unit of analysis 
valuing of autonomous individual aut horing her own destiny (achievement) 
but in many parts of the world, local ideol ogy cannot separate individual from FAMILY, 
CLAN, COMMUNITY  shared resources, shared  status, shared survival strategies 
 
this contributes to subjective experience of even something as private as sexuality 
 they write, we seek to reconceptualize desire  itself not as innate  or inherent but as 
emerging in conjunction with processes such as development, neocolonialism, apartheid, 
and liberalization (495)  from reading, can you explain what they mean  by offering example, illustration of how 
the politics of intimacy, sexual ity, and access to resources inte rtwine in everyday lives? 
 stories of Geeta and Manju in Chitrakoot, India; Cora and Phakamile in Soweto, SA 
 what take home messages di d you get from this article? 
  even poorest women in most patriarchal setti ngs are not bereft of sexual agency  they 
too have emotional lives  not ju st prerogative of the privileged

 complexity  of identity questions  not just inter sectionality (gender / sexuality / race 
/ class), not just carving identity into different slices of pie  
  problem w/ identity politics: experien ce isnt strictly based on who we are 
 also our personalities, our family rela tionships, our luck in love  things  
that are never given demographic boxes 
 extending intersectionality means reconceptualizing differen ce with reference to 
material and emotional specificitites   from struggles over ri ghts (do women have full 
citizenship? is homosexuality  legally recognized?) and re sources (can women have 
exclusive access to money th ey earn?) to intimate rela tionships (family support? 
economic strings attached [jotas]? frie ndships, emotional support?)  sorts of 
relationships people enter in to with or without labels 
   sex for money in Papua New Guinean Huli, Holly Wardlow  terminology: from prostitution  to sex work  to sexual networking  &amp; survival sex   
what different meanings implied in these terms?  sex work emphasizes labor component (safe, legal, fairly paid)  income-generating activity  rather than totalizing identity   
 reducing stigma 
 but still embedded moralization: if work th en has to be acceptable, even  
perhaps virtuous (especially if supporting kids) 
 of course, even these caveats cant be generalized  again: cant assume that similar-looking practices (women and men having illicit,  
hidden, one-off sex after which man gives woman some money) mean the same things in different places 
 in Wardlows interpretation of Papua New Guinean Huli passenger women, economic factors  scarcity, poverty  alone cannot ac count for or fully explain commoditized 
sex   these women arent exchanging sex for m oney strictly out of economic necessity 
why, then?   resistance against restrictive feminine  roles tied to  reproduction 
anger and revenge against male kin who do not behave  
 again, use of personal narratives to illustrate how identities
 are produced through 
combination of broader social forces  and idiosyncratic personal factors

2 of 18 were women whose fathers killed thei r mother or older sister; wanted to make 
themselves unmarriagable so fathers wouldnt profit from their bridewealth 
 
HOW does the PNG case help us reali ze the cultural logics behind common 
interpretations of prostitution/sex work in th e US  make it thinkable, even natural  
what are assumptions of  our cultural logic? 
 1) women = sexually desirable objects  (mens desire is active force) 
2) sex as a commodity  object of desire me n willing to purchase, and from other side,  
act of sex = compensable labor (oldest profession) in which men are purchasers 
public/private  sex for $  intimate, emotional 
 why dont these cultural logics help make sense of PNG situation? not applicable? 
ideology of desire 
men are the objects of desire  cultivate beauty to attract women women, not seen as naturally beautiful, mu st often resort to magic to attract men 
 what about the men? what are they paying for? 
 sometimes nontraditional sexual practices would never ask of wives  more, paying for modern masculinity  men are resisting sexual taboos,  
based on procreative/kinship ethic 
 passenger women say that when a man offers $ for sex, evidence that hes so  
consumed with desire that hes overcome his fear of women and their vaginas  out of gratefulness rather than contempt  which women read 
as their vanquishing of men 
  with these cross-cultural comparisons in mind, return to Q:   whats problematized around gender/sexuality in contemporary US?  what are the 
questions asked of ourselves and of each other? assumptions within which current 
debates about gender/sexuality  from sexual identity, to transgender, to commoditized 
sex  are articulated?

 this is not to say that women shouldnt do ultrasounds  or enjoy them! 
 but its important to recognize unintended conceptual implications of what we do 
 
its not evil that people buy all pink for gi rls/all blue for boys, but it can 
contribute to enduring belief in fundament al differences  including capacities 
 between boys/girls 
 next Monday well discuss a counter exam ple for thinking about abortion  what it is 
and what it means  from my research in Greece 
 FIRST, lets talk about what Rosalind Pe tchesky has to say about the power of fetal 
images  and their relevance to abortion in the US. This important article was published 20 
years ago, before the technology was so routinized  shes not  arguing that ultrasound, or other repro technologies, absolutely bad  rather, 
shes interested in the cultural assumptions that make them thinkable, and the social 
factors that inform their use, interpretation, meaning  e.g., fetal images have become ubiquitous in  pro-life campaigns. So ubiquitous that it 
might seem obvious to you, but its not [again, contrast with Greece next week] 
 how did this campaign begin? where did the idea come from? 
 NE Journal of Medicine  article in early 80s suggesti ng that early fetal ultrasounds 
resulted in maternal bonding and possibly fewer abortions  based on 2 isolated 
cases, not scientifically controlled for  basically, the article simply forwarded the 
hypothesis  but the National Right to Life Committee jumped on this, made The Silent Scream  
featuring a 12 week-old fetus being aborted from the victims point  of view  but is 
it?  what does Petchetsky say in her analysis of the film?  its the view from the camera, from an outside observer  neither from the perspective of a fetus or pregnant woman  
fetuses cant speak or scream. 
 this is obvious whats less obvious is the more subtle transfer of  meaning  of what it means to be a 
person who can scream or speak or has a name or has rights  a social person  to a fetus, a potential person. Anticipating personhood
. 
 anticipated personhood seems to go hand and hand with anticipated motherhood:

          <text>if self-sacrifice is expected of  mothers, then shouldnt it be expected of pregnant women? 
nurturance now begins at conception  producin g the perfect baby  (blaming self for 
defect in fetus/baby, as we saw in Landsmans article) 
 
in pro-life rhetoric, fetus portrayed as bot h helpless victim and autonomous, heroic 
individual  fetal images are the perfect symbol for this duality  HOW? what meanings are read from this? what analogy does Petchesky make?   fetus as free-floating  no pregnant woman in sight, just hanging on cord 
 abstract individualism (homunculus)  spaceman fetus  floating in space, daring, brave, but fragile  its powerful in pro-life rhetoric  making fetal personhood, after al l, is requisite for 
fetal rights  more, makes it seem self-evi dent  but only because we read visual 
images literally , as reality  objective representations, as if the camera extended our 
own subject position, access to object  brings viewers and object into same reality 
 BUT, pro-life use of fetal imagery is selective, somewhat misleading 
 
90% of abortions happen w /in first trimester (up to 12-14 weeks), only 1% after 
20 weeks (Massachusetts has a 23 week limit) 
  but the most common public fetuses are late term 
at 12 weeks (limit for on demand abortion), the fetus is just over 2 inches long 
 the head is the same size as rest of the body 
 
 also, picturing an intact fetus is misleading 
  even when late-term abortions are performed theyre generally therapeutic, when  
fetus had, say, a skull that wasnt fully fo rmed or other massive defect OR when 
theres some medical emergency regardi ng the woman  its NOT elective; very 
late abortions are nearly al ways performed on women who want  that child 
 amniocentisis can only be done between 18-20 weeks, some as early as 16 weeks (though with increased risk of miscarriage)  level-2 diagnostic ultrasound (to screen fo r ancephaly, spina bi fida) at 20 weeks 
 we can think about how this context of cu ltural representations of fetuses and their 
relationship to pregnant wome n might help us understand Linda Laynes ethnography of 
pregnancy loss (which she prefers to miscarriag e, which suggests women mis-carried, 
did something wrong  like in Landsmans article)  Laynes article puts ultrasound in context  of social  aspect of pregnancy, other things

          <text> visualizing the fetus 
 todays articles address the relationship be tween a pregnant woman and her fetus.  
how that relationship is e xperienced by pregnant women and represented by others is 
obviously fraught in this country b ecause its become so tied up in abortion politics 
 HANDOUT  (encyclopedia entry)  today I dont want to hash out the abortion deba te itself; rather, want  to see if we can 
ferret out some of the a ssumptions that underlie how abortion is debate d in this country 
 as a debate over relative rights  with Roe, legal status of abortion is framed in te rms of individual right s: legally, right to 
privacy b/w woman and her docto r. more popularly, right to choose whether to carry a 
pregnancy to term  but this is misleading, b/c in legal terms its a negative right  
free of government interference, not a positive right of access  3 states have only 1 aborti on provider (including S.D.) 
 criminalizing abortion has NEVER ended its  practice  legal a bortion doesnt mean 
abortion v. no abortion, it means safe, medica lly regulated abortion v. unsafe, unregulated 
abortion  but to argue against the right  to choose, anti-abortioni sts have championed right-to-
life: pitting one set of rights against the other and reframing issue of life 
 
more, the language of individual rights pits mother against  fetus  makes abortion seem 
obviously antithetical to motherhood, a sign of  the rejection of maternal values and 
nurturance [see Faye Ginsburgs Contested Lives] 
 
abortion is far more common than many Americans might believe roughly 20% of all pregnanc ies in US end in aborti on (13% in miscarriage) 
abortion rate dropped in the 1990s (under Clinton)  reasons? ( not stronger maternal 
values)  better contraceptives available  morning-after pill available  stronger economy (21% women having a bortion give reason of insufficient  
resources) 
abortion rate has gone up under Bush for inverse reasons [stats from Guttmacher Institute]  framing abortion question as  matter of rights of woman against  rights of fetus is not 
inevitable; this is makes sense only within a particular cultural logic 
 right to life movement and commercialized ultrasound emerge from (and reinforce)  
same shift: referring to fetus as se parate and distinct from woman

according social significance to  behavior that challenges norms 
 insight : we should look for gendered practices , not gender roles   see distinction? 
 how individuals use gender creatively, strate gically v. how gendered individuals act or 
behave (phrasing question that way inev itably leads to overgeneralization) 
  lets talk more about RITUAL   
Rites of Passage 
ritualized occasion of transition from one status, social position, age to another 
can be seen to happen at a variety of scales

          <text>gender acquisition 
 turning to sociological and an thropological approaches to th e study of gender: think about 
how gender as a source of individual identity in tersects with gender as a social category, set 
of relationships  how do individuals learn gender  that they ARE gendered (have a gender) and how to live 
up to expectations for what this means? how do ideas about gender get reproduced  and transformed  from one generation to the next?  recognition that gender is lear ned behavior beginning from 1950s insight of Simone de 
Beauvoir, One is not born, but rather becomes a woman (or man)  BUT this can fall back into sex:gender dich otomy  we are born i n nature but develop 
through culture  WE want to keep in mind caveat learned from  biologists, that nature and culture are 
NOT entirely separate, independent domains  i.e., to talk about culture begs for 
consideration of the physiological or supernatur al/divine (both of which can be aspect of 
nature  human nature)  as Ruth Hubbard  demonstrated, culture  is not just thought 
and enacted, but embodied  how is gender learned? and how does it come  to be embodied? to shape our bodies? 
 
1) socialization, by  
A) example (mimicking) 
B) elicitation (how children are treated, rewarded/punished) 
 2) ritual  formalized laying out of cultural principles, norms for behavior, aesthetics, etc. 
baptism, debutante ball  
 
in any culture, these are related to local theo ries of human nature, including scientific and 
religious ones    readings  for today, from A World of Babies   posing the question, what if Dr. Spock lived 
in Micronesia or Bali?   explaining socialization in terms that are cons istent with local, cultural ideas of natural 
processes (material and divine) and of personhood  Q: what did you find interesting in th ese pieces, reading them together? 
 themes:  relationship to spirit world  Do babies have the devil in  them, or are they divine?

          <text> paradigmatically in life crises  such as? pregnancy, childbirth, death, marriage 
 adolescence (Mead)  3 phases of a rite of passage (from Vi ctor Turner, elaborating Van Gennep): 
 1) separation  physical separation of individual from rest of society  symbolic separation from past   2) transition (the lim inal period; margin) 
 betwixt &amp; between  neither old status nor new one; statusless, identityless 
 no longer classified and not  yet classified  nonperson 
 this is the stage he elaborates  gaining of secret knowledge ; training 
 often symbolic cleansing  / rebirth (bloodletting) 
 3) (re)incorporation  return to society, but in new position, with new status &amp; new obligations &amp; rights    new roles  e.g., birth (transition for mother to certai n kind of female adulthood; also for baby) 
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:  1) re-narrate Ifaluk birth as  a Rite of Passage  what elements fit the 3 stages? 
 
2) what rites of passage are us ed to frame transitions related to gender/sexuality in the US? 
 
 what are defining rituals in making a boy/girl? or graduating to adult man/woman? 
  
what do these rituals say about whats in child rens nature? 
 
3) what other rituals teach lessons about  appropriately gendered behavior, values? 
  sum up
: learning gender  as an aspect of child  socialization  happens not only with 
reference to ideas about biol ogy (sex)  but ideas about co smology, procreation, what it 
means to be human; basic moral values; notions of personhood  
is individualism or communalism stressed?  
is being nurturing seen  as gendered, or not? 
 infant care practices reflect this set of beliefs  directed at protecting the life of children, but 
also to guide children toward becoming accepted members of their societies  
eg: co-sleeping  or separate beds/rooms  reflects moral values  developing

2) wage labor introduced division between paid and unpaid work   qualitative 
difference between work done in household  and work done in market  (unlike agraria
n) 
this is significant  work that doesnt earn wages suddenly worth less  today, tendency to see &amp; accept symbolic and st ructural separation b/w different kinds of 
labor  in ma
rket society: 
 1) productive labor
  
  in market economy, labor that generates wages, income = purchasing power to meet 
basic needs  commercial transa ctions in market society 
 and other  kinds of labor that people do, but are not seen as productive in sam
e way 
 2) reproductive labor
  making and raising babies; phys ical and emotional labor of 
feeding and nurturing; social izing good citizens and future workers and members of 
ethnic/religious communities 
 
sustaining people on a daily basis: cooki ng, cleaning, feeding, se xing (conjugal right 
of sexual servicing), taking care of sick and elderly  
3) work of status enhancement
 (middle classes)  promote so cial worth and prestige of 
families and husbands. Raising well-adjusted children and be smart consumers. Stay at home mom has become symbol  of middle-upper class status. 
 
4) kinwork and community work
  maintaining kin networks through sharing work 
and resources; also writing letters, arranging family even ts and parties, emotional 
support. Narrator in Middlesex : Didnt my mother quiz me on uncles and aunts and 
cousins, too? She never quizzed my brother, because he was in charge of snow 
shovels and tractors, whereas I was supposed to provide the feminine glue that keeps 
families together, writing thank-you notes and remembering everybodys birthdays and name days. (72)

politics).

          <text>The Woman Question 
 Collier writes:  To understand, gender, we must unde rstand social inequality. And , if gender 
conceptions are idioms fo r interpreting and manipul ating so
cial inequality, then we 
should expect notions of femininity and masculinity to change when one organization of inequality gives way to another. (101)  Collier is writing about 20th C rural Spain, but similar dynamics took place in England, US, in 19th C  transition from agrarian so ciety (what Ehrenreich and English call the 
Old Order) to modern, industrial society  Ehrenreich and English ALSO write that sh ift in subsistence base was accompanied by 
shift in the idiom
 in whic
h people unders tood inequality  haves and have-nots  AND 
thus also understand gender, sexuality, marriage, etc.   E&amp;E frame discussion of the shift in gender id eologies with a shift from agrarianism
  to 
market capitalism in 19th C England and America as The Woman Question   how would you phrase The Woman Question? 
 what are women to do/what are women good for, when wage labor  reorganized 
how people thought about work 
 wage labor  is different fr
om all previous labor re lations (products of labor could be sold; 
laborers could be sold (slaves, indent ured servants); but not labor itself) 
 w
age labor  = idea that E can buy Ws labor for X  amount of time, and by extension all 
products of that labor for duration  of that time. 
 Requires the idea that a worker is free to SELL his own labor; that is, need sense that a person OWNS his own labor power (productive capacity) (as if  property) and thus can 
sell this belonging for $ wages.  
as opposed to the vision of a person as a dependent; who is not free to dispose 
of his/her labor because dependent o
n the support of another person (indentured 
servant, appr
entice, tenant farmer, sl ave  AND in 19th C, woman; legally 
belonged to father and then husband [classic patriarchy]) 
 what did wage labor system do that was so  significant for how we think about social 
relations?  1) notion that get paid what labor is worth  different ki
nds of labor are worth more 
than others  were deserving of what we have b
ecause weve earned it  achieved 
status  if we arent successful, its our fault; dont have what it takes (ideology)

Island  now, lets return to Colliers thesis  which E&amp;E are in agreement with   To understand conceptions of gender, we cannot look at what men and women are or do, but rather must ask what people want and far, what privileges they seek to claim, 
rationalize, and defend. To understand, gender,  we m
ust understand social inequality. 
And, if gender conceptions are idioms for interpreting and ma nipulating social inequality, 
then we should expect notions of femininity and masculinity to change when one organization of inequality  gives way to another.

transformations in local power relations w ill upset patriarchal bargains  may lead 
women, depending on patriarchal bargains, to adopt seemingly conservative attitudes 
about change 
 
ex: returning to th e veil  Egypt, Turkey (secular states) 
 
new opportunities for women to work outside the home, but need to demonstrate  
adherence to virtue of feminine modest y  veil allows for modesty in public 
spaces, allows new social actions to be incorporated into older values  signals 
that women are still worthy of  respect, protection (expres sion of old values in new 
social reality  social change isnt all or nothing) 
the veil itself isnt a symbol of womens oppression  in fact, many women experience  
it as just the opposite!  they pity the western woman objectif ied as sex symbol by strange men 
 
GROUPS: brainstorm patriarchal bargains in ot her readings, in the US historically or  
today 
 
strategic use of gender-typed qualities th at might give women short-term gains 
but long-term, could reinforce subordination? 
  Abu-Lughod   the romance of resistance  picks up where Kandiyoti leaves off  
 
inverting Foucault: where there is resistance, there is power 
resistance against social power (incl uding male dominance) can tell us about how power 
works 
  Bedouin of Egypt? what traditional everyda y womens resistances does she describe? 
 women cover for other women (secrets, silences) 
resistance to arranged marriages 
 sexually irreverent discourse  poking fun at male prestige through belittling  
manhood, sexual basis of male dominance 
 oral poetry that conveys the sentiments that violate sexual codes of modesty   
romantic love 
 but, again, times are changing  poetry is bein g recorded almost exclusively by men;  
as the Bedouin are more sedentary, theyre more dependent on cash income and  consumer goods 
how are women accommodating male dominance w ithin a new consumer society, when  
they are losing occasions for reciting poetry?  
generational resistances: ne gligees, nail polish  to please husbands sexually

context for these articles: schol ars in the 60s and 70s began to look for examples of how 
subordinated groups resist dominant power structures, not necessarily through overt 
rebellion  civil rights move ment in US, peasant uprisings in colonial states  but 
through everyday acts of subordination or a re-interpretation of dominant symbols 
 
ex: queer as appropriated by groups w ho had been stigmatized by this as a 
derogatory label; same with black power  
 
inspired by Michel Foucault: w here there is power, there is  resistance  people arent 
completely bonked over the head by ideology, arent completely passive in their own lives even if  politically and economically subordinated 
 
corrective to some socialist feminist analys es that reduce love to ideology (Rapp?) 
false consciousness 
 not coincidentally, perhaps, both authors writing about women in Muslim Middle East why do you think this might be? why perhaps especially important to rethink womens 
resistance  and how to identify resistance  here? 
  Lets start with Kandiyotis  patriarchal bargain   
what does she mean by this?  Foucault: every form of power and domina tion engenders its own forms of resistance 
  
patriarchy (or better, male dominance) wo rks differently in different places 
womens accommodation to male dominance has thus meant different patriarchal 
bargains  womens agency will look different in different  contexts  isnt necessarily going to be 
about choice (chosen marriage, right to choose abortion, etc.) 
 classic patriarchy (see Ehrenreich &amp; English) = law of fathers for women, what was the classic patriarchal bargain?   exercising power as mothers of sons, rulers of daughters-in-law 
 generational, kin-based power   Ernestine Friedl (1967) (anthropol ogist who worked in rural Greece): 
the appearances of [male] prestige can obs cure the realities of  [female] power 
  
precisely because women have been de nied public prestige, they are free 
to maneouver behind the scenes to  affect outcomes, often through 
manipulating men  what Abu-Lughod calls kin-based power  characterized here as the quintessen tially feminine trait of cunning

          <text>gender, power and agency 
 last time, Weston importantly argued:  
Persons do not possess  gender-typed qualities so much as they use symbols to 
fashion presentations of self  that incorporate gender. 
 And yet, in everyday practice, many jobs ar e strongly associated with either men or 
women  The conceptual links between gendered traits and job requirements are so powerful that 
they can influence what men on the job s ee when they watch a woman work (142) 
 
what women conceive as calculated troubleshooting pro cedure can be otherwise 
read as lack of initiative, natural aptitude, or proper style  womens inability thus becomes self-confirming
 the same can be said of racial stereotypes  Nakano Glenn  history of servitude traded on racist ster eotypes that black women and other women of 
color were incapable of governing their ow n lives and thus were dependent on whites
making white employment of them an act of benevolence (444)   but lot of work
 went into to fabricating appearance of dependency  such as? 
  calling domestics by first name, or Anglicizing name, or using generic Maria 
 giving domestics family cast-of clothes, leftover food 
 using back door  Yet, at the same time, women and men also make use of gendered stereotypes in ways 
that can enhance their positions.  Q: To what extent does the strategic use of gendered stereotypes reproduce structural 
inequalities, symbolic basis of womens subordination, limits on choice for both women 
and men? To what extent does the strategi c use of gendered stereotypes lead to the 
exercise of individual ch oice, personal agency? 
 this brings us to a key debate in social theory over the relationship between social 
STRUCTURE and individual AGENCY  to what extent are our actions determined by social norms, peer pressure, institutional 
constraints (e.g., even in societies that value achieved status, the status of the family one 
is born into still matters)  Abu-Lughod and Kandiyoti  rethinking th e relationship between power (male 
dominance) and resistance (womens agency)

          <text>control and the self 
 weve been talking about how gender-typed qualities  reckless courage, multitasking, nurturance, etc.  are not innate  to women and men, but ne ither are they merely learned 
by women and men (acquired through socialization)  they ar e also strategically USED 
by women and men.  moreover, people use gender-typed qualities in ways that both conform  to dominant 
expectations (making them appear self-evident) and that challenge  dominant expectations 
 what we see here is a tension between accommodation and resistance 
between internalization of norms and misidentification of norms (seeing norms  and not a counter reality)  
therefore, individual acts of resistance can turn out to reproduce old structures of 
dominance, or even produce new ones  Bedouin women buying negligees 
  what people themselves think isnt the end of the story of social analysis 
 
 1st Q: How is it that ideology works so well?  how do people internalize as common sense the assumptions, stereotypes, values that 
underwrite social inequality, including gender inequality, racial and class inequality  
and, how are some people able to resist or retool common sense assumptions?  
why is it that women often contribute to thei r own symbolic and material subordination? 
and sometimes even find pleasure and pride in those things  the fashion magazines, the 
dieting, double day of housework done fo r love on top of ones real job? 
 initial thoughts at this point?  todays readings address these quest ions through the topic of food, eating 
 the aphorism, you are wh at you eat is really a metaphysical  truism  not just that our 
bodies are shaped, in part, nutritionall y, but that our eating philosophies embody 
particular notions of selfhood  a notion of SUBJECTIVITY 
  what do we mean by subjectivity?   how one sees oneself as an indivi dual, within a community of others 
   Colliers article traces a shift in subjectivity  from viewing success as a  
matter of inheritance (ascribed status) to personal achievement 
  its a shift in conceptualizations of selfhood, human potentiality, giving  
meaning to ones actions

          <text>so, for Maude, extreme weight loss didnt reflect distorted body image (didnt see 
herself, or fear herself, as  fat), but an endless form  of body work that displayed 
achievement 
 achievement for women about self-c ontrol, not power; do you agree? 
 Bodies are imagined as resources for fitne ss and health, and the fit body is an icon for 
achieving individualism, productivity, and sel f-actualization within late capitalist 
consumer culture in the contemporary United States (385)  Gremillions thesis: anorexia is not so mu ch a pathology, but logical conclusion of 
dominant cultural values  extreme res ponse to embodying contradictory messages of 
feminine fitness  meaning both physical fitness and social/moral fitness  understand? what do you think?  relationship b/w consumption and production?   would you agree that this is a particular problem for women? 
 now, Gremillion goes further to argue that psychiatric treatment  of anorexia contributes 
to the anorexic subjectivity  sense of se lf  because it operates within the same 
cultural logics that produce anorexia in the first place  HOW? examples   
repercussions for emphasis on achieved status : we  particularly girls/women  both 
ARE our bodies (objectified as numbers, body parts, sensuality, reproductive capacity) 
and must continually WORK ON our bodies (to demonstrate control, status, demonstrate fitness for masculine workplace)   So, were at the end of the first thema tic section of class  gender and labor 
 not only have we looked at the importance of gender in the workplace,  in negotiating paid 
and unpaid labor in the domestic sphere  weve also talked a bout how, in a capitalist 
market-based society where status is imag ined as being based on personal achievement, 
theres a lot of work that goes into achieving what I call in my book gender proficiency 
 to produce gender-appropriate bodi es, cultivate gendered subjectivities 
 NEXT TIME well begin adding to this discussion the very crucial element of sexuality  beginning with the history of the very id ea of sexual orientation, or sexuality-based 
identity  important readings   how does sexuality complicate gender, and vice versa?

what kind of subjectivity does Counihan see American college students enacting through their food rules?    we embody the principle of achieved status  through our relationship to food 
  thin = self-control, moral superiority   higher social status (and economic) 
 fat = lack of self-control, lack of pride,  moral inferiority  lower socioecon status 
 eating is a way of incorp orating cultural values 
 are these shared values gendered ? do they play out differe ntly to produce gender? 
 
not that all men/wome n eat differently, but styles of eating  are gendered 
 do we see a tension here b/w agency and subordination/power and resistance? 
 
Gremillion: slender, fit body = autonomy and success for women, it also implies 
dependence on others approval (p erhaps especially mens) 
 
Counihan: practices th at contribute to wome ns subordination as a whole 
(emphasis on attractiveness to men rather than, say, strength) can ALSO provide individual  women with measure of power with in status quo  patriarchal bargain 
 
 it also sorts out a hierarchy among women and girls 
 
the article on anorexia demonstrates the lo gical conclusion of the values, cultural ideas 
embedded in our food rules 
 
Helen Gremillion

patients come from the same demogr aphic pool as Counihans students) 
 
lets start with the story of 16 year-old Maude  exaggerated version of the discourse of 
Counihans students:  Maude talked to me about the link b/w we ight loss and her creation of a unique and 
independent identity, which she equated with her ability to achiev e (in school and in 
other activities). For Maude, losi ng weight was no effort at a ll. But the effort it took to 
keep up with all her activiti es at increasingly lower weights balanced out the ease of 
losing weight Maude implied that she kept lo sing weight so that she could continually 
test her ability to achieve. But, at the same time, she said that this balancing act was no 
big deal. It was impor tant to Maude that her achievements felt nat ural to her identity , not 
like a test. (397)

 Personal Origin Stories  the stories they tell about themselves to explain who they are  what is a common narrative among the jotas ? 
  innate tendencies  dolls, dressing in mothers clothes, fascinated by  
penises 
  early sexual abuse (age 6-8), possibl y triggered when adults recognized  
their homosexual or feminine tendencies; discovery: liked it 
 how might we unders tand, interpret this? 
   
patriarchal bargain?  classic patriarchy = law of fath ers (manliness often = abuse) 
 see Martas story  what can we discern about the cultural c ontext in which this story makes sense? 
 ideology that all men are potentially homosexual  indeed, percentage of Mexican men who have sexual experiences with other men is significant, probably well over 50% 
notion that if they try passive  role they might like it, and th en theyd have to come to 
terms (according to jotas) with this self-re alization  tortillas who deny taking passive 
role are repressed homosexuals  jotas ar e essentializing this identity based on 
pleasure/practice  not so much a matter of choice or preference, but born that way 
 do mayates confirm this? 
no  more constructivist view  fear that they may learn that they like it (not 
inevitable) 
 whats particularly problematic for the mayates  about this? why the apparent denial of 
passive pleasure among the tortillas ?  
  homosexual desire (def ined as passive) = feminine gender characteristics  
 homosexuality is strongly linked with emasculination, not being a man  active bisexuality (penetrating men) not ma rked as homosexual but also is not  
an open identity  neither accepted nor stigmatized, but hidden 
 not closeted because not attached to inner sense of authentic self 
 in Mexico, dont have (or only among mi ddle classes) machos who prefer sex  
with men exclusively and claim ho mosexual identity (gay)  no popular

          <text>Annick Prieurs Memas House  
 
an ethnography of contemporary Mexico City   first, aside from my book, th is is only full-scale ethnogr aphy were reading; its 
an example of the kind of study that is behind many of the articles were reading  so its worth talking a bit about what it is that anthropologists do  research 
methodologies what is the sense that you get from Prieur?  
participant-observation  not quantitative studies, but qualitative sense of how 
people think about what they do  thick description (from Clifford Geer tz) = observations plus multiple meanings 
held by those observed plus meanings discerned by the anthropologist within theoretical and comparativ e context  doing a cultural reading of multiple 
meanings, where those meanings come from, and what implications they have for behavior.  any impact on research the fact that Prieur is a woman?   
 in Mexico City, what is sexual identity based on? what sexualit y-based identities are 
meaningful?  active/passive position  + gender  performativity, the projection of gendered codes 
 how does this case complicate American notion of sexual identity?  preferring men has different meaning, different implications for  
identity appearance gender system  
 Prieur addresses the common question: What causes homosexuality ? 
 Q: what do you make of this question itself? useful? what does it assume? 
 is the homosexuality/desire of jo tas same as that of mayates? 
is the homosexuality/desire the same betw een lower and middle class men in Mexico? 
 whats interesting anthr opologically is how people themselves, in different cultural 
settings, construe identities based on sexuality, gender, race (which we know 
scientifically is not a valid categor y of biological differentiation), etc.

          <text>easier for families to accept homosexual tendencies than feminine presentation  WHY? 
  weve been talking about gender  what it m eans to be proper man/woman, whats read 
as masculinity/femininity  but what about patriarchy ? male domination (as Prieur 
says)?  by being improper men in displaying passive  femininity, reinfor ces idea that proper 
masculinity is active, aggressive, do minant  exception proves the rule 
 
in reducing femininity to sexual passivit y, ideology perpetuates male dominant 
view of proper womanhood; but this is reductive, fictional  womens 
subjectivities are not reduced to passive sexuality 
 however much jotas make of their feminine gender identity, Annick Prieur demonstrates 
through ethnographic observation that their gend ering is more complicated than their own 
depictions suggest  HOW?   theyre not women (can lead to health pr oblems, violence, disillusionment) 
  theyre not entirely not masculine  examples of how they operate in the world  
in ways that are coded masculine?  
physical toughness, fist fights competitiveness (whose breasts bigger, better, etc.) 
 what does femininity boil down to for them? passive role in sex, ability to attract  
manly men  exaggerated feminine app earance  not just feminine signs, but 
feminine signs of s exual availability   far from a femini st understanding! 
 embrace certain aspects of feminine suffe ring  for beauty, if not for children 
physical fighting, masculine competitiveness, messiness 
  gender is not straightforward matter of personal choice (class makes a difference) 
 vestitas, in fetishizing or parodying feminine sexuality, can be seen more to reinforce  
dominant gender stereotypes (dualistic  model) than to challenge them

          <text>sexual violence (including thinking se xual abuse of males)  
 
rape in/after American slavery 
 
  what did you make of Di Leonardos essay? 
 cant analyze away our subjective experience  knowledge does not necessarily command emotion  fear is shaped by cultural forces  myths,  stereotypes  we dont always have  
analytical command over  or at least not until after the fact of initial flood of  adreinaline 
 conversely, individual experiences shouldnt change well-thought- out-opinions  at 
least not necessarily   like Foucault refusing to theorize  from his personal belief about 
the source of homosexual desire in individuals   pitfalls of identity politics,  appropriateness of speaking from experience 
 how should we move back and forth between  social science analysis and personal 
experience? when is one relevant to  the other?  (pedagogical challenge) 
 importance of attending to  personal experience  
importance of not eliding personal experience and social analysis

          <text>sexual violence 
 lets start with article by Lo ri Heise, who is writing about  the pervasiveness of sexual 
violence against women and child ren, gender-based violence 
 first, she argues for the importance  of statistical research, ma king visible such incidences 
and it is endemic  especially wife abuse/pa rtner abuse (also incest, child sexual abuse) 
 b/w 1-5 to 1-7 women in US will be subject to complete rape in lifetime   obviously begging Q of definition  but still!   repercussions for family pl anning/contraceptive promotion 
 HIV-AIDS prevention  
 when condoms are targeted at women, ofte n assumed their choice to insist men 
use them, BUT  Greece and elsewhere, condoms  old technology  associated w/ prostitution and extramarital affairs: to insist on a man using them w/in marriage is read as 
either questioning his fidelity or ackno wledging womans infidelity (why else 
need for safe sex in marriage?)  often le ads to violence, but even the perception 
of threat  of violence has kept women from raising issue w/husbands. [more later] 
 that said, Heise acknowledges hazards  of exposing the reality of violence, the  
pervasiveness of gender-based sexual violence  what are these? (p. 423) 
 
1) promoting image of victimization of wome n; all sex bad, no pleasure (esp. for women) 
 woman as passive 
 2) feeds essentializing sterotypes men=aggressive  
if universal, then biologically based = natural =  good or, at least,  
inevitable (more on that later)  
Q: her strategy in response?  
the anthropological veto (Peggy Sanday) 
 but are there flaws with this strategy?   flaw: anthro veto (LIKE universalist claims) assumes that sexual violence is something that could be located in any so ciety  that is, its not cultur e bound (after all, isnt it all 
over the place?)  Q: are there alternative arguments? what mi ght be a better response to the hazards?

          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>ask: are these characterizations of violence actually the same thing everywhere? 
 
1st, think about the question,  why does violence (in general) occur? 
myriad of reasons  revenge, fear, hatre d, misunderstanding, marking difference, 
conquest, political ends, material gain  why does sexual  violence  occur? 
its striking how many theories focus on a single  cause, assume universality of 
occurrence and meaning  
ex: its a natural outcome of male sexuality [active, aggressive] (e.g., A Natural 
History of Rape: The Biologica l Basis of Sexual Coersion  = men rape when the 
costs are low and they can get away with  it b/c its a byproduct of evolutionary 
biology and reproductive success)   note: so much of technology, social p rogress is direct ed at modifying, 
controlling nature, its inte resting that nature seem s suddenly uncontrollable 
when it comes to socially contentious issues  
 flip side: 
constructivist argument: its a political outcome of so cially constructed male se xuality (men rape because 
they are taught they are naturally aggressive, it bolsters their masculinity)  thus Heise: it is partly mens insecur ity about their masculinity that promotes 
abusive behavior towards women  
 
feminist activist mantra: rape isnt about sex, its about power  
 what do you make of this position, Heis es analysis generally? criticisms? 
 
overgeneralizations may undermine political -moral efforts to eradicate violence 
 
a better way to think about the pervasivene ss of sexual violence might be to look at 
 HISTORY and cultural context  
militarized mass rape 
 
 gender-based violence is also often race/ethnicity-based or religion-based  rape, as di Leonardo points out, is rarely if ever just an act between a man (generically 
speaking) and a woman (generically speaking)  but b/w white man and black woman, or Serb man and Croat woman  specificity is important 
 
reducing rape to something boils down to man v. woman has hampered theorizing
