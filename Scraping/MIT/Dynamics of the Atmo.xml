11.1 Shallow water equations 
When considering the general problem of linearized oscillations in a static, 
arbitrarily stratied atmosphere(oroceanforthat matter),we ndthatthere 
isseparability oflatitudeand altitudedependence(inspherical coordinates). 
Forsimplicityinwhatfollowswewillconsidera  planeinsteadof aspherical 
surface. As on a sphere, our equations naturally divide into two sets. 
The rst set consists in the following three equations: 
iunfv= ik
n (11.1) n 

ivn+ fun= y n (11.2) 
and 
vni iku
n + y = ghn

Hu + z 0, x t =0. Under these circumstances there is no further need for 
the vertical structure equation. What our analysis shows is that the shallow 
water equations are always appropriate to hydrostatic oscillations on a static 
basic state  subject to the reinterpretation of h. Our analysis, therefore, 
servestojustify andgeneralizethe use ofthe shallow water equations. 
The shallow water equations are used as model equations in both me
teorology and oceanography. In most applications they are not considered 
approximations. We shall make extensive use of these equations in the fol
lowing two subsections where we investigate the eects of f, the Coriolis 
parameter, varying with y. 
Itshouldberemembered,however,that onceweobtainarelationamong 
frequency, horizontal wavenumbers, and the depth of the shallow water, we 
arealwaysfreetoreinterpretthedepth asanequivalentdepth and tosolve 
for the depth in terms of the other parameters in order to apply the results 
to problems of forced rather than free oscillations. 
11.2 Rossby waves 
When f is constant and (11.1)(11.3) are applied to a channel geometry, 
they describe easterly and westerly gravity waves modied by rotation. We 
will now allow f to vary in the same way that density varies in a Boussinesq 
uid; that is, we will take f to be constant unless it is dierentiated  in 
which case we will take df =  = constant. This is known as the -plane dy 
approximationandis,infact,duetoRossby. Rossbyintuitivelyrealizedthat 
forlarge-scalemeteorologicalsystemsthe rst modicationonaspheretothe 
f-plane equations arises from the variation of f withlatitude. Subsequently, 
scaling analysishasbeenused to more rigorouslyjustify thisapproximation. 
Our startingpoint willbe(11.1)(11.3). With variable f, it will prove 
moreconvenienttoreduce(11.1)-(11.3) toasingleequationin vratherthan

u between(11.1) and(11.2) weget

observations. 
(iii)ThevelocityeldsassociatedwithRossby wavesarealmostingeostrophic 
balance.Nonetheless,theoutright assumptionofgeostrophy would not 
permit us to evaluate the time evolution of Rossby waves. The devel
opment of an appropriate approximate set of equations which exploit 
geostrophy but still describe Rossby waves will be one of our tasks. 
(iv) The dispersive properties of Rossby waves clearly suggests that it is 
Rossby waves and not gravity waves which describe large-scale meteo
rological systems. 
11.3	Remark on Kelvin waves: The case of 
v0.
The solutions in Section 2 assume v =0. We here consider the situation 
where v 0. There exists a solution in this case known as a Kelvin wave. 
As an exercise you will derive the properties of Kelvin waves on what is 
known as an equatorial  -plane(where f = y). Here we will take f = f0.

frequency rather than h is the eigenvalue. The resulting modes are known 
as free oscillations. 
It mustbe emphasized thatthe eigenfunctions of(11.6) do not,ingen
eral, form a complete set. For example, for a semi-innite atmosphere with 
anisothermalbasic statethereexistsasingleequivalentdepthforthe atmo

so called baroclinic modes are usually artifacts resulting from the articial 
presence of a reecting lid. In general, 
h = H. (11.10) 
We have also shown that for a shallow uid with a free surface and N2 =0 
(i.e., dH + H 0) there is also a single equivalent depth dz

Underthelattercircumstances,(11.1)(11.3) areknownasthe shallow water

independent of z, and  is just gsurface displacement. Equation 11.3 
can then be directly interpreted as the continuity equation. This is readily 
seen if we ignore y-variation. Referring to Figure 11.1 we see that as x</text>

notedby Charney andDrazin(1961).

Let us now returntofree oscillations. Rewriting(11.16) weget

Equation 11.20 is cubic in . We may anticipate that the three roots will 
correspond to two gravity waves and a Rossby wave. In general, gravity 
wavefrequencies(forpositive h)will exceed f sotheterm k will be negli 
gible. Similarly, for Rossby waves 2 f2 . Thus(11.20) has thefollowing 
approximate solutions:

and
k f2 n 2 
= + k2 + gh d 
or 
k  = . (11.22)

In contrast to gravity waves, which can have easterly and westerly phase 
speeds, Rossby waves always have easterly phase speed (relative to U0). 
Eastwest asymmetry is always a characteristic of motions for which  is 
important. 
Severalproperties of(11.22) are worth noting: 
(i)  has a maximum value for a particular value of k (which you will 
work out as an exercise). Pedlosky(1979) has an elegant explanation 
of this which we shallgo overas soon as wedevelop sometheoremson 
vorticity conservation.</text>

These notes end(asdo many courses) rather abruptly. Ihope toleavethe 
reader with the sense that he or she has learned a lot. But, I would hardly 
wish to disguise the fact that we have barely begun the exploration of at
mospheric dynamics. The nonlinear evolution and possible equilibration of 
instabilitieswhichshouldgiveusthewaveand uxmagnitudeshasonlybeen 
touched on  both in these notes and in current research. A major current 
approach to questions of the general circulation  namely, the use of large 
numerical computersimulations hasnotevenbeendiscussed. Areaswhose 
impact on large-scale dynamics is almost certainly major  like boundary 
layerturbulenceand convectivecloud activity havelikewisebeenonlype

Wholebooks(inmost casesseveral) and countlessarticleshavebeendevoted

a high degree of specialization. Certainly the individual problems are great

10.2.2 Conditions for absorption 
For z &gt; 0,(10.27) becomes 
w= z1/2 eiln z  . (10.28) 
Equation 10.28 has a branch point at z =0. In continuing z to negative 
values, (10.28) does not lead to a unique answer. The answer depends on 
whether we pass above or below z =0 in traversing the complex z-plane2 . 
Now, had we retained damping 
a ik(c U0) ik(c U0)+
= ik(ai dU0 z).dzk 
2For those who dont remember what a branch point is, here are a few explanatory 
remarks. 
Consider z  in the complex plane 
We may write z  =|z  |ei . Then 
lnz  = ln(z  ei) ||
= lnz  +lnei |
|
= lnz + i. ||
Now,  in the above diagram is arbitrary to a positive or negative multiple of 2. The 
choice of branch is tantamount to the choice of the appropriate 2 rangefor . If we are 
moving across the origin along the real axis, we must, in this connection, decide whether 
 is going from 0 on the positive side to  on the negative side or from 0 on the positive 
sideto  on the negative side. The former corresponds to passing above the origin; the 
latter to passing below the origin.</text>

addition to propagation. (N.B. we have decay because of our choice of a

Howthesemattersactuallywork outisstill amatterof somecontroversy. 
For a problem we will soon look at, the gravity wave periods will be rather

Other cases are not so clear. Benney andBergeron(1969) have shownthat 
the nonlinear limit leads to reection rather than absorption at the critical 
level.However,thenonlinearsolutionisunstableand mayleadtoturbulence 
which in turn may lead to absorption again. 
10.3.1	Violation of the second Eliassen-Palm

We now come to an obvious  but major  point. When we have damping, 
the second Eliassen-Palm theorem is violated. Instead, we have

worth noting thatinthepresenceof rotation,theresponseof uisnolongerso

and the change in u might be negligible.) This mechanism is believed to 
play a major role in generating the quasi-biennial oscillation of the tropical

The non-dimensional number, Ri, is known as the RichardsonNumber.The 
nature of our solution will depend greatly on whether Ri&lt;1/4. Now Ri is &gt; 
a measure ofhow rapidly(c U0) is varying and for WKBJ theory to be 
appropriate we would want Ri &gt; 1/4. In the atmosphere Ri is typically 
110. Inthis case(10.24) becomes

Not surprisingly z 
NL depends on the wave amplitude. Now nonlinear prob
lems are generally dicult. Can damping help us avoid these diculties 
(and, at the same time, preserve our earlier linear results on what happens 
at a critical level). 
If we keep the linear damping shown in Equations 10.1 and 10.4, it is 
equivalent to replacing ik(U0 c)with ik(U0 c)+a, or replacing(c U0) 
with(c U0)+ai . Damping will begin to dominate when k

Thus, while w and go to zero as c U0 0,u and T  blow up. Is this 
consistent with the second Eliassen-Palm theorem? 
p0 1 0uw = uw
   gH 2|||| 
p0=0gH 
since(10.19) and(10.2) imply uand w areinphase, and  1  
0  sin2 d = 21 . 
From(10.19) and(10.20) wehave 
 
z0uw = p0(0)ez 1Ae /2 AHez /2 
gH 2 k  
1A2 
= p0(0)= constant. 2gk 
The answer, therefore, is yes. It is interesting to note that the factor 1/2 
in Equation 10.11 is crucial in this regard. The momentum ux 0uw is 
actuallytheWronskianof thewaveequation,and thefactor 1/2 guarantees 
that the Wronskian of the WBKJ solution remains constant. 
10.2 Critical level behavior 
We may next ask what happens when c U0 actually goes through zero. 
Clearly something must happen. Eliassen and Palms rst theorem tells us 
that if a wave travels through a critical layer, 0uw must change sign. This 
implies an exchange of momentum ux carried by the wave with the mean 
ow at the critical level. The only possible alternative is that the wave is 
totally reected atthe criticallevel,in which case pw= 0uw=0. 
An answer, for linear theory in the limit of vanishing damping, was 
obtainedbyBooker andBretherton(1967). Let z = 0 be the critical level 
andlet 
dU0U0 = c + z 
dz 
in the neighbourhood of z =0. Equation10.9becomes</text>

asgiven. 
Figure10.1 schematicallyillustrateshowa uid atrest(initially) might 
respond to a wave with phase speed c =1.uis accelerated towards 1, 
but note that as u is brought towards 1 in the lower part of the domain, i 
must increase and this prevents the wave from acting on the upper part of 
the domain. In the calculations upon which Figure 10.1 is based, diusion 
eventually carries momentum upward. By the time a sharp shear zone devel
opsnearthebottom,the uid abovethisshearzoneispretty muchisolated 
from the westerly wave. If, however, there were also an easterly wave with 
c = 1,itwouldbefreetopropagateupward accelerating utowards 1. The 
downwarddescent of theeasterly shear zone(ontop of thepreviouswesterly 
shear zone) wouldproduceseverestresseswhich would wipeoutthewesterly 
zone and allow the westerly waves to propagate upward again starting the 
whole process anew. Of course, the actual calculations have some nuances 
which are here omitted. But, the essential mechanism is as described. In 
particular, the amplitude of the oscillation in u is determined by the phase 
speeds of the upward propagating waves, and the period of the oscillation in 
uisdeterminedby the averageintensity of the upward propagating waves. 
Thismechanismwas rstdescribedby LindzenandHolton(1968),and 
brought to its current form by Lindzen (1971) and Holton and Lindzen 
(1972). A highly simplied version of the theory appropriate to a labora
tory conguration wasdevelopedby Plumb(1977) andthe mechanismhas, 
infact,been simulatedinthelaboratoryby Plumb andMcEwan(1978).</text>

So with damping the branch point moves above z = 0, and hence in going 
frompositiveto negative z wepassbelowthebranchpoint; thatis, z goes 
to |z|ei, and(10.28) goesto 
w = iz1/2 ei(ln|z  |i) = iz1/2 eeiln|z  |. (10.29) || ||
Itis easily shownfrom(10.28) and(10.29) thatif 0uw= A below z =0, 
it will equal Ae2 above. For Ri &gt; 1, this implies almost complete wave 
absorption atthecriticallevel.Thisisconsistent with ourearlierobservation 
that group velocity 0 as c U0 0, thus allowing any damping enough  
time to act. 
10.2.3 Linear and nonlinear limits

10.4 Quasi-biennial oscillation 
Let us briey recall what this phenomenon is. Its main features are shown 
in Figure 5.17. Easterly and westerly regimes in the equatorial stratosphere 
(of magnitude 20 m/s) alternate quasi-periodically with an average period 
of about twenty six months. There is also an apparent downward phase 
propagation. Now, how do gravity waves enter this picture? Remember, for 
vertical propagation to be possible gravity waves must have periods short 
compared to the pendulum day. For most of the earth this means periods 
shorter than a day or so, and from what we saw in Chapter 5, most eddy 
energy is at periods longer than this. So, over most of the earth we do not 
anticipatethatthebulk of theeddieswillbehaveasgravity waves. However, 
as we approach the equator, the pendulum day goes to innity, and the 
energy in these long periods can begin to propagate vertically as internal 
gravity waves. Also, theCoriolistermlegitimately drops out of(10.35). It 
is,infact,observedthat such wavesareproducedintheneighbourhood of the 
equator withboth easterly and westerlyphasespeeds. Theexact natureof 
their excitation is not yet fully understood, but it appears to originate near 
thetropical tropopause(ca. 16 km). Let us take the existence of such waves</text>

and the+ signisappropriatetoupwardpropagation(showthisforyourself). 
Notethat(10.27) is essentially ourWKBJ solutioninthe neighbourhood of 
z = 0. Note also that this is very denitely not the case when Ri &lt; 1/4! 
(Itisnotirrelevantto notethat whenRi &lt; 1/4 the uid can be and often is 
unstable; i.e., waves draw energy from the basic state.)</text>

Equation 13.78 suggests that a minimum shear is needed for instability 
whereasSubsection13.3.1 suggested thatinstability could existforanynite

suggest that baroclinic instability acts as a temperature regulator for the 
whole system  contributing only what is needed, in addition to the contri
butions of other processes to the heat ux, to achieve baroclinic neutrality. 
This suggeststhatthe climateislargely determinedbyprocesses which mix 
potential vorticity  among which processes baroclinic instability is a major 
contributor. These ideas are still in a rather preliminary and controversial 
stage,but supportforthemexistsinnumerical experimentswithgeneral cir
culationmodels(Manabe andStrickler,1965;Manabe andTerpstra,1974; 
and others) which show that the total equatorpole heat ux is not particu
larlysensitivetotheinclusionof mountains,hydrology,and soforth though 
the makeup of the heat ux, naturally enough, is. At the heart of the above 
problem is the nonlinear evolution of the instabilities we have touched on in 
this chapter. 
13.7 Geometric stabilization 
Before ending this chapter, it may be worth noting that the condition for 
baroclinicneutralityisnottheonlypossible condition. BothEquation13.77 
andFigure13.3 suggest an alternativeapproach tostabilization. Figure13.3 
clearly showstheexistenceof a short-wave cutoforbaroclinicinstabilityin 
a 2-level model. Instability disappears if 
k22 
&gt; 1. 2 
Now, if our uid is conned within a channel of width L, then we will have 
a meridional wavenumber, , in addition to the zonal wavenumber, k.Thus, 
k in the above equation, must be replaced by the total wavenumber, K = 
(k2 + 2)1/2, and the above condition becomes 
K22

Moreover,  /L, and, hence,

course, it may seem fraudulent to use quasi-geostrophic equations to derive 
Rayleighs theorem  but actually its okay. Why?) 
The extension of qin(13.46) is reasonablein view ofthe equivalenceof 
the following situations: 
(i) letting 
z uat z =0 be equal to 
z uat z =0+, and 
(ii) letting 
z u=0 at z = 0 and having a -function contribution to

z =0 at z =0. 
In the second case, q asdenedby(13.46) is actually q, the basic pseudo-
potential vorticity. In many cases of practical interest, uz &gt; 0 and the 
curvature terms in (13.35) are relatively small above the ground, so that 
qy &gt; 0 in the bulk of the atmosphere. However, the -function contribution 
to 
z2u 
2 makes qy &lt; 0at z =0+. Thus the surface at which qy changes sign is 
just at the ground. 
The condition we have derived is only a necessary condition for insta
bility, but, in practice, when it is satised we generally do nd instability. 
However, there are important exceptions.

13.1 Remarks 
Inthepreviouschapters,weexaminedthewavepropertiesof theatmosphere 
under a variety of circumstances. We have also considered the interactions 
of waveswith mean ows. WithinGeneralCirculationTheory,itisgenerally 
held that eddieshavetobeinvolvedintransporting heatbetweenthetropics 
andthepoles. Thusfarourstudyof waveshasnotprovided muchinsightinto 
thismatter. Asitturns out, verticallypropagating stationary Rossby waves 
docarryheatpoleward. Thisheattransport,whilenotinsignicant,islargely 
a byproduct of the fact that the wave momentum ux acts to reduce shears, 
and geostrophic adjustment involves a concomitant reduction of meridional 
temperature gradients. Unfortunately, we will not have time to study these 
mechanisms in these notes. However, the quasi-geostrophic framework es
tablished in Chapter 5 greatly simplies such studies. This framework will 
be used to study how travelling disturbances arise in the atmosphere. We 
will alsosketch someresultswhich suggestthatthesetravellingdisturbances

generation of such disturbances involves hydrodynamic instability, and be
foredivingintothisproblemin a meteorological context,it willbe useful to 
examine stability in simpler situations. 
Beforebeginningthistopicweshould recallpossiblewave(eddy) sources 
considered thusfar: 
1. Direct forcing as produced by tidal heating, ow over mountains, or 
owthroughquasi-stationaryinhomogeneitiesinheating. 
2. Resonant free oscillations. These are presumably preferred responses 
to any noise. However, given the presence of dissipation it is not 
clear what precisely maintains the free Rossby waves observed in the 
atmosphere. Moreover,whentherelativephasespeedsofRossby waves 
become small compared to variations in the mean zonal ow, the free 
Rossby waves cease to exist. Observed free Rossby waves have large 
phase speeds. 
The bulk of the travelling disturbances in the (lower) atmosphere and 
oceans are due to neither of the above, but arise as instabilities on the mean 
ow. 
13.2 Instability 
We shall use the word instability to refer to any situation where a pertur
bation extracts energy from the unperturbed ow. The word energy is 
surrounded by quotes because the concept of energy is not always unam
biguous. Crudely,aninstabilitygrowsattheexpenseofthebasic ow. The 
precise sense in which this is true may have to be elaborated on. 
Thistopichasbeenstudiedforwelloveracentury.Itisstill amajorarea 
of research with many areas of uncertainty and ignorance. In this chapter, 
we can only hope to convey a taste of what is an important, interesting, and 
dicult subject. 
The most commonly studied approach to instability is by way of what 
are called normal mode instabilities. We earlier referred to the solutions 
of the homogeneous perturbation equations as free oscillations. These were 
normal mode solutionsinthe sensethat aninitialperturbation of suchform 
would continue in that form; this would not be true for an arbitrary (or 
non-normal mode) initialperturbation. Inparticularly simplesituations, we</text>

13.10 Some things about energyto think about 
For many people there is something comforting about energetics. Yet as we 
have seen, it is at best a tool to establish consistency rather than causality. 
The problems go further than this. For example, energy is not Galilean 
invariant. Clearly, the kinetic energy depends on the frame of reference in 
which we are measuring velocity. In addition,thequantity in(13.96) whose 
timederivativeisbeingtakenisnotthefull eddy contributiontoenergy. You 
can easilyprove thisforyourself. Take(13.94)(whichisthe total energy), 
and substitute +for . Theeddycontributionsincludecrosstermswhich 
arelinearin  as well asthequadratictermsin(13.96). Tobe sure, these 
linear terms go to zero when averaged over x, but they are nonetheless part 
of the eddy energy, and their presence in some problems can lead to eddy 
energy not being positive-denite. This, in itself, is not as disturbing as it 
might appear at rst sight. For example, when an eddy with a phase speed 
smaller than the mean ow is absorbed and reduces the mean ow speed, 
shouldnt we think of the eddy before it was absorbed as having negative 
energy insofar as its absorption led to the reduction of the mean kinetic 
energy. It should also be clear that this whole process would depend on the</text>

Equations 13.95 and 13.96, together, seem to tell us that the sum of the 
energy in the zonally average ow and the eddies is conserved, and that 
the growth of eddies occurs at the expense of the mean ow through the 
action of horizontal eddy stresses on uy and horizontal eddy heat uxes on 
Ty. Although theseremarksaresubjecttointerpretation(and wewilldiscuss 
themlater) theydoestablish thecriteriafor eddygrowth tobeenergetically 
consistent; in particular they state that the energy of the zonally averaged 
ow can only be tapped if uy = 0 and/or Ty = 0 (in the above quasi-
Boussinesq system). 
It is, however, sometimes concluded that instabilities are caused by uy 
and/or Ty. Thisis not,ingeneral,true. Tobe sure,if uy = Ty =0 there can 
be nounstableeddies. Insuch acase,the necessary conditionforinstablility 
given in Subsection 13.3.1 would not be satised. However, this condition 
can also fail to be satised when uy =0 and/or Ty =0. 
 Equation 13.95 does tell us that a growing eddy will act to reduce Ty 
and uy.The rsttermontherighthand sideof(13.95) iscalled abarotropic 
conversion while the second term is called a baroclinic conversion. Instabili
ties of ows where uy =0arecalled baroclinicinstablilities, whileinstabilities 
where Ty =0(and uz =0) are called barotropicinstabilities. However, as we 
sawinSubsection13.3.1bothinstabilitiesdepend onthemeridionalgradient 
of potential vorticity. 
13.9 Available potential energy 
The quantity available potential energy is at rst sight a bit strange. We 
expect the conservation of kinetic + potential + internal energy. Now the</text>

solved for the frequencies of these oscillations. In the situations we studied 
(U0 = constant) these frequencies were real, but in other situations these 
frequencies can have an imaginary part, i. When the sign of i is such as 
to imply exponential growth in time, the basic state is said to be unstable 
with respect to normal mode perturbations. 
Most of ourattentionwillbedevoted tothesenormal modeinstabilities, 
but you should be aware that these are not the only cases of instability. It 
frequently occurs that arbitrary initial perturbations have algebraic rather 
thanexponentialgrowth. Inadditiondisturbancesmayhaveinitialalgebraic 
growth followed by algebraic decay. Such situations have frequently been 
ignored in the past because of the eventual decay, but clearly temporary 
growthespecially whenrapid maybeof considerablepracticalimportance. 
Theplethora ofpossibilities maybe alittleconfusing,butitisimportantto 
be aware of them. We willpresent examples of non-normal modeinstability 
later in this chapter.

This particular example is chosen as a simple example of the traditional

in the least clear, for example, why changes of potential vorticity gradient 
should lead to instability. This situation is only beginning to be rectied. 
Fortunately,there existsanimportant exampleof a shear amplieddis

(13.52)will have a solution 
(x,y,t)= F (x U(y)t,y); (13.54) 
that is, the original perturbation vorticity is simply carried by the basic

perturbations areobtainedfrom(13.49) and(13.50). The crucialpoint,thus

The situation is not quite so simple as the above suggests. If  =0, 
thenthe continuousproblem(as opposed tothe2-levelproblem) does not 
have a short-wave cuto. The continuous problem is known as the Charney 
Problem(Charney,1947). However,aspecial caseof thecontinuousproblem 
wherein  = 0 or, more generally, qy = 0, and where the uid has an upper 
boundary ata niteheight(knownastheEady Problem(Eady,1947)) does 
have a short-wave cuto. Lorenz (1962), noting the relevance of the Eady 
Problemtobaroclinicinstabilityinarotating annulus,showed that reducing 
the width of the annulus could stabilize the waves. In the Eady Problem, 
instability arises from the delta-function contributions to qy at the top and 
bottomboundaries. 
As it turns out, baroclinic waves in the atmosphere are meridionally 
conned,notonly by the niteextent of theearth,butby thejetlikestruc
ture ofthe meanzonal wind(Ioannou andLindzen,1986,1990). Lindzen 
(1992) has suggested that the atmosphere could be stabilized with respect 
tobaroclinicinstability,whilemaintaining surfacetemperaturegradients,by 
eliminating qy in the bulk of the troposphere while concentrating qy at some 
upper surface whose height is suciently great. This height turns out to 
be of the order of the tropopause. Observations (Hoskins, et al, 1985) do 
indeed suggest that at midlatitudes qy is much smaller in the bulk of the 
troposphere than it is at either the surface or at the tropopause though qy 
in most of the troposphere is still on the order of . The implications of 
geometric stabilization are still being explored. 
13.8	Energetics of meteorological 
disturbances 
Before concluding these notes, it probably behooves us to consider the en
ergetics of meteorological disturbances. Discussions of energetics have been 
a standard component of dynamic meteorology for about 50 years. A con
sideration of energetics does oer some insights into dynamics, but it has 
contributed little to the actual solution of problems, and introduces a cer
tain amount of confusion for reasons we will discuss. 
Consistent with the approximations of Section 13.3 we may write the 
quasi-geostrophic equations of motions as follows:</text>

Suchgrowth timesaresomuch shorterthantypical timescalesformedium 
large scale motions as to imply that convection will prevent N2&lt;0 over the 
longertime scales(atleast abovethe surfaceboundarylayer). Thisprocess 
of convective adjustment is of substantial importance in atmospheric and 
oceanic physics and in modelling. 
A practical application of convection adjustment arises in connection 
with vertically propagating gravity waves. Recall that such waves increase 
in amplitude as ez/2 and also that such waves are approximately solutions 
to the nonlinear equations. Thus at some height the temperature eld asso
ciated with the wave should become statically unstable  but for the onset 
of convection.Theintensity of the convection(turbulence) oughttobepro
portional to the time rate of change in temperature which the wave would 
produce in the absence of turbulence. This mechanism is currently believed 
to account for the turbulence in the mesosphere called for in composition 
calculations.</text>

          <text>269 Generation of eddies by instability 
The radiating gravity waves are a manifestation of the mean ow giving up 
energy to eddies. In that sense, they also constitute a type of instability. 
This becomes clearer if we consider the solution consisting in gravity 
waves radiating away from the shear layer a little further. When waves ra
diate away from a region without any waves approaching that region, we 
have what amounts to an innite reection coecient. This is an extreme 
example of over-reection. Over-reection refers to situations where waves 
are reected with reection coecients that exceed one. You may conrm 
for yourself in the present problem that gravity waves incident on the shear 
layer with phase speeds between U will, in general, be over-reected. Fi
nally, it should be noted that if we had a reecting boundary below and/or 
above the shear layer, then over-reection could lead to growing modes. A 
waveapproaching theshearlayerwouldbeover-reected and returned tothe 
reecting boundary with increased amplitude. Reection at the boundary 
would return the wave to the over-reecting shear layer for further ampli
cation. Such a process could obviously lead to continuous magnication  
providedthat reected and over-reected waves wereinphase so asto avoid 
destructiveinterference.ThisisdescribedindetailinLindzenandRosenthal 
(1976).

underlying full equationforperturbations(i.e.,Equation10.8). Inthe next

It will prove essential to keep in mind the delta function contributions that 
have been eectively disguised in the present treatment.

Energy budgets for the atmosphere and oceans are studied at great

2The procedure consists in averaging Equations 13.83 and 13.84 with respect to x, 
subtracting these averagesfrom(13.83) and(13.84),multiplying theresulting equations 
by ez/H and(f2/N2)ez/Hz , respectively, adding the two resulting equations, and 0 
integrating over the uid volume. The reader should go through the derivation of both 
Equations 13.95 and 13.96.</text>

13.2.4	Reversal of mesopause temperature 
gradient 
Thewavebreakingalsomustleadtothedepositionofthewavesmomentum 
ux in the mean ow. If the waves originate in the troposphere (and thus 
have small values of phase speed c), then the deposition oftheir momentum 
ux will lead to a slowing of mesospheric zonal winds and the reversal of the 
polepoletemperaturegradient as observed atthe mesopause(Why?). 
13.2.5	Kelvin-Helmholtz instability 
This problem consists in the investigation of the free solutions in a stratied

velocityprole: 
u0 = U	for z&gt; 0 
u0 = U for z&lt; 0.	 (13.10) 
Away from z =0, solutions of the form eik(xct) satisfy

|z|. Also,if 
N2 
(u0 c)2 k2 
is positive for either z&gt; 0 or z&lt; 0, we require the appropriate radiation 
condition. 
Thediscontinuityin u0 at z =0 means that we have dierent solutions 
for z&gt; 0 and z&lt; 0. At z = 0 we require continuity of perturbation vertical 
displacement and pressure. It is easy to show that

(13.81). Onthe otherhand,(13.81) overestimates 
 T as one approaches the 
equator. (Indeed(13.81)blows up at  =0.) 
Despite these problems, there are a number of reasons not to become 
discouraged with the suggestion that baroclinic neutrality may be relevant 
to climate: 
(i)Recentnumerical experimentswith anonlineartwo-level model strongly 
suggestthat when T forradiativeequilibriumexceeds T forbaroclinic   
neutrality the system approaches baroclinic neutrality. 
(ii)Inthetropicswe expect T tobedeterminedby theHadley circulation  
 notby baroclinicinstability(viz. (7.35)). 
(iii) Apriori we do not expect the two-level model to be quantitatively 
appropriate to a continuous atmosphere.</text>

Ingeneral,the above solution representsalgebraicdecay with time. Whatis 
happening isillustratedinFigure13.2. 
Phase lines, which are initially vertical, are rotated by the basic shear, 
and this causesthelinesto moveclosertogether. Now vorticityis conserved 
and vorticity is made up of derivatives of velocity. So, as the phase lines 
move closer together, velocity amplitudes must decrease so that the velocity 
derivativeswillstillyieldthesamevorticity.Youmightplausibly wonderwhy 
wearedevoting somuch attentiontoamechanismwhichleadstodecay.But, 
consider next a slightly moregeneralinitialperturbation: 
F (x,y)= A cos(kx)cos(my). (13.61) 
Equation 13.61 may be rewritten: 
A F (x,y)= (cos(kx my)+cos(kx + my)). (13.62) 2
Nowthe rsttermontheright-hand sideof(13.62) correspondsto(13.57) 
begun at some nite positive time, and will therefore decay. However, the 
secondtermcorrespondsto(13.57) begunatsome nitenegativetime(i.e., 
itsphaselines aretilted oppositetothebasic shear), andthis component of 
the initial perturbation will grow with advancing time until the phase lines 
are vertical.Afterthistime,ittoo willdecay; however,for sucientlylarge 
m,thetotalperturbation velocity willgrowinitially(you will calculatehow 
large m mustbeasanexercise),andit maygrowagreatdealbeforeeventual 
decay sets in. 
Thismechanismwas rstdiscoveredbyKelvin(1887);Orr(1907) sug
gested that this mechanism might explain why ows that are stable with 
respect to normal mode instabilities still become turbulent. It has been pe
riodically rediscovered since then  but generally dismissed as less eective 
than exponential growth forever. However, no disturbance really grows 
forever, and if the Orr mechanism leads to enough growth to lead to nonlin
earity itwillbeimportantand the eventualdecay may beirrelevant. Most 
recently,Farrell(1987) hasbeen arguing thattheOrr mechanismisa major</text>

u is specied(viz. Figure 3.6). Each of the four boxes has the same basic 
mass(i.e., p2 = p1 p; p3 = p2 p). At eachinterfacewewill assumethe 
velocity tohaveacharacteristicmagnitude V (at verticalsurfaces) or W (at 
horizontal surfaces). Finally, we assume that each box can be characterized 
by single values of j,(i)j,(i)j, and j, where j =box number(Note, j 
refers to the mean density of air in the jth box,(i)j to the density of the 
ith constituent in the jth box, and(i)j to the photochemical equilibrium 
density of the ith component in the jth box.). This approach is, of course, 
extremely crude,butitis adequateforillustrativepurposes.</text>

3.1 General considerations 
Inthis chapter,weonceagainturntoasimplemodel. However,herewewill 
be closer to an approximation than we were in the previous chapter. The 
model here will provide greater scope to engage in simulating observations. 
It also provides an example of how a model can, indeed, oer insights into 
thephysics. 
Consider a chemical constituent, i, with density i(z,) and a photo
chemical equilibrium distribution i(z,). Let us consider an idealized situ
ation where, in the absence of transport, 
i = (z,)(i(z,)i(z,)), (3.1) t 
where z is altitude and  is latitude. Equation 3.1 may be considered as a 
highly idealized description of ozone.

Equations of motion 
Supplemental reading: 
Holton(1979), chapters2 and3deal with equations, section2.3deals with 
spherical coordinates, section 2.4 deals with scaling, and section 3.1 
deals with pressure coordinates. 
Houghton (1977), Chapter 7 deals with equations, and Section 7.1 deals 
with spherical coordinates. 
Serrin(1959) 
As has been mentioned in the Introduction, it is expected that almost ev
eryone reading theselecture notes(anddespiteTEXication,these are only 
notes) will have already seen a derivation of the equations. I have, there
fore, decided to cover the equations using Serrins somewhat less familiar 
approach. 
6.1	Coordinate systems and 
conservation 
Let x =(x1,x2,x3) be a xed spatial position; this will be referred to as 
an Eulerian coordinate system. Now, at some moment t = 0 lets look at a 
uid and label each particle of the uid X= X(t,x)=(X1,X2,X3), where 
Xit=0 = xi; that is, we label each particle by its position at t = 0; this will |

the same in rotating and non-rotating systems. 
6.7 Spherical coordinates 
We shall not derive the spherical equations here. The task is straightfor
ward. The most direct approach involves transforming our equations into 
vector-invariantform(notethat  not vector-invariant), and then em u  is 
ploying spherical forms for the invariant operations. Here we will merely 
writedown equationsdiscussedinHolton(his section2.3; N.B.Holton uses

Such a redenition leads to non-dimensional parameters which indicate the 
relativeimportance of varioustermsin equations. Some of the morefamous 
non-dimensional numbers, and the physical balances they represent, are

Ro  friction Ekman No.: Ek = Re = 2L2 Coriolis force , 
(where  /). Note that there is little sense in scaling pressure in the 
absence of either data or the size of other numbers. 
The following are some serious problems with scaling: 
1. Northerly, westerly,and vertical scales and velocities are not necessarily 
the same. 
2. Several scales for a single variable may be present in a single problem. 
3. Not all variables are measured. 
Ultimately, scaling actually requires that we already have knowledge of the 
answer! The following sections deal with some specic examples of scaling.</text>

6.10 Geostrophy 
In terms of scaling, one commonly nds that Ro 1 and Ek 1 so that 
pressure gradients primarily balance the Coriolis force. We also saw this 
directlyinthedata. Nevertheless,theexistenceof thisapproximatebalance, 
alone, does not permit us to calculate the time evolution of ow elds. In 
ordertoexploit Ro 1tocalculatethetimeevolutionof almostgeostrophic 
elds we willhavetoperform a more sophisticated scaling analysis(nottoo 
dierent from what we just did in connection with hydrostaticity) which 
leads to what are called the quasi-geostrophic equations. We will defer this 
analysis until a later chapter. 
Before ending this chapter, an important aspect of geostrophic balance 
needs to be mentioned and pondered: namely, in the absence of viscosity, 
thermal conductivity, and x-variation, the following geostrophic ow is an 
exact solution of the nonlinear equations: 
T (y,z) as determined from Q =0; that is, radiative equilibrium; 
p, as determined from hydrostaticity and the gas law; 
u as determined from geostrophy; and 
v = w =0 .

6.9 Hydrostaticity 
As already noted, hydrostaticity is, in general, an approximation. We will 
use scaling toestimatethe conditionsneededforhydrostaticity tobe agood 
approximation. One is tempted to note that g turns out to be much larger 
than any acceleration or stress in Equation 6.20  at least for most meteo
rological and oceanographic systems. Thus, one might argue that the only 
termlefttobalance g is 1 p .This would,however,be apossibly misleading z
statement. To see why, let us write 
p = p0(z)+p(x,y,z,t) 
 = 0(z)+(x,y,z,t). 
Thequantities p0 and 0 representhorizontal and timeaverages; theprimed 
quantitiesrepresentdeviationsfromtheseaverages. Ingeneral,the averaged 
quantitiesdominatetheaboveexpressions;however,forstablestratication3 , 
theaveraged termsarenotdirectlyinvolvedinthedynamics(whichdepends 
ongradientsofpressure,density,etc.). Scaling mustbedone after p0 and 0 
(andT0)have been subtracted from p and  (andT ). The evaluation of the 
term g in Equation 6.20 then requires knowing how  is related to w, and 
soforth. Itisherethat onehastoinvolvetheenergy equationinthescaling, 
and onediscoversthat anecessary conditionforhydrostaticity toholdisthat

time scale). 
Thisismost easily seenforalinearized adiabaticBoussinesquid where

mustbeproportionalto ij;thatis, 
Aij = k(,T )ij, 
and 
K= k(,T )T. (6.9) 
This result is, of course, far more convincingly obtained by kinetic theory 
considerations. 
Following a similarly abstract approach for ij we will assume

Preface 
The following notes have been used in one form or another for over 20 
years. I am making them available as a pdf le in order to better allow 
changes and corrections to be made. Much has changed in 20 years, though 
the basic aspects of dynamics remain basic. That said, dynamics itself has, 
in many places been deemphasized with respect to modeling. This is, in 
my opinion, unfortunate. Dynamics is crucial as a framework for modeling. 
It provides both fundamental insights into otherwise dicult to interpret 
behavior, and, more generally, an interpretive context for modeling. 
Although the notes are meant to be self-contained and introductory, 
many of the topics covered are somewhat advanced for an introductory 
course. Thereareseveralreasonswhytheyhavebeenincluded(andwhy 
other more traditional topics have been neglected). First, I feel that many 
topics are considered advanced or elementary for historical reasons and 
notbecausethey areparticularlydicult oreasy. ThetopicsIhaveincluded 
donot call onespecially advanced mathematical skills(relatively elementary 
familiarity with ordinary and partial dierential equations and fourier series 
is expected); they are, moreover, topics which I believe to be basic to the 
contemporary study of atmosphericdynamics(wave-mean ow interaction, 
for example). Second, this course has, as a prerequisite, 12.800, which cov
ers much of the traditional introductory material. That said, the material 
in these notes is in many instances conceptually demanding, and students 
should not feel discouraged if they have diculty following it. Some topics 
may require considerable eort. 
Becausemost of thestudentshavealreadybeenintroduced totheequa
tions of motion, I have adopted a somewhat unusual approach to the deriva
tion of the equationsinChapter6. Thederivation(which was usedby L.N. 
Howard in his 1960 Woods Hole Lectures on Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
lectures which helped to introduce me to this eld) is, I believe, due to 
Serrin(1958), and,personally,Ihavealwaysfounditthoughtprovoking as 
well as elegant. 
The fact that the equations of motion are not derived until Chapter 6 
isdiscussedinChapter1, theIntroduction. Three ofthe early chapters(2, 
3, and 5) are meant to provide some motivation for the study of dynamics.</text>

Chapter2 oers a simple example of modeling(ofthe role of theice-albedo 
feedback in climate stability) wherein the role of dynamics is crucial but 
where the treatment of the dynamics is via parameterization. Chapter 3 
introduces a very simple model for the distribution of ozone where, again, 
dynamicsplaysaremarkablerole,and wherethisrolecanbeidentied with
out detailed treatment of the dynamics. Chapter 5 deals with observations 
(much too briey). Ultimately, the study of dynamical meteorology has to 
be motivated by observed phenomena. Chapter 4 diers from the other 3 
chapters wehavejustdiscussed. Itintroduces some(essentially static) force 
balances(namely,hydrostaticity andgeostrophy) which are sointrinsicto 
the subject that they are actually needed in order to discuss observations. 
Only after describing the observations are the dynamical equations de
rived. Apart from the above reasons for this ordering, I also feel that it 
serves to emphasize the important fact that atmospheric dynamics is not 
simply the derivation and application of equations. Rather, one should be
gin by thinking about nature itself. Consistent with this attitude, I have at 
twopointsinthesenotes(namely,inChapter7 ontheHadley circulationand 
in Chapter 10 on tides) devoted considerable attention to the history of the 
subject. Hopefully,thiswillgivethestudent someideaof the context within 
which certain questions were asked and certain solutions proposed. Stated 
somewhat dierently, some attempt is made to help the student understand 
why we attempt to solve the problems we do. 
It shouldbestressed thatthisvolumeconsistsinlecturenotesforapar
ticularcourse. As such,thematerial coveredislimitedby thetimeavailable 
for that course; the notes are not meant to be a comprehensive text or ref
erence. Although this version of the notes does not have an index, the table 
of contents is suciently detailed to permit the reader to nd most topics 
quickly. 
Finally,I wish tothank the variousstudents, secretaries,and colleagues 
who have contributed to the preparation of these notes over the years.</text>

Theoreticalwork centered onthesearchfortheatmospheresfreeoscillations. 
FollowingtheterminologyintroducedinSection8.7,Margules(1890) showed 
that an atmosphere with an equivalentdepth of7.85km would,indeed,have 
afreeoscillationof therequiredtype. Theatmospheresequivalentdepthde
pends onitsthermal structure. Inthelatenineteenthcentury,thisstructure 
waslargely unknown. However,bothRayleigh(1890) andMargules(1890, 
1892,1893), using very crude and unrealistic(in viewof todaysknowledge) 
assumptions, concluded that resonance was a possibility. 
Lamb (1910, 1916) investigated the matter more systematically. He 
found that for either an isothermal basic state wherein density variations 
occurisothermally,orforanatmospherewith abasicstatewith anadiabatic 
lapserate,theequivalentdepth wasvery nearly resonant. Lamb alsoshowed 
that whenthebasicstatetemperaturevariedlinearly(but not adiabatically) 
with height, the atmosphere had an innite number of equivalent depths  
thusgreatly increasing thepossibility of resonance. Little note wastaken of 
this result, but another suggestion of Lambs was followed up: namely, his 
suggestion that the solar semidiurnal tide might, in fact, be gravitationally 
forced. His point was that such forcing would require such a degree of reso
nancetoproducetheobservedtidethatit would actuallydistinguishbetween 
thesolarsemidiurnalperiod and thelunarsemidiurnalperiod(12hr26min). 
The possibility of resonant selection is illustrated in Figure 9.4. Lamb, him</text>

on atmospheric oscillations for over a decade. 
The rst major objections to the resonance theory emerged in the af
termath of World War II when captured V2 rockets were used to probe 
the temperature structure of the atmosphere directly. The structure found 
diered from that proposed by Martyn and Pulley6 . In particular, the tem
perature maximumat50km wasmuchcooler(about280K rather than 
350K). In addition, the temperature decline above 50km ended around 
80km, above which thetemperature againincreases,reaching veryhigh val
ues(6001400K) above150km. JacchiaandKopal(1951), using an ana
log computer, investigated the resonance properties of the newly measured 
temperature proles. They concluded that with the measured proles, the 
atmosphere no longer had a second equivalent depth, and that the magni
cation of the solar semidiurnal tide was no longer sucient to account for 
the observed semidiurnal tide on the basis of any realistic combination of 
gravitational excitation and excitation due to the upward diusion of the 
daily variation of surface temperature7 . As we shall see at the end of this 
chapter, Jacchia and Kopal were premature in claiming to have disproven 
the resonance theory; the real problems had not yet been identied. Nev
ertheless, their results were widely perceived as constituting the demise of 
resonancetheory,and thisperceptionfueledthesearchforadditional sources 
ofthermalforcing. 
Although most of the suns radiation is absorbed by the earths surface, 
about10percentis absorbeddirectlyby the atmosphere, and this appeared 
a likely source of excitation8 . Siebert(1961) investigated the eectiveness 
of insolation absorption by water vapor in the troposphere, and found that 
it could account for one-third of the observed semidiurnal surface pressure 
oscillation. This was far more than could be accounted for by gravitational 
excitation or surface heating. Siebert also investigated the eectiveness of 
insolation absorption by ozone in the middle atmosphere. He concluded its 
eect was relatively small. We now know that this last conclusion is wrong. 
6Hereweseeanexampleof acommonphenomenoninmeteorology: namely,datathat 
turns outto notquitebedata. 
7Up to this point, this was the only form of thermal forcing considered. 
8The absorptive properties of the atmosphere were actually suciently well known in 
the 1930s. It is curious that no one looked into their possible role in generating tides. 
Undoubtedly, the fact that the atmospheric sciences are actually a small eld, and tides a 
small subsetof asmalleld,played animportantpart. Inadditionspecializationundeni

Even L2(p)has been isolated. As we can see in Figure 9.10, the amplitude 
of L2(p)is about 1/20 of S2(p).L2(p)alsohas apeculiar seasonal variation, 
which can only be marginally discerned in Figure 9.11. The seasonal vari

(Elford,1959)(35S) showed typical magnitudes of around 20 m sec1 .All 
quantities were subject to large seasonal uctuations and error circles. At 
Adelaide,diurnal oscillationspredominated, whereas atJordellBank semid
iurnal oscillations predominated; at both stations tidal winds appeared to 
exceed other winds. The extensive vertical averaging made it dicult to 
compare these observations with theory. Improvements in meteor radars 
have madeitpossibletodelineatehorizontal winds with vertical resolutions 
of 12 km over the height range 80 to 105 km. Such results are reviewed in 
GlassandSpizzichino(1974). Typicalamplitudesandphasesforsemidiurnal

Between 90 and 130 km (and higher), wind data can be obtained by 
visually tracking luminous vapor trails emitted from rockets. In most cases 
thisispossible onlyintwilight at sunrise and sundown. Hines(1966) used 
such data to form twelve-hour wind dierences, which seemed likely to in
dicate the diurnal contribution to the total wind at dawn at Wallops Island 
(38N).Hinesassumed thatthe average of the windsmeasured twelvehours 
apart would be due to the sum of prevailing and semidiurnal winds. His

itself frequently is subject to substantial uncertainty. We will see examples 
of all these factors in the history of atmospheric tides. 
In contrast to sea tides, which have been known and described for over 
two thousand years, atmospheric tides were not observed until the invention 
ofthebarometerbyTorricelli(ca. 1643)1 . Newton was able to explain the 
dominance of the lunar semidiurnal component of the sea tide. Briey, tidal 
forcingdepends not only ontheaveragegravitationalforceexertedby either 
the sun or moon, but also on the relative variation of this force over the 
diameterof theearth. Thislatterfactorgivesasubstantial advantagetothe 
moon. The dominance of the semidiurnal component arises because, relative 
to the solid earth, the gravitational pull of the sun or moon or any other 
body simultaneously attracts the portion of the uid shell directly under it 
and repels that portion of the envelope opposite it. From the perspective of 
the earth, both represent outward forces. (viz Figure 9.1. Thus, in a single

9.3.6 Lunar semidiurnal tide 
Finally, we turn briey to the lunar tide L2(ps). Its Hough functions are 
muchlikethosefor S2. The equivalent depth of its main mode is 7.07 km. 
Recall that for an isothermal basic state the atmosphere has a single equiv
alentdepth, h = H 11 km, which is far from resonance for the main 
semidiurnal modes. However, for h 7 km we see from Equation 9.23, the 
vertical structureequation,thatthelocal vertical wavenumberhoversaround 
zero, and varies with height; there is a turning point near 60 km. Thus, as 
we noted, additional equivalent depths might exist and resonance might be 
possible (remember the behaviour of a uid with a lid). This possibility 
has, in fact, been dismissed too casually. Theoretically, one nds that one 
can predict the observed L2(ps)with an isothermal basic state, but Sawada 
(1956) found that for dierent basic T0s, shown in Figure 9.30, responses 
shown in Figure 9.31 were obtained. Such extreme variability is certainly 
characteristicof resonance. Nowtwopoints mustbe made 
(a)No such sensitivity is found for the thermally forced tides; and 
(b)No such extreme variability is observed for L2(ps). So what is happen
ing? First, resonance of an internal wave requires that a wave travel 
up and down at least several times between the ground and a turning 
point in such a manner as to produce coherent interference. This is 
possible for forcing at a single level  but not for a distributed ther
mal excitation. (Think back to the resonance exercises at the end of 
Chapter 8.) Even, however, with forcing at the ground, the surface 
constituting theturningpoint mustbehorizontal. In reality,thebasic 
temperature varies with latitude and coherent reections are dicult 
to achieve. This shows, rather generally, the very unlikely nature of 
internal wave resonance in geophysical systems. A thorough analysis 
of thisisgiveninLindzen andHong(1974). 
However,theproleapproachesasymptoticallyto avery cold constanttemperature above 
the troposphere. This cold temperature leads to m2 being signicantly negative  as op
posed to being almost zero (viz. Equation 9.34). Thus ozone forcing is prevented from 
aecting thesurfacepressure. Butler andSmall(1963) used a realisticprolefor T0 which

self, noted at least two problems with this suggestion. First, of course, was 
the intrinsic unlikelihood of the atmosphere being so highly tuned. The sec
ond reasonwasthatthephaseof theobserved surfacepressuretideled rather 
than lagged the phase of the sun. This was opposite to what calculations 
showed. Chapman (1924) showed that the last item could be remedied if 
thermal forcing was of the same magnitude as gravitational forcing. With 
thisrathercoarse x,theresonancetheory waslargely acceptedforthenext 
eight years. In terms of our discussion of scientic methodology, we were 
still, however, at the stage of simulation rather than theory. This situation 
changed dramatically with the work of Taylor and Pekeris. 
In1932,G.I.Taylornoted(aswesawinSection8.7) that anatmosphere 
with anequivalentdepth h wouldpropagatesmall-scaledisturbances(such as 
would be generated by explosions, earthquakes, etc.) at a speed gh.Using 
data from the Krakatoa eruption of 18834, he showed that the atmospheric 
pulsetravelled at a speed of319ms1, corresponding to h =10.4km  a 
valuetoofarfrom7.85kmtoproduceresonance. In1936,Taylorreturned to 
thisproblem,having rediscoveredLambs earlier resultthatthe atmosphere 
might have several equivalent depths. This allowed some hope for the, by 
now much modied, Kelvin resonance hypothesis. This hope received an 
immenseboostfromthe work ofPekeris(1937). 
Pekeris examined a variety of complicated basic states in order to see 
whatdistributionoftemperaturewould support anequivalentdepth of7.85km5 .

this eect would be inadequate. What really proved to be important was 
that the propagating modes received only 20 percent of the excitation. 
The story of tides hardly ends at this point. New data from the upper 
atmosphere continues to provide challenging questions. Tides still form an 
interesting focus for both observational and theoretical eorts. Still, after a 
century,Kelvinsquestionseemspretty much answered forthemoment. 
9.2 Observations 
Before proceeding to the mathematical theory of atmospheric tides, it is 
advisable for us to present a description of the phenomena about which we 
propose to theorize. As usual, our presentation of the data will be sketchy 
at best. The data problems discussed in Chapter 5 all apply here as well. 
Letit sucetosay that at many stagesourobservationalpictureisbased on 
inadequate data; in almost all cases, the analyses of data have required the 
extrication of Fourier components from noisy data, and in some instances 
eventhe observationalinstrumentshaveintroduced uncertainties.Details of 
some of these matters may befoundinChapman andLindzen(1970). 
For many years, almost all data analyses for atmospheric tides were 
based on surface pressure data. Although tidal oscillations in surface pres
sure are generally small, at quite a few stations we have as much as 50100 
years of hourly or bi-hourly data. As a result, even today, our best tidal 
data are for surface pressure. Figures 9.5 and 9.6 show the amplitude and 
phase of the solar semidiurnal oscillation overtheglobe; they wereprepared 
byHaurwitz(1956), onthebasisofdatafrom296 stations11 .Thephaseover 
most of the globe is relatively constant, implying the dominance of the mi
grating semidiurnal tide,but other components arefound as well(the most 
signicant of which is the semidiurnal standing oscillation for which s =0; 
viz. Figure9.7). If welet t =local timenon-dimensionalizedby thesolarday, 
then, according to Haurwitz, the solar semidiurnal tide is well represented 
by: 
S2(p)= 1.16 sin3  sin(4t +158) 
+0.085 P2()sin(4tu +118)mbar, (9.1)

With respect to the second question we obtain S2(ps) 1.1 mb(with 
two thirds of this coming from 03)with maxima at 0900 and 2100 LT. The 
amplitude is about right but the observed maxima occur at 0940 and 2140 
LT.For S1(ps), it is more usefulto look at the Hough decomposition

The sum of Equations 9.41 and 9.42 reasonably accounts for observations. 
Note the relative suppression of trapped modes. Overall, the largest contrib
utorto S1(ps)is the ineectively excited rst propagating mode. Note also 
that at least three modes are of comparable importance.

shows theoretical results for semidiurnal northerly velocity oscillations. A 
comparison with Figure 9.18 shows compatibility with observed magnitudes 
but the theory predicts a 180 phase shift near 28 km while it is observed 
at muchgreaterheights. Interestingly,both thisdiscrepancy and thatinthe 
phase of S2(ps) led to the recognition that an additional important source 
oftidalforcing arisesfromthedaily variationsintropical rainfall(Lindzen,

9.1 History and the scientic method 
Textbooks in meteorology (and most other sciences) usually treat history 
(if they treat it at all) as an entertaining diversion from the meat of a 
subject. I would hardly deny the fact that history is entertaining; however, 
I also happen to think that history is basic to the subject. In any eld 
where there has been any success at all, one ought to see how signicant 
problems were actuallydened and solved(atleastto the extentthat they 
weredened and solved). Fromthispoint of view,thisbook actuallydevotes 
too little space to history. Thus, the present brief history of the study of 
atmospherictideswillhavetoserveasasurrogateforalltheomittedhistories 
of other topics we have covered. As such it is a relatively good choice. 
Just as atmospherictidesconstitutesarelativelysimpleproblemindynamic 
meteorology, sotoothehistory of thistopic(atleast until recently)has also 
been relatively easy to describe. To be sure a professional historian might 
balk at such aremark,buthopefully,thereaderwillbe moreindulgent of an 
amateurs approach. The history of the study of atmospheric tides provides 
aparticularlygood exampleof theformandpitfallsof the scienticmethod 
in an observational science such as meteorology. Controlled experiments are 
generallyout ofthequestion.Instead,onebeginswithincompletely observed 
phenomena which are addressed by theoretical explanations. Explanations 
which go no further than dealing with the partial observations are more 
nearly simulationsthantheories,andgivenhumannature,itisusuallypretty 
certain that one will simulate pretty well what has been already observed. 
A theory should go further  it should oer predictions that go beyond the 
presentobservationssothatthecredibilityof thetheory canbetested asnew 
observations are made. Quite properly, failure to conrm predictions tends 
to discredit theories, but conrmation does not as a rule rigorously establish 
the correctness of a theory; it merely increases our condence in the theory. 
The process, in fact, can continue almost indenitely, though at some point 
our condence may seem so well founded that further tests will have a lower 
priority. The whole process is muddied by the fact that meteorological data</text>

and Batavia(6S, the present day capitol of Indonesia, Jakarta). Clearly, 
whatever tiny tide that might exist at middle latitudes is swamped by large 
meteorologicaldisturbances3 . In the tropics, on the other hand, synoptic 
scale pressure perturbations are very small, while tidal oscillations are rela
tivelylarge. Thepeculiarfeature of theseatmospheric surfacepressuretides 
is that they are primarily solar semidiurnal. Laplace, already aware of this 
fact, concluded that the solar dominance implied a thermal origin. 
It wasLordKelvin(1882) who most clearly recognized theparadoxical 
characterof these early observations. First,however,heconrmed the exist
ingdatabycollectingandharmonically analyzingdatafromthiry stationsfor 
diurnal,semidiurnal,and terdiurnal components. Theessenceof theparadox 
is as follows: Gravitational tides are semidiurnal due to the intrinsic semid
iurnal character of the forcing; if, however, atmospheric tides are thermally 
forced,thentheirforcingispredominantlydiurnal. Why thenistheresponse 
stillpredominantly semidiurnal?Kelvinputforward thehypothesisthatthe 
atmosphere had a free oscillation with zonal wavenumber 2 and a period 
near 12 hours which was resonantly excited by the small semidiurnal com
ponent of the thermal forcing. The reason that there is semidiurnal thermal 
forcing is simply that solar heating occurs only during approximately half

One of the most straightforward and illuminating applications of internal 
gravitywave theory is the explanation of the atmospheres tides. In any real 
problemwemustadaptthetheory tothespecicproblematissue. Fortides, 
we must consider the following: 1. We are on an unbounded atmosphere; and 
2. We are on a rotating sphere. 
By atmospheric tides we generally mean those planetary scale oscilla
tions whose periods are integral fractions of a solar or lunar day (diurnal 
referstoaperiod of oneday, semidiurnal referstoaperiod ofhalf aday,and 
terdiurnal refersto aperiod of onethird of aday). Theseperiods are chosen 
because we know there is forcing at these periods. Gravitational forcing is 
precisely known; thermalforcing(dueinlarge measuretothe absorption of 
sunlightby O3 and water vapor) is known with less precision. Nevertheless, 
a situation where forcing of known frequency is even reasonably well known 
isasituation of raresimplicity,and wemayplausibly expectthat our ability 
to calculate the observed response to such forcing constitutes a modest test 
of the utility of theory.

The distribution he found was one where the temperature decreased with 
height as observed in the troposphere; above the tropopause (ca. 12km) 
the temperatureincreased withheightto ahigh value(350K) near50km, 
and then decreased upwards to a low value. It should be noted that in the 
mid1930swehad nodirect measurementsof upperatmospheretemperature. 
However,independentlyofPekeris,MartynandPulley(1936),onthebasisof 
then recent meteor and anomalous sound data, proposed an observationally 
based thermal structure of the atmosphere which was in remarkable agree
ment with whatPekerisneeded.It wasalmost asthoughPekerishaddeduced 
the atmospheres complete thermal structure from tidal data at the earths 
surface, simply by assuming resonance. His results, moreover, appeared to 
explain other observations of ionospheric and geomagnetic tidal variations. 
The vindication of the resonance theory seemed virtually complete. Pekeris 
countered Taylors earlier criticism by showing that a low-level disturbance 
wouldprimarily excitethefaster mode associated with h =10.4km. Areex
amination of the Krakatoa evidence by Pekeris even showed some evidence 
for the existence of the slower mode for which h =7.85km. 
Atthispoint abit of editorial comment mightbein order. If our story 
weretoend atthispoint,it wouldhavedescribed atruly remarkablescientic 
achievement.Infact,as weshall soon see,theresonancetheoryproved tobe 
profoundly wrong. The ability of Pekeriss theory to predict something well 
beyond the data that had motivated the theory did not end up proving the 
correctness of the theory! It will be useful to look at the remainder of this 
story to see where things fell apart. In some ways it is a fairly complicated 
story. However, before proceding, a few things should be noted concerning 
Pekerisswork. Theexplanationof theionosphericandgeomagneticdatadid 
not(onsubsequentscrutiny) actuallydepend onthe resonancehypothesis. 
It is not, however, unheard of in science that one success is used to bolster 
anotherunrelated success.Similarly,PekerissreexaminationoftheKrakatoa 
datademonstratestheveryrealdangersrelatingtotheanalysisof ambiguous 
and noisy data by theoreticians with vested interests in the outcome of the 
analysis. Pekerissclaimsforthedataanalysisweremodest and circumspect, 
but even with thebest will tobe objective,he wouldhavehaddiculty not 
seeing at least hints of what he wanted to see. But all this is jumping ahead 
of our story. For fteen years following Pekeriss remarkable work, most 
research on this subject was devoted to the renement and interpretation of 
Pekerisswork. Thisresearchiscomprehensivelyreviewedinamonographby

One of the remarkable features of S2(p)is the fact that it hardly varies with 
season. This canbe seenfromFigure9.8. The situationis moredicultfor 
S1(p). It varies with season, it is weaker, and it is strongly polluted by non
migratingdiurnal oscillations(viz. Figure 9.9). There are values of s with 
amplitudes as large as 1/4 of that pertaining to s =1. (ForS2(p),s =2 was 
twenty times as large as its nearest competitor.) Moreover, large values of s, 
being associated with asmall scale(largegradients),producelargerwinds 
for a given amplitude of pressure oscillation than s = 1. We will return to 
thislater. According toHaurwitz(1965), S1(p) is roughly representable as

the time average of the dierence between wind soundings at 0000 UT and 
1200UTshould represent asnapshot of theoddharmonicsof thedaily varia

semidiurnal tidesbelow50 mb(theupperlimit ofECMWF analyses). Their 
results for the semidiurnal oscillation in zonal wind along the equator are 
shown in Figure 9.12. We see a clear wavenumber 2 pattern indicative of a 
migrating tide. We also see very little tilt with height. The diurnal oscil
lations are more complicated. Figure 9.13 shows a snapshot of the diurnal 
component of the height eld along the equator at 0000 GMT averaged over 
the winter of 1986/87. There is a clear wavenumber 1 pattern with some 
evidence of phase tilt. However, the distortion from a strict sine wave has 
important consequencesforthediurnal windpattern(Why?). Thisbecomes 
evident in Figure 9.14 which shows a comparably averaged snapshot of the 
diurnal component of the horizontal wind at 850 mb. The pattern is more 
complicated; wavenumber1is nolonger self-evidentlydominant. There are 
numerousregionaldiurnal circulations. Figure9.15 showsasimilarsnapshot

regular than the diurnal oscillation? 
2. Can we account for the specic observed magnitudes and structures?

are formed such that poleward of 30 negative equivalentdepth modes oscil
late meridionally(real ) and equatorward of 30 they decay exponentially 
(imaginary). The opposite situation obtains for positive equivalent depth 
modes. In addition,thepositive(propagating) modes,being conned tothe 
region &lt; 30, have much larger eective s (meridional wavenumbers) ||
and smaller hs than would global modes. This matter will be elucidated in 
an exercise.

The above results provide an immediate answer to our rst question: 
S1(ps)is weakerbecause most of theforcinggoesintotrapped modes which 
do not eectively inuence the ground. It is irregular largely because the 
surface response involves higher order modes which are more susceptible to 
regional variations. (Note that winds associated with higher order modes 
may even be larger.) By contrast, S2(p2)receives almost all its forcing in a 
singleglobal modewhichisinsensitivetoregionaluctuations. Moreover,the 
main S-D mode has an almost innite VWL so that all forcing contributes 
inphase12 .

and pressure is replaced by geopotential 
= gz(z). 
The only (minor) diculty with this scheme is that the lower boundary 
conditionisthat 
w =0 at z =0 (9.5) 
and w is not the vertical velocity. 
Thecorrectlowerboundary conditioninlog pcoordinatesisobtained 
asfollows: 
At z = z =0,w =0, so that

w = ps dt = ps t + w
dz = ps t . 
p p From dp = tdt ++ zdz weget  
 p p z t t = = t p g p z

p  = . t t 
Thus

w = ps t = gH(0) t at z =0. (9.6)

The situationforsurfacepressureisfairly straightforward.S2(p)1mb with 
maxima at 0940 and 2140; S1(p)0.6mb with a maximum at 2312; and 
L2(p).08mb with maxima 1020 and 2220 lunar time In addition, S1 is 
quite variable and irregular, S2 is stable, and L2 is somewhat seasonally 
variable with global seasonality. 
The situation higher up is more complex: 
The diurnal tide in horizontal wind is stronger in stratosphere. Also, there is 
more phase variation with altitude at lower latitudes than at high latitudes. 
There is something of a gap in data between 60 and 80 km. 
In mesosphere and lower thermosphere, the semidiurnal tide in horizontal 
wind appearsstrongerathigherlatitudes whilethediurnal tideseemstodom
inate at lower latitudes. 
In the thermosphere, results seem to depend on solar activity. 
9.3 Theory 
We will restrict ourselves to migrating tides whose dependence on time and 
longitudeisgivenby e2ist where t = local time in days. t = tu + /2, 
where  is longitude and tu = universal time. We will generally refer to tu 
simply as t. s =1correspondstoadiurnal tide; s =2referstoasemidiurnal 
tide, and so forth. Such oscillations have phase speeds equal to the linear 
rotation speed of the earth. Since this speed is generally much larger than 
typical ow speeds we usually assume the basic state to be static. Also the 
periodsaresucientlylongtoallowustousethehydrostaticapproximation. 
This, in turn, allows us to replace z as a vertical coordinate with 
z ln pp 
s . (9.3) 
  z dz RT0(Recallp = psez ,where z = 0 H ,H = g ).Thiscoordinatesystem(log 
pressure) is described in Holton. The resulting equations no longer formally 
includedensity,and,asaresult,theyarevirtuallyidenticaltotheBoussinesq 
equations without, however, the same restrictions. In this coordinate system 
vertical velocity is replaced by

In order to simplify calculations, Siebert used a basic temperature prole 
which wasexceedingly unrealisticabovethetropopause. Asweshall seelater 
inthis chapter,thisproleprevented theverticalpropagation of semidiurnal 
tidal oscillationsfromthe stratospheretothetroposphere. ButlerandSmall 
(1963) soon corrected this error, and showed that ozone absorption indeed 
accountedfortheremainingtwo-thirdsofthesurfacesemidiurnal oscillation9 . 
With a successful and robust theory in hand for the solar semidiurnal 
tide, we must return to Kelvins seminal question: Why isnt the diurnal 
oscillation stronger than the semidiurnal? With the increased data available 
by the mid1960s, even this question had become less obvious. Data above 
theground up toabout100kmshowed that at manylevelsandlatitudes,the 
diurnal oscillations were as strong and often stronger than semidiurnal os
cillations.Lindzen(1967) carried outtheoretical calculationsforthediurnal 
tide which provided satisfactory answers for the observed features. Central 
to the explanationisthefactthat onhalf of theglobe(polewards of 30 
latitude),24hrislongerthanthelocalpendulumday(theperiod corre
sponding to the local Coriolis parameter), and under these circumstances a 
24hroscillationisincapableofpropagating vertically. Wewill explainthis 
behaviour later in this chapter. In any event, because of this, it turns out 
that 80 percent of the diurnal forcing goes into physically trapped modes 
which cannot propagate disturbances forced aloft to the ground. The atmo
spheric response to these modes in the neighbourhood of the excitation is, 
however, substantial10 . In addition, there exist(primarily equatorwards of 
30 latitude) diurnal modes which propagate vertically. However, as one 
coulddeducefromthedispersiveproperties ofinternalgravity waves(viz. 
Equation 8.55), the long period and the restricted latitude scale of these 
waves causesthemtohave relatively short vertical wavelengths(25km or 
less). They are, therefore, subject to some destructive interference eects. 
Butler and Small suggested, in fact, that this could explain the relatively 
small amplitudeof thediurnal tide,but subsequent calculationsshowed that 
9In a rough sense, the work of Butler and Small completes our present understanding 
of the semidiurnal surface oscillation. However, as we shall see, the understanding is by 
no means complete. There is a discrepancy of about on hour in phase between theory 
and observation. Thereisalsoaproblemwith thepredicted vertical structureof thetidal 
elds. Recent work suggests that these discrepancies are related to daily variations in 
rainfall.

In the region between 30 and 60 km, most of our data come from me
teorological rocket soundings. These are comparatively infrequent and the 
method of analysis becomes apriori, a serious problem. However, it turns 
outthat results ofdierentanalyses appeartobe compatible(atleastfor 
the diurnal component) because tidal winds at these heights are already a 
very signicantpart of thetotal wind(atleastinthenorth-southdirection). 
This is seen in Figure 9.17, where we show the southerly wind as mea
sured overaperiod of51h atWhiteSands,N.M.Analyses of tidal wavesat 
various latitudes are now available. Figure 9.18 shows the phase and ampli
tude of the semidiurnal oscillation at about 30N. Below 50 km, the results 
appearquiteuncertain(Reed,1967). In Figures9.19 and9.20weseethe

order of 10 m sec1 at 60 km but phase at 20N is more variable than at

Between 60 km and 80 km, there are too few data for tidal analyses. 
Between 80 and 105 km, there is a growing body of data from the observa
tion of ionized meteor trails by Doppler radar. The earliest such data were

We already have 
I(xs)= Is. (2.12) 
But since 
I(xs)= I(xs,xs)Q, (2.13) 
by combining(2.12) and(2.13) wehave 
Q 1 = , (2.14) Is I(xs,xs)

Normally,weexpect advancingice(decreasing xs)tobeassociated with 
decreasing Q.Such asituationisgenerally stableinthe sensethatthetime

denedby(2.14) decayintime. This stabilityiseasyto understandintu
itively. If, for example, one decreased xs whileholding Q constant, thenQ 
would be larger than needed for that value of xs and the resulting warming 
would cause xs to increase. This is, in fact, the situation when we do not 
have transport. Surprisingly, the introduction of transport always leads to 
some values of xs wheredecreasing xs is associated with increasing Q  an 
unstable situationleading to anice covered earth(atleastinthe context of 
the simple model). 
We shall examine how this occurs under particularly simple conditions. 
First we shall use(2.5) for F [T ].Nextweshall takethefollowing expression

this model would have been largely forgotten. However, it has returned to 
some popularity in connection with the debate over whether there were pe
riods whenthe earth wastotallyice covered(the so-called snowball earth 
). In this chapter, we will not discuss such matters in detail, since we are 
primarily concerned with the illustrative aspects of this model rather than 
detailed realism. 
As far as this chapter is concerned, there are two major points to this 
exercise: 
1. To invent a model which illustrates the impact of dynamic transport 
on climate, and 
2. To consider the impact of seemingly innocent modeling assumptions. 
This inevitably leads to a consideration of broader issues concerned with 
modeling, and, in particular, with the profound dierence between model
ing and approximation. Over the years, I have noticed that students often 
respond to this exercise by attaching undue credibility to this model, and 
quickly fall into the trap of discussing the model output in terms of nature. 
Ifsuch atrivial model canprovokesuch aresponse,therecanbelittlesurprise 
at the temptation to treat more complex models in a similar manner. 
The specic models that we will work with are typically characterized 
asfollows: 
1. Only latitude dependences are considered; that is, the models are spa
tially one-dimensional(though timedependenceisalso sometimescon
sidered). 
2. Global energybudgetsareassumed tobeexpressibleintermsof surface 
temperatures. 
3. Planetary albedoistakentodependprimarily oniceand/orsnowcover 
orthelack thereof. 
4. The convergence of dynamic heat uxes is generally represented by 
either a simple diusion law or by a linear heating law wherein local 
heating is proportional to deviations of the global mean temperature 
from the local surface temperature. The primary feature of the heat 
transport is that it carries heat from warmer to colder regions. Both of 
the above representations do this.</text>

 T F [T ]= (1x 2)D, (2.6) x x 
where C and D in(2.5) and(2.6) are constants; they aregenerally chosento 
simulate some features of the existing climate. 
The most common application of(2.1) involvesassuming a steady state 
and seeking a relation between the equilibrium position of the ice line and 
the solar constant. Usually, onelinearizes(2.3) to obtain 
I = A + BT, (2.7) 
and replaces T by I asdenedin(2.7). Equation2.1becomes3 
Qs(x)A(I)I + F [I]=0. (2.8) 
Oneidentiestheicelinewithatemperature Ts,orequivalently Is = A+BTs. 
We shall use xs to identify the value of x at I = Is. Moreover, variations in 
Aare taken to be due solely to whether or not there is an ice surface, that 
is, 
A= A(x,xs). (2.9) 
Cor Din(2.4) willbe chosen so thatforthepresent climate T = Ts at 
the present annually averaged value of xs (i.e., xs 0.95). Obtaining the 
dependence of xs on Q (or more conveniently, the dependence ofQ on xs)is 
straightforward. If we write 
I = QI(x), (2.10) 
and assume F tobealinearoperator,thenwemaydivide(2.8)by Q,yielding 
F [I]+I= s(x)A(x,xs). (2.11) 
For any choice of xs we may solve(2.11) for I= I(x,xs). It is now a trivial

Moreover,HeldandSuarez(1974)haveshownthat500mb temperatures 
correlate better with infrared emission than do surface temperatures. Nev
ertheless, it is the surface temperature which relates to the formation of ice, 
and which thereforemustbe usedinsimpleclimatemodels. (Notethat such 
compromises with the underlying physics in order that the resulting model 
doeswhat wewantittodoarenot uncommon. Almost allparameterizations 
fall into this situation to some extent.) The fact that total infrared emission 
is not perfectly related to surface temperature is merely an indication that 
a signicant portion of the emitted radiation originates in the atmosphere 
(What is the reason for this?). Similarly, not all of the incoming radiation 
is absorbed atthe surface; inpractice,some of theincoming radiationis not 
directlyinvolvedinthe surface energy budget. 
Asarule,modelsbased onEquation2.1 takelittleaccount of cloudsand 
cloud feedbacks. In truth we hardly know how to include such feedbacks. It 
is probably impossible in such a simple model. However, to the extent that 
clouds can be specied in terms of latitude and surface temperature, their 
eects on incoming radiation and on infrared emission can be included in 
Equations 2.2 and 2.3. In reality, this is almost certainly a bad approxima
tion. Consider, for example, the dierence in cloud cover between summer 
and winter; they are quite similar. 
The divergence of atmospheric and oceanic heat ux must also be ex
pressed in terms of an operator on surface temperature; that is, 
div ux = F [T ], (2.4) 
where F issomeoperator. Usually F isalinearoperator, althoughHeld and 
Suarez(1974) andNorth(1975) have also considered nonlinear operators as 
suggestedby Green(1970) andStone(1973). The common choicesfor F [T ] 
arealinearrelation rstsuggestedby Budyko(1969): 
 F [T ]= C (T T ), (2.5)

When C = 0, the denominator decreases as xs increases, as already noted. 
But, when C = 0, there always exists some neighbourhood of xs = 0 where 
the linear term in (2.27) dominates, and the denominator increases as xs 
increases. This leads to the distribution of Q versus xs showninFigure2.4. 
Figure2.4: Equilibriumicelineposition xs as a function of normalized solar constant 
Q/Q0 (whereQ0 is the current value of the solar constant) when Budyko-type heat trans
port is used. The curve Q/Q0 corresponds to T = Ts on the equatorward side of the 
ice line, while Q+/Q0 corresponds to T = Ts on the poleward side. The single remaining 
curve results from adding a small amount of diusion to the Budyko-type transport. 
Two features should be noted in Figure 2.4, both being due to the exis
tence of horizontal heat transport: 
1. A much smaller value of Q is needed for ice/snow to onset at all. This 
represents the stabilizing eect of transport. 
2. There now exists some minimum Q, below which the climate will un
stablyproceed toanice/snowcovered earth. Thisrepresentsthedesta
bilizing eect of transport. 
Both the above eects result very generally from the sharing of heat 
between low and high latitudes. Clearly, heat transport from low latitudes

5. Generally, only annual mean conditions are considered, although some
times annual mean conditions are replace by equinoctial conditions. 
(It is worth pointing out, in passing, that all of the above modeling as
sumptions are actually incorrect.) The starting point for such models is an 
equation of the form

pressedintermsof thesurfacetemperature,the rsttermontheright-hand 
side ofEquation2.1isgenerally takentobethetotalinsolation as mightbe 
determinedby a satelliteabovethe atmosphere. Itistypically written as 
incoming solar radiation = Qs(x)A(T ), (2.2) 
where Q isonequarterofthesolarconstant(Why?) and s(x)is a function 
whoseintegralfromtheequatortothepoleisunity and which representsthe 
annually averaged latitude distribution of incoming radiation. This function 
isdiscussedinHeldandSuarez(1974). Finally,A(T )is1minustheplanetary 
albedo; Ais allowed to depend on temperature. In most simple climate 
models,atemperature Ts isidentiedwith theonset ofice(snow) coversuch 
thatfor T &gt;Ts thereisnoice(snow), andfor T &lt;Ts there is. The most 
important change in A, in these models,isdueto T passing through Ts.We 
will specify Amore explicitlylater. 
Againundertheassumptionthatglobalenergybudgetscanbeexpressed 
in terms of surface temperature, one writes 
infrared cooling = I(T ). (2.3) 
The justication for Equation 2.3 is that temperature proles have more</text>

or less the same shape at all latitudes. Hence cooling, which depends on 
the temperature at all levels, ought to be expressible in terms of surface 
temperature, since the temperature at all levels is related to the surface 
temperature.Infact,temperatureprolesatdierentlatitudesaresomewhat

My initial purpose in beginning with an energy balance climate model was 
toprovide a simplemodel whereintheinteractionsof radiation(including 
the eect of snow on albedo) and dynamic heat transport could be consid
ered. The above references mostly date back to the period where there was 
concernoverglobal cooling and thepossibility of anewiceage. Intheabove 
referencessomeattemptismadetojustify therealismof the models. Thisis 
certainly worth thinking about; however,aswewillsee,most of theattempts 
amounted tolittlemorethan specialpleading. Giventhe currentpopularity 
of global warming rather than global cooling, one might have thought that

 = 0.4 
(2.16) 
 = 0.7. 
(Note,thatbylettingtherebe adiscretejumpin Aat the latitude where 
T = Ts, we have implicitly replaced the annual mean with something like a 
permanent equinox. Why?) For Ts we, for the moment, take Ts = 10C, 
and for the constants A and B in(2.7) we use A =211.1Wm2, and B = 
1.55Wm2(C)1 . Hence, Is = 195.7Wm2 . For s(x) we use the annual 
averagefunction as approximatedby North(1975): 
s(x) 10.241(3x 2 1). (2.17) 
For the present solar constant, 
Q =344Wm2 . 
For the above choices, straightforward analytic solutions exist. Let us begin 
by neglecting all transport. Equation 2.8 becomes 
Qs(x)A(x,xs)A BT =0, 
or 
T = Qs(x)A(x,xs)A. (2.18) B 
This radiative equilibrium value of T depends only on the local radiative 
budget. ItsdistributionisshowninFigure2.2asistheobserveddistribution. 
Note that the observed gradients are much smaller than in the equi
librium distribution. The value of Q associated with xs is not unique. Any 
valueof Q lessthanthevalueneededfor T (xs)= Ts with A= ,andgreater 
thanthevalueneededfor T (xs)= Ts with A= ,isconsistent with xs.This 
leads to the two curves for Q(xs)shown in Figure 2.3:</text>

to such an extent that Q must actually be increased to keep up with further 
advances. Thissituationisclearly unstable. Weshall refertothepercentage 
Q must be reduced from its present value to reach instability as the global 
stability. The results in Figure 2.4 correspond to a global stability of only 
2%. To be sure, the solar constant might not vary this much. However, Q 
can be viewed as a general measure of global heating. Changes in Q canbe 
simulated by changes in I and/or A, for example. 
As will be seen in the exercise, the above estimate of global stability is 
hardly rm(eveninthecontextof thismodel),butouronly interest atthis 
point is in the general role of heat transport.</text>

8.5 Energy ux 
We have already noted that pw is not the complete expression for the wave 
ux of energy. It is merely the contribution of the pressure-work term to 
the ux. In addition, there is the advection by the wave elds of the kinetic 
energy of the mean ow, 0uwU (Show this.). Thus, the full expression for 
the energy ux is 
FE = pw+ 0uwU. (8.26) 
Note that now dFE/dz = 0 under the conditions for which non-interaction 
holds. On the other hand, FE is arbitrary up to a Galilean transformation, 
and hence may no longer be associated with the direction of wave propaga
tion. 
The above diculty does not depend on U having shear, so we will 
restrict ourselves to the case where dU/dz =0. We will also ignore time 
variationsin 0  which is acceptable for a Boussinesq uid. Finally, we will 
assume the presence of a slight amount of damping which will lead to some 
absorptionof wave uxesand theconsequent modicationof thebasicstate:

Atmosphericwaves(eddies) areimportantintheir own right as major com
ponents of the total circulation. They are also major transporters of energy 
and momentum. For a medium to propagate a disturbance as a wave there 
must be a restoring force, and in the atmosphere, this arises, primarily, 
from two sources: conservation of potential temperature in the presence of 
positive static stability and from the conservation of potential vorticity in 
the presence of a mean gradient of potential vorticity. The latter leads to 
what areknownasRossby waves. Theformerleadstointernalgravity waves 
(andsurfacegravity wavesaswell).Internalgravity wavesaresimplertoun
derstand and clearly manifest the various ways in which waves interact with 
the mean state. For reasons which will soon become clear, internal gravity 
waves are not a dominant part of the midlatitude tropospheric circulation 
(thoughthey areimportant). Nonetheless,wewill study theminsomedetail 
 as prototype atmospheric waves. As a bonus, the theory we develop will 
be sucient to allow us to understand atmospheric tides, upper atmosphere 
turbulence, and the quasi-biennial oscillation of the stratosphere. We will

8.2 Heuristic theory(no rotation) 
In studying atmospheric thermodynamics you have seen that a neutrally 
buoyant blob in a stably stratied uid will oscillate up and down with a 
frequency N. Applying this to the conguration in Figure 8.2, we get

foran unbounded uid that satises eithertheradiationconditionorbound

solutionswill,however,bepossiblewhenweallowsuchfeaturesascompress
ibility and height variable basic stratication.) For Equation 8.42 to have 
homogeneous solutions (free oscillations) there must be a bounding upper 
surface. Ifthisis afree surface(such as the ocean surface; the atmosphere 
doesnthavesuch asurface),thentheappropriate upperboundary condition 
is dp/dt =0. Linearizing this condition yields

Using Equations 8.35 and 8.38, Equation 8.44 becomes

wz = gw at z =H. (8.45) 2
Solving Equation 8.42 subject to Equation 8.45 and the condition 
w =0at z =0 (8.46) 
leads to our free oscillations. Equation 8.42 will have solutions of the form 
w =sinhz,

w =sinz, 
where

motions will be excited in the uid above the plate with frequency,  = kc. 
For our oscillating blob we used F = ma. Normally, we cannot use this 
for uid ows because of the pressure force. However, in a wave eld there 
will be lines of constant phase. Along these lines the pressure perturbation 
will be constant and hence pressure gradients along such lines will be zero, 
and the acceleration of the uid along such lines will, indeed, be given by 
F = ma. 
Assume such lines make an angle  with respect to the vertical. The 
projection of the buoyancy force is then 
F = N2z cos.</text>

more subtle excitations of gravity waves arise from uid instabilities, 
collapse of fronts, squalls, and so forth. 
The above, heuristic, analysis tells us much about gravity waves  and 
is simpler and more physical than the direct application of the equations. 
However,itisrestrictedtoverticalwavelengthsmuch shorterthanthe uids 
scale height; it does not include rotation, friction, or the possibility that the 
unperturbed basic state might have a spatially variable ow. To extend 
the heuristic approach to such increasingly complicated situations becomes 
almost impossible. It is in these circumstances that the equations of motion 
come into their own. 
8.3 Linearization 
Implicit in the above was that the gravity waves were small perturbations 
on the unperturbed basic state. What does this involve in the context of 
the equations of motion? Consider the equation of x-momentum on a non-
rotating plane for an inviscid uid: 
u u u u 1p 
t + ux + vy + wz =  x . (8.7) 
Intheabsenceof waveperturbationsassumeasolutionof thefollowingform: 
u = u0(y,z) 
p = p0(y,z) 
 = 0(y,z) 
v0 =0 
w0 =0. 
Equation 8.7 is automatically satised. Now, add to the basic state, pertur
bations u,v,w,,p. Equation8.7becomes 
u u u u0 u 
+ u0 + u+ v+ v

          <text>172 DynamicsinAtmosphericPhysics 
Our lower boundary condition can be used to determine either 0 and 0, 
or 1 and 1. In either case, 8.74 can be used to determine all subsequent 
ks and ks(upward sweep). 8.71 will nowgive us all wks if we have wK 
or wK +1. Wegetthisfromthe upperboundary condition(eitherone as 
appropriate). The above algorithm solves for the complex values of wk at 
each level. In practice, it is more convenient to look at the amplitudes and 
phases where 
amplitude(wk)=  
(Re(wk))2 +(Im(wk))21/2 
and 
Im(wk)phase(wk)= arctan . Re(wk) 
8.8.4 Testing the Algorithm 
The simplicity of Equation 8.56, especially when Q2 is constant, makes it 
easy to compare our numerical solutions with analytic solutions under a 
variety of conditions. This is a proper, but incomplete, test. It is proper 
becauseitprovidesastandard of comparisonexternal tothenumerical model 
itself. Itisincomplete,becausethecase of Q2 being constant is very special, 
while for more general variations in Q2, it becomes much more dicult to 
obtain analyticsolutions. Tests withoutproper standardsof comparison(for 
example, modelintercomparisons) are,ingeneral,lackingin credibility.</text>

When this is combined with Equation 8.62 evaluated at zK, we get 
aK bK wK1 +( 2 aT)wK =2 bT. (8.69) 
For the upper boundary condition given by Equation 8.68, we have 
wK+1 = dT, (8.70) 
which is already in the form we will need. Our system of equations now 
consist in Equation 8.62 subject to a lower boundary condition given by 
either Equation 8.65 or Equation 8.66, and subject to an upper boundary 
condition given by either Equation 8.69 or Equation 8.70. 
8.8.3 Numerical Algorithm 
The above systemis easily solved using the up-down sweep method(which 
issimplyGaussian elimination).Tobegin, weintroducetwonewvectors, k 
and k, related as follows: 
wk = k wk+1 (8.71) k 
The up-sweep portion of the algorithm consists in determining k and k. 
To do this, we substitute 8.71 into 8.62. 
wk wk+1 + akwk + k1 = bk,k1 
or 
wk+1 +(ak  1)wk = bk  k1 . (8.72) k1 k1 
Rewriting 8.71 as follows 
wk+1 + kwk = k, (8.73) 
and comparing 8.72 with8.73, weimmediatelyget 
1 k = ak  8.74a k1 
k = bk  k1 . 8.74b k1</text>

Now multiplyEquation8.27by U, 
  
U2 
d 0 = U0uw, (8.29) t 2 dz 
and subtract Equation 8.29 from Equation 8.28, 
d 0 Q = pw. (8.30) tdz 
From Equation 8.29, we see that the second term in Equation 8.26 is associ
ated withthe alteration ofthekinetic energy ofthebasic state(associated 
with wave absorption), and that the choice of a Galilean frame can lead to 
eitheradecrease or anincrease ofthe meankineticenergy(Why?). From 
Equation8.30 weseethattheconvergenceof pwis,ontheotherhand,asso
ciated with mean heating. Since we do not wish the absorption of a wave to 
cool a uid, we are forced to identify the direction of pw with thedirection 
of wave propagation. (Recallthat the wave is attenuated in the direction of 
propagation.) 
8.6 A remark about eddies 
Asweproceed with ourdiscussionof eddies,it willbecomeeasy tolosetrack

(i)tofamiliarizeyou with thefoundations and methodologies ofdynamics; 
(ii)to use this tool to account for some of the observed motion systems of 
the atmosphere and oceans; and 
(iii)to examine the roles of these systems in the general circulation. 
Youcanbe reasonably assured that our approach to(ii) will not bevery sys
tematic.Evenwithitem(iii),it will notbeeasy toprovideastraightforward

the perturbation decays with height. Equation 8.1 may be solved for :

In our treatment of the symmetric circulation our approach was to cal
culate a symmetric circulation and see to what extent it accounted for ob
servations. Our assumption was that the degree to which symmetric models 
failedpointedtheway totheroleof eddies. Wewillfollowasimilarlyindirect 
path in studying eddies and their roles. The diculty here is that there are 
many kinds of eddies! Broadly speaking, we have gravity and Rossby waves 
 but these may be forced, or they may be free drum head oscillations, or 
they may even be instabilities of the basic ow. We shall not, of course, 
study these various eddies at random. We investigate various waves because 
they seemsuitabletoparticularphenomena. However,there alwaysremains 
astrong element of seeing whathappens which should neitherbeforgotten 
nor underestimated. 
8.7 Formal mathematical treatment 
We shall now return to the problem considered heuristically earlier in this 
chapterinordertodeal withitinamoreformal manner. Thisapproach will

where ak 2Qk 2 2, and bk 2Jk. 
At z = 0 we separately consider boundary conditions of the following 
forms 
dw + aBw = bB, (8.63) dz 
or 
w = dB. (8.64) 
Forlowerboundary conditionsof theform8.63,the most accurate approach 
is to introduce a ctitious point, z1. Then the nite dierence form of the 
lower boundary condition is 2 
w1 w1 + aBw0 = bB. 2 
Applying 8.62 at the lower boundary, and using the boundary condition to 
eliminate w1, we then get 
a0 b0 w1 +( +aB)w0 = +bB. (8.65) 2 2 
For boundary conditions of the form of 8.64, we combine this boundary 
condition with Equation 8.62 applied at level 1 to obtain 
w2 + a1w1 = b1 dB. (8.66) 
For our upper boundary condition, we have the same two choices: 
dw + aTw = bT, (8.67) dz 
or 
w = dT. (8.68) 
For the upper boundary condition given by Equation 8.67, we have 
wK+1 wK1 + aTwK = bT. 2

discontinuities in slope. A much cleaner approach is to represent slopes as 
follows:

= Tz,0 +  
(Tz,n Tz,n1) Tn , (8.57) dz 21 
where Tz,n is the characteristic temperature gradient between zn and zn+1, 
and Tn is the transition width at zn. 
dU n  tanh(zzn )+1   Un= Uz,0 +(Uz,n Uz,n1) , (8.58) dz 21 
where Uz,n is the characteristic shear between zn and zn+1, and Un is the 
transition width at zn. Equations 8.57 and 8.58 are readily integrated to 
obtain T (z)and U(z). (Hint:ln 2cosh z

Eliassen andPalm(1961) developed theirtheoremforthe case where J =0. 
In that case 
 (0uw)=0.	 (8.25) z 
Notice that theorem 1 (Equation 8.14) tells us that the sign of 0uw is 
independent of du0 , while theorem 2 (Equation 8.25) tells us that in the dz 
absence of 
(i)damping, 
(ii)local thermal forcing, and 
(iii)criticallevels(where u0 c =0) 
no momentum ux is deposited or extracted from the basic ow. Contrast 
Equations 8.14 and 8.25 with what one gets assuming Reynolds stresses are 
duetolocallygenerated turbulence(where eddy diusionisdown-gradient), 
and consider the fact that in most of the atmosphere, eddies are, in fact, 
waves. 
From Equation 8.25 and Equation 8.14 we also see that the quantity 
pw/(u0 c)and not pw is conserved. The former is sometimes referred to 
as wave action. 
8.4.1	Moving ame eect and the super-rotation of 
Venus atmosphere 
The role of the right hand side of Equation 8.24 is of some interest. It is 
clearthat DJ =0,atleastinasituation which allowstheradiation of waves 
toinnity. Considerthermalforcing in somelayer(as showninFigure8.4). 
Above J there will be a momentum ux which must come from some place 
and cannot come from the region below J; hence, it must come from the 
thermal forcing region. Moreover, the ux divergence within the heating 
region must be such as to accelerate the uid within the heating region in 
a direction opposite to c. This mechanism has sometimes been called the 
moving ame eect, and has been suggested as the mechanism responsible 
for maintaining an observed 100 m/s zonal ow in Venusian cloud layer, the 
thermal forcing being due to the absorption of sunlight at the cloud top. 
Since this ow is in the direction of Venus rotation, it is referred to as 
super-rotation.</text>

the simple harmonic oscillator equation. The exception is that I will use el

8.1 Some general remarks on waves 
A wavepropagatinginthe x,z-plane will be characterized by functional de
pendence of the form 
cos(t kx z + ). 
Wewillreferto ki+kasthewavevector;theperiod  =2/;thehorizontal 
wavelength = 2/k; the vertical wavelength = 2/. Phase velocity is given 
by 
 i + k, k 
while group velocity is given by 
   i + k. k  
Whenphase velocityandgroup velocity arethesamewerefertothewaveas 
non-dispersive; otherwise it is dispersive; that is, dierent wavelengths will 
havedierentphase speeds and apacket willdisperse. 
8.1.1 Group and signal velocity 
The role of the group velocity in this matter is made clear by the following 
simple argument. Let us restrict ourselves to a signal f(t,x), where 
f(t, 0) = C(t)e i0t . 
We may Fourier expand C(t): 
 
C(t)= B()e itd, 
 
and then</text>

  157 Internal Gravity Waves: Basics 
Terms involving the basic state alone cancelled since the basic state must, 
itself, be a solution. Linearization is possible when the perturbation is so 
small thattermsquadraticintheperturbation are much smallerthanterms 
linear in the perturbation. The linearization of Equation 8.8 is 
u u u0 u0 1 p 
t + u0 x + v
y + w
z = 0 x . (8.9) 
It is sometimes stated that linearization requires uu0, but clearly 
this is too restrictive. The precise assessment of the validity of linearization 
dependsontheparticularproblembeingsolved.Forourtreatment ofgravity 
waves we will always assumethe wavestobelinearizableperturbations. 
Before proceeding to explicit solutions we will prove a pair of theorems 
which are attheheart of wavemean owinteractions. Although wewill not 
be using these theorems immediately, I would like to present them early so 
that there will be time to think about them. I will also discuss the relation 
betweenenergy uxandthedirectionof energypropagation. 
8.4 Eliassen-Palm theorems 
Let usassumethat rotation maybeignored. Let usalsoignoreviscosity and 
thermal conductivity. Finally, let us restrict ourselves to basic ows where 
v0 = w0 =0 and u0 = u0(z). Also, let us include thermal forcing of the form 
J = J(z)e ik(xct) 
and seek solutions with the same x and t dependence. The equation for 
x-momentumbecomes

upward propagating wave carries westerly momentum if c&gt;u0 and easterly 
momentumif c&lt;u0! 
Their second theorem, which tells how 0uw varies with height, is 
hardertoprove. 
Let 
 ik(u0 c) = w =(u0 c) (8.15) x 
(this simply denes the vertical displacement, , for small perturbations). 
Substituting Equation8.15intoEquation8.13yields

8.7.2 Equivalent depth 
Solving Equation8.54for 2/k2 weget

k2 = n22 gh. (8.55)
By analogy with Equation 8.51, h is referred to as the equivalent depth of 
theinternal mode(orfree oscillation). Similarly,inaforcedproblem, where 
weimpose  and k, the relation 
2 
= gh k2 
denesanequivalentdepthfortheforced mode. (Whathappensinachannel 
where v =0 at y =0,L?) This is not, in general, the equivalent depth of 
any particular free oscillation (if it is we have resonance); rather it is a 
measure of the vertical wavenumber or the index of refraction. These terms 
(generalizedto a rotating, spherical atmosphere) play a very important role 
inthetreatmentof atmospherictides.Theformalismof equivalentdepth will 
alsofacilitateourdiscussion ofinternalRossby waves(Chapter11). Finally, 
italsoplaysanimportant roleinthecontemporary study ofequatorial waves. 
8.8 Numerical algorithm 
In this chapter, as well as in several subsequent chapters, equations of the 
form 
wzz + Q2 w = J(z), (8.56) 
will describe the vertical structure of waves. While for most of the examples 
in this chapter, Q was independent of z,ingeneral Q = Q(U(z),T (z),k,), 
where U is a basic prole of zonal wind, T is a basic prole of temperature, 
k is a wave vector, and  is a frequency. For the more general problems, it 
is useful to have a simple way of specifying U and T . 
8.8.1 Specifying Basic States 
The traditional way of specifying U and T was to approximate the distri
butions by regions with constant gradients and match solutions across the</text>

respectively. 
8.7.1 Shallow water limit and internal modes 
Inthelimit of ashallow uid(H 1or H 1) both Equation 8.49 and 
Equation 8.50 reduce to 
2 
= gH, (8.51) k2 
which is independent of N2 . (What do the solutions look like?) In addition, 
Equation 8.50 has an innite number of solutions. In order to examine the 
nature of these solutions it suces to replace Equation 8.45 with 
w =0 at z = H. (8.52) 
Then our solutions become 
w =sin z, 
where 
1/2N2 n  = 2 1 k = H, n =1, 2,... . (8.53) 
Forsimplicitylet us usethehydrostatic approximation. ThenEquation8.53 
becomes

          <text>155 Internal Gravity Waves: Basics 
 Nk/ cpz =  = (k2 + 2)1/2 (8.4) 
 N2 
cgx = k = (k2 + 2)3/2 (8.5) 
 Nk cgz = = . (8.6)  (k2 + 2)3/2 
Thus cpx and cgx are of the same sign, while cpz and cgz are of opposite 
sign. What this means is easily seen from Figure 8.3. Since the wave is 
forced by the moving corrugated plate, the motions must angle to the right 
oftheverticalsothatthemoving corrugationispushingthe uid(pw is 
positive). (Equation 8.2 permits  to be positive or negative, but negative 
values would correspond to the uid pushing the plate.) But then phase 
line A, which is moving to the right, is also seen by an observer at a xed 
x as moving downward. Thus for an internal gravity wave, upward wave 
propagation is associated with downward phase propagation1 . 
Before moving beyond this heuristic treatment, two points should be 
mentioned. 
1. We have already noted that vertical propagation ceases, for positive 
k2 , when 2 exceeds N2 . (For the atmosphere 2/N 5 min.)Itis 
also worth noting what happens as  0. The vertical wavelength 
(2/)0, as does cgz . We may anticipate that in this limit any 
damping will eectivelyprevent verticalpropagation. Why? 
2. The excitation of gravity waves by a moving corrugated plate does 
not seem terribly relevant to either the atmosphere or the ocean. So 
we should see what is needed more generally. What is needed is any
thing which will, as seen by an observer moving with the uid, move 
height surfaces up and down. Thus, rather than move the corruga
tions through the uid, it will suce for the uid to move past xed 
corrugations  or mountains for that matter. Similarly, a heat source 
movingrelativetothe uid willdisplaceheight surfacesand excitegrav
ity waves. The daily variations of solar insolation act this way. Other 
1This is not always true if the uid is moving relative to the observer. The reader is 
urged to examine this possibility.</text>

1. The role of dynamics in simple climate models; and 
2. The role of dynamics in determining the distribution of chemically ac
tive minor constituents. 
Having demonstrated the importance of dynamics in the behavior of the 
atmosphere, we will turn to the motions themselves. The observations will 
be reviewed with primary, but not exclusive, emphasis on specic motion 
systemsratherthanonmeasurementtechniquesandproblems though these 
issues will,of necessity,be referred to. 
Finally, we will turn to the development and use of the equations of 
motion. It will be in these lectures that the text material will prove most 
useful. Our emphasis will not be onthe multitudeofinteresting(andless 
interesting) properties of the equations themselves, but on the use of what 
the equationstell usin orderto understand variousphenomena. Among the 
phenomena we will discuss are: 
1. The global distribution of surface easterly and westerly winds; 
2. Gravity waves and turbulence in the upper atmosphere; 
3. Atmospheric tides; 
4. The quasi-biennial oscillation of the stratosphere; 
5. Travelling and stationary weather systems; 
Dont worry if some of the above terms are unfamiliar to you. They will be 
explained in the remainder of these notes. 
The above discussions will emphasize physical concepts, with the hope 
thatinterested studentswilldelvefurtherintothe solutiondetails(insofar 
as they exist). Finally, formal problems are set at the end of each chapter, 
andinformalquestionsareproposed throughoutthetext. Dealing withboth 
is integral to learning the material. 
It should be noticed that the next four chapters do not even use the 
equations of motion. These are not, in fact, introduced until Chapter 6  
following the discussion of observations in Chapter 5. Some hydrostatics 
relevant to the atmosphere are introduced in Chapter 4, because they are 
essential to the discussion of observations. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with two 
problems where dynamics is essential, but where the role of dynamics can</text>

be delineated without specic reference to details. The hope in introducing 
the subject in this manner is to avoid the notion that dynamic meteorology 
is simply the derivation of equations and their subsequent solution. Rather, 
asthetitle of these notes suggests,dynamicsis a centralpart(but still only 
apart) of the total physics of the atmosphere. 
Finally,Ihope,through thisbook,tocommunicatetheobviousfactthat 
dynamic meteorology is not so much a body of canonical results, but rather 
an active research eld in a state of ux.</text>

Introductory remarks 
Motion is manifest in the atmosphere in an almost innite variety of ways 
includingwind chillfactors,anomalously cold winters,summerdroughts,and 
soforth. Weshallintheselecturessomewhatlooselydistinguishbetweenmo
tionsystemsthemselvesand thethingsmotionsystemsdo. Amotionsystem 
will be dened by the distributions in space and time of velocity, v; mean 
density, ;pressure, p;temperature, T ; and constituent densities, i.Exam
ples of what we will consider to be motion systems are cyclonic storms and 
stationaryplanetary scalepatterns. Thelatterareintimatelyassociated with 
anomalous seasonal weather patterns. Examples of things motion systems 
do are the reduction of the poleequator temperature dierences to about 
half of what wouldbeexpectedfrompurely radiativeconsiderations,and the 
creationof maximumcolumndensitiesof ozone athighlatitudesratherthan 
in the tropics as would have been expected on the basis of photochemical 
equilibrium. 
In attempting to discuss this topic in one semester, there is no hope of 
completeness. Moreover, any attempt to begin at the beginning will barely 
transcendthebeginningitself.Although somebackgroundinhydrodynamics 
is helpful, these lectures are formally self-contained. Also, from the begin
ning,wewilldeal with theintegrationofdynamicswith othercomponentsof 
atmospheric physics. Clearly, these lectures cannot be comprehensive. The 
use of additional references(Houghton,1977,Holton,2004,Pedlosky,1987, 
and Gill, 1982, Pedlosky, 2003) will be helpful though not essential.

1. Bothhydrostaticityandgeostrophy arestaticbalances. Itis,of course, 
slightly peculiar to refer to a force balance involving a moving uid 
as static. Nevertheless, as long as one refers to a centrifugal force, 
then geostrophy is a statement that two forces balance rather than a 
dynamic(prognostic) statement. 
2. Neither hydrostaticity nor geostrophy is causal relation. 
3. Strictly speaking, Equation 4.1 is true only in the absence of verti
cal acceleration(relativetothe already rotating system) andfriction. 
Equation 4.4 is always approximate. Nevertheless, for horizontal ac
celerations with time scales longer than a pendulum day (/) and 
vertical accelerations with time scales longer than the Brunt-Vaisala 
period3 (O(5minutes)),(4.1) and(4.4) remainvery nearly true. These 
conditions apply, for the most part, to the large-scale motions of the 
atmosphere and oceans(atleast away fromfrictionallayersatbound
aries). 
4. For motions in the atmosphere and oceans the appropriate choice for 
 is its vertical component. The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.3.

As we noticed in our perusal of the data, atmospheric elds are far from 
being zonally symmetric. Some of the deviation from symmetry is forced 
by theinhomogeneity ofthe earths surface, and someis autonomous(trav
elling cyclones, for example). The two are related; for example, the storm 
paths along which travelling cyclones travel are signicantly determined by 
the planetary scale waves forced by inhomogeneities in the earths surface. 
Nevertheless, the zonally averaged circulation has, over the centuries, been 
the object of special attention. Indeed, the term general circulation is fre
quently taken to mean the zonally averaged behavior. This is the viewpoint 
ofLorenz(1967). 
You are urged to read chapters 1,3, and 4 of Lorenz. Chapter 1 is a 
short and especiallyinsightfuldiscussion of the methodology of studying the 
atmosphere. As is generally the case in this eld, there will be views in

exists at all! Figures 5.10 and 5.11 show meridional sections of zonally av
eraged zonal wind and temperature for solstitial conditions. Within about 
2025 of the equator these elds are symmetric about the equator. Thus, in 
this region, at least, an average over winter and summer of these elds will 
still give the solstitial distributions. Finally, Figure 7.12 shows the monthly 
means of the meridional circulation for each of the twelve months of the 
year. This gure is a little hard to interpret since it extends to only 15S. 
However, to a signicant extent it suggests that except for the month of 
April,theasymmetricsolstitialpatternismorenearly characteristicof every 
month than is the idealized symmetric pattern invoked since Hadley in the 
eighteenth century. Clearly, the assumption of such symmetry is suspect. 
Some insight into what is going on can, interestingly enough, be got
ten from the simple equal area argument. This is shown in Lindzen and 
Hou(1988). We willbriey sketch their resultshere. They studiedthe axi
ally symmetric response to heating centered o the equator at some latitude 
0. Thus Equation 7.10 was replaced by 
E H  z 1 
0 
3 H 2 . (7.50) =1+ (13(sin sin0)2)+V 
Thefactthat 0 =0substantially complicatestheproblem. Nowthe north
ward and southward extending cells will be dierent. Although we still re
quirecontinuityof temperatureattheedgeof each cell,thenorthward extent 
of the Hadley circulation, H+, will no longer have the same magnitude as 
thesouthward extent, H. Moreover, the equal area argument must now 
be applied separately to the northern and southern cells. Recall that in the 
symmetric case, the requirement of continuity at H and the requirement 
of nonetheating(i.e., equal area) served todetermineboth H and (0), 
the temperature at the latitude separating the northern and southern cells 
 which for the symmetric case is the equator. In the present case, this sep
arating latitude can no longer be the equator. If we choose this latitude to 
be some arbitrary value, 1, then the application of temperature continuity 
and equal area for the northern cell will lead to a value of (1)that will, 
ingeneral,bedierentfromthe value obtainedby application of these same 
constraints to the southern cell. In order to come out with a unique value 
for 1 we must allow 1 to be a variable to be determined. 
The solution is now no longer obtainable analytically, and must be de
termined numerically. This is easily done with any straightforward search</text>

Now suppose that M has a local maximum somewhere in the uid. We 
may then nd a closed contour surrounding this point where M is constant. 
If weintegrate(7.23) aboutthiscontour,thecontributionoftheleft-hand 
sidewillgotozero(Why?),whilethecontributionof theright-hand sidewill 
benegative(duetodowngradientviscous uxes). Sincesuch asituationis 
inconsistent,M cannothaveamaximumintheinteriorof the uid. Wenext 
considerthepossibility that M has a maximum at the surface. We may now 
draw a constant M contour above the surface, and close the contour along 
the surface(where w = un = 0). Again, the contribution from the left-hand 
side will be zero. The contribution from the right-hand side will depend 
on the sign of the surface wind. If the surface wind is westerly, then the 
contribution of the right-hand side will again be negative, and M,therefore, 
cannot have a maximum at the surface where there are surface westerlies. If 
the surface winds are easterly, then there is, indeed, a possibility that the 
contributionfromtheright-hand sidewillbezero. Thus,themaximumvalue 
of M must occur at the surface in a region of surface easterlies1! An upper 
boundfor M is given by its value at the equator when u =0; thatis, 
Mmax &lt; a 2 . (7.24) 
Now uE asgivenby(7.19) implies(among otherthings) westerliesatthe 
equator and increasing M with height at the equator  all of which is for
biddenby Hidestheorematleastforsymmetriccirculations. A meridional 
circulation is needed in order to produce adherence to Hides theorem. 
Before proceeding to a description of this circulation we should recall 
that in our discussion of observations we did indeed nd zonally averaged 
westerliesabovethe equator(inconnectionwiththequasi-biennial oscilla
tion,forexample).Thisimpliestheexistenceof eddieswhich aretransporting 
angular momentum up the gradient of mean angular momentum! 
A clue to how much of a Hadley circulation is needed can be obtained 
by seeing where uE = uM;by uM we mean the value of u associated with 
M =a2 (viz Equation7.24). From(7.22) weget 
a sin2  uM = . (7.25) cos  
1It is left to the reader to show that M cannot have a maximum at a stress-free upper 
surface.</text>

(a) the meridional ow is primarily conned to thin boundary layers 
adjacent to the two horizontal boundaries, or that 
(b)proles of u and  are self-similar so that

In 1926, Jereys put forth an interesting and inuential criticism of all 
symmetric models as an explanation of midlatitude surface westerlies. He 
began with an equationfor zonal momentum(viz. Equation6.18): 
u u u u uv tan uw 
t + ux + vy + wz  a + a 
1p 1 = x +2v sin +2w cos  + (  )x. (7.1) 
Forthepurposes ofJereys argument,(7.1) canbe substantially simplied. 
Steadinessand zonal symmetry(noeddies)imply  =  =0. Scalingshows t x 
that 
uw uv tan , 2w cos   , 2v sin a a 
(What about the equator?). In addition, 
u uv tan vu uv tan v vy  a = a   a = a cos (u cos). 
Thus(7.1) becomes

Lorenz which are not universally agreed on, but this hardly diminishes its 
value. 
There are several reasons for focussing on the zonally averaged circula
tion: 
1. Signicant motion systems like the tropical tradewinds are well de
scribed by zonal averages. 
2. The circulation of the atmosphere is only a small perturbation on a 
rigidly rotating basic state which is zonally symmetric. 
3. The zonally averaged circulation is a convenient subset of the total 
circulation. 
Our approach in this chapter will be to inquire how the atmosphere 
would behave in the absence of eddies. It is hoped that a comparison of 
such resultswith observations willlend someinsightintowhat maintainsthe 
observed zonally averaged state. In particular, discrepancies may point to 
the role of eddies in maintaining the zonal average. This has been a matter 
of active controversy to the present. 
7.1 Historical review 
A very complete historical treatment of this subject is given in chapter 4 
of Lorenz. We will only present a limited sketch here. The rst treatment 
of contemporary relevance was that of Hadley (1735). Hadleys aim was 
to explainthe easterly(actually northeasterly intheNorthernHemisphere) 
tradewinds of the tropics and the prevailing westerlies of middle latitudes. 
Hisbrief explanationissummarizedinFigure7.1. IgnoringHadleyserrorin 
assuming conservation of velocity rather than angular momentum, Hadleys 
argument ran roughly as follows: 
1. Warm air rises at the equator and ows poleward at upper levels ap
proximatelyconserving angularmomentum.(Inviewof theremarksat 
the end of Chapter 6, it is not, however, at all obvious why one would 
have a meridional circulaton at all. We will discuss this later.) Be
cause the distance from the axis of rotation diminishes with increasing 
latitude, large westerly currents are produced at high latitudes.</text>

arguments as follows. They noted that at the latitude at which zonal ow 
is zero,there mustbe a maximuminpressure(Why?), andthat withinthe 
frictional layer next to the surface, a shallow ow will be established down 
pressure gradients leading to the reversed cell shown in Figure 7.2 (today 
referred to as a Ferrel cell). By allowing the Hadley circulation to remain 
at upper levels, the tropics can continue to supply midlatitudes with angular 
momentum whichpresumably is communicated totheFerrel cellby friction. 
Although there was a general acceptance of the Ferrel-Thomson model 
of the general circulation in the late nineteenth century, there was also a 
general uneasiness due to the obvious fact that the observed circulation was 
not zonally symmetric. Moreover, all the models we have discussed were 
developedinonly aqualitative,verbal way. Thisis,of course, not surprising

the edge of the Hadley circulation. The midlatitude tropopause somewhat 
articially reects the assumed E distribution. The elevated tropopause in 
the tropics results from the inclusion of cumulus heating. 
7.3.1 Remarks on cumulus convection 
Cumulusheating will notbedealt withintheselectures,butforthemoment 
threeproperties of cumulus convection shouldbe noted: 
1. It is, in practice, the primary mechanism for carrying heat from the 
surfaceinthetropics. 
2. Cumulus towers, for simple thermodynamic reasons, extend as high as 
16km, and appeartobethedeterminant ofthetropicaltropopause 
height and the level of Hadley outow. Remember that tropical cir
culations tend to wipe out horizontal gradients. Thus, the tropopause 
tends to be associated with the height of the deepest clouds. 
3. Cumulus convection actively maintains a dry static stability (as re
quired in the calculation of Hadley transport). This is explained in 
Sarachik(1985).

7.3.2 Preliminary summary 
On the basis of our study of symmetric circulations (so far) we nd the 
following: 
1. Symmetricsolutionsyield an upperleveljetinaboutthe rightplace 
but with much too large a magnitude. 
2. Symmetric circulations yield surface winds of the right sign in about 
therightplace. Intheabsenceof verticaldiusion,magnitudesaretoo 
small, but modest amounts of vertical diusion corrects matters, and 
cumuluscloudsmightprovidethis diusion. (SchneiderandLindzen, 
1976, discuss cumulus friction.)</text>

7.2.2 Simplied calculations 
SolvingfortheHadley circulationisnot simpleevenforthehighly simplied 
model of Held and Hou. However, Schneider and Held and Hou discovered 
that the solutions they ended up with when viscosity was low were approxi
mately constrained by a few principles which served to determine the main 
features of the Hadley circulation: 
1. The upper poleward branch conserves angular momentum; 
2. The zonal ow is balanced; and 
3. Surface winds are small compared to upper level winds. 
In addition: 
4. Thermal diusion is not of dominant importance in Equation 7.8. 
Held and Hou examine, in detail, the degree to which these principles 
are valid, and you are urged to read their work. However, here we shall 
merely examinetheimplicationsofitems(1)(4) and seehowthese compare 
with the numerical solutions from Held and Hou. 
Principle(1) implies 
a sin2  u(H,)= uM = . (7.29) cos  
2The choice H =1/3 is taken from Held and Hou (1980) and corresponds to E 
varying by about 100 between the equator and the poles. This, indeed, is reasonable 
for radiative equilibrium. However, more realistically, the atmosphere is, at any moment, 
more nearlyin equilibrium with the sea surface(because adjustmenttimesforthe sea are 
much longer than for the atmosphere) and, therefore, a choice of H 1/6 may be more 
appropriate. This leads to R1/2 .34 and  20, which is not too dierent from what 
was obtained for H =1/3. This relative insensitivity of the Hadley cell extent makes it 
afairlypoor variablefordistinguishing between variousparameter choices.</text>

(7.15)(7.19)cannot be a steady solution of the symmetric equations.

routine. Here we will merely present a few of the results. In Figure 7.13 
we show how H+, H, and 1 vary with 0 forH =1/3(correspond
ing to a poleequator temperature dierence in E of about 100C) and 
forH =1/6. The latter case corresponds to the atmosphere being ther
mally forced by the surface temperature, and is probably more appropriate 
for comparisons with observations. For either choice, we see that 1 goes 
to fairly large values for small values of 0. At the same time, H also 
grows to large values while H+ and 1 asymptotically approach each other 
 consistent with the northern cell becoming negligible in northern summer. 
Figure 7.14 shows and E versuslatitudefor 0 =0and 0 =6.Wesee 
very clearlythegreat enlargement andintensicationofthesoutherncell and 
the corresponding reduction of the northern cell that accompanies the small 
northward excursionof 0 (Recallthattheintensity of theHadley circulation 
isproportional to(E);viz Equation 7.42.). We see, moreover, that in 
agreement with observations at tropopause levels  is symmetric about the 
equator(atleastinthe neighbourhood ofthe equator). We also seethat 
has a signicant minimum at the equator; such a minimum is observed at 
thetropopause,butis not characteristic of  averaged over the depth of the 
troposphere. 
While the simple equal area argument seems to appropriately explain 
why the Hadley circulation usually consists in primarily a single cell trans
porting tropical air into the winter hemisphere, the picture it leads to is 
not withoutproblems. Figure7.15 shows u(H,)for 0 = .1andH =1/6. 
Consistent with observations, u(H,H+)ismuchweakerthan u(H,H)and 
u is symmetric about the equator in the neighbourhood of the equator, but 
u(H,H)is still much larger than the observed value, and now u(H, 0) in
dicates much stronger easterlies than are ever observed. Further diculties 
emerge when we look at the surface wind in Figure 7.16. We see that there 
isnow alowlevel easterlyjetonthe winterside ofthe equator;thisis,in 
fact, consistent with observations. However, the surface wind magnitudes 
(for 0 =6) are now excessive(onlypartlydueto thelinearization of the 
drag boundary condition), and, more ominously, there are surface westerlies 
at the equator in violation of Hides theorem. There are exercises where 
you are askedtodiscussthesediscrepancies. Lindzen andHou(1988) show 
that all these discrepancies disappear in a continuous numerical model with 
a small amount of viscosity. The discrepancies arise from the one overtly 
incorrect assumption in the simple approach: namely, that the angular mo
mentum on the upper branch of the Hadley circulation is characteristic of</text>

was the obvious lack of data to do otherwise. He then showed that this in
tegral was about a factor of 20 smaller than CD u02 . He concluded that the 
maintenance of the surface westerlies had to be achieved by the neglected 
eddies. It may seem odd that Jereys, who so carefully considered the eect 
of the return v-ow on the Coriolis torque, ignored it for the transport of 
relativemomentum. However,sinceit wastheFerrel cellhe wasthinking of, 
its inclusion would not have altered his conclusion. What he failed to note 
was that in both Hadleys model and that of Ferrel and Thomson, it was the 
Hadley cell which supplied westerly momentum to middle latitudes. Thus 
Jereys argument is totally inconclusive; it certainly is not a proof that 
a symmetric circulation would be impossible (though this was sometimes 
claimedintheliterature). 
Amorebalanced viewwaspresentedbyVillemBjerknes(1937) towards 
the end of his career. Bjerknes suggested that in the absence of eddies the 
atmosphere would have a Ferrel-Thomson circulation  but that such an at
mosphere would prove unstable to eddies. This suggestion did not, however, 
oer any estimate of the extent to which the symmetric circulation could 
explain the general circulation, and the extent to which eddies are essential. 
Ed Schneider and I attempted to answer this question by means of 
a rather cumbersome numerical calculation(SchneiderandLindzen,1977; 
Schneider, 1977). The results shown in Figure 7.3 largely conrm Bjerknes 
suggestion. The main shortcoming of this calculation was that it yielded a 
zonaljetthat was much too strong. Surface winds were also alittle weaker 
than observed, but on the whole, the symmetric circulation suered from 
none of the inabilities Jereys had attributed to it. In order to see how the 
symmetriccirculationworks,itisfortunatethatSchneider(1977) discovered 
a rather simple approximate approach to calculating the Hadley circulation.

7.3 Summary and diculties 
Beforesummarizing what all thistellsus aboutthegeneral circulationlet us

is by and large consistent with Held and Hous, also manages to predict an

can extend to the pole.) 
We see that continuity of potential temperature and conservation of 
angularmomentumandpotential temperatureservetodeterminethemerid
ional distribution of temperature. the intensity of the Hadley circulation 
will be such as to produce this temperature distribution. In section 10.2 
of Houghton, 1977, there is a description of Charneys viscosity dominated 
model for a meridional circulation. In that model,  = E and u = uE, 
exceptinthinboundary layers,and themeridional velocityisdeterminedby 
urequiring that fv balance the viscous diusion of momentum,

2 . Such a 
model clearly violates Hides theorem. A more realistic viscous model is de
scribedby SchneiderandLindzen(1977) andHeld andHou(1980), wherein 
the meridional circulation is allowed to modify  through the following lin
earization of the thermodynamic energy equation 
 w =(E)/, z 
where 
z  is a specied constant. In such models the meridional circulation 
continues, with gradual diminution, to high latitudes rather than ending 
abruptly at some subtropical latitude  as happens in the present almost 
inviscid model. On the other hand, the modication of  (for the linear 
viscous model) is restricted to a neighborhood of the equator given by 
 R1/4 , 
where

When R1/4 R1/2 (viz. Equation 7.28) then a viscous solution can be com
patible with Hides theorem. Note, however, that linear models cannot have 
surfacewinds(Why?Hint: considerthediscussionofJereys argument.).

(In what sense does Hadleys argument constitute an explanation?) 
The above model was generally accepted for over a century. The main 
criticism of this model was that it predicted northwesterly winds at midlat
itudes whereas nineteenth century data suggested southwesterly winds (in 
the Northern Hemisphere). This diculty was answered independently by 
Ferrel(1856) andThomson(1857). Theirhypothesized solutionis shownin

 = 1 (the latitude separatingthe northern and southern cells). As we saw 
inconnectionwith thesymmetricHadley circulation(i.e., 1 =0),theangu
lar momentum in the upper branch was actually characteristic of the entire 
ascending region. Thiswas not such a signicantissueinthesymmetriccase 
becausetheverticalvelocity wasamaximumat  = 1 = 0 =0.However, 
when 0 = 0, then the maximum ascent no longer occurs at 1; rather it 
occurs near 0 where the characteristic angular momentum diers greatly 
from that at 1. It should also be mentioned that in the continuous models, 
the temperature minimum at the equator is substantially diminished. 
The above discussion leads to only modest changes in the ve points 
mentioned in Section 7.3.2. Item 5 is largely taken care of when one recog
nizesthattheHadley circulationresultingfromaveraging winterand summer 
circulationsismuchlargerthanthecirculationproducedby equinoctialforc
ing. Eddies are probably still needed for the following: 
1. todiminish thestrength ofthejetstream,and,relatedly,tomaintain 
surface winds in middle and high latitudes; and 
2. to carry heat between the tropics and the poles. 
LindzenandHou(1988) stressthatHadley circulationsmainlytransport 
angular momentum into the winter hemisphere. Thus, to the extent that 
eddiesareduetotheinstability ofthejet,eddy transports arelikely tobe 
mostlypresentinthe winterhemisphere.

3. Calculated Hadley circulations have only a nite extent. In contrast 
to Hadleys and Ferrel and Thomsons diagnostic models, the upper 
branchdoes not extend tothepoles. Thus ourHadley circulationcan
not carry heat between the tropics and the poles, and cannot produce 
the observed poleequator temperature dierence.

7.4 Asymmetry about the equator 
Although wedo nothavethetimetopursuethis(and most other matters) 
adequately, the reader should be aware that critical reassessments are essen
tial tothescienticenterprise andfrequently thesourceof trulyimportant 
problems and results. What is wrong with our results is commonly more 
important than what is right! A particular shortcoming will be discussed 
here: namely, the assumption that annual average results can be explained 
with a model that is symmetric about the equator. The importance of this 
shortcominghasonly recentlybeenrecognized.(Thissectionislargelybased 
onthematerialinapaperbyLindzenandHou,1988.) Thisfactaloneshould 
encourage the reader to adopt a more careful and critical attitude. 
Whatisatissueinthesymmetryassumption canmost easilybeseenby 
looking at some data for the meridional circulation itself. Thus far we have 
not paid too much attention to this eld. Figure 7.11 shows the meridional 
circulation for solstitial conditions. Not surprisingly, it is not symmetric 
about the equator. More surprising, however, is the degree of asymmetry:

show much less wave structure  presumably due to the relative absence of 
land in the Southern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, what wave structure there 
is in the monthly means for the Southern Hemisphere is much the same 
in both amplitude and phase for both January and July. In the Northern 
Hemisphere,themonthly meanwavesweresignicantly strongerinJanuary. 
5.3 Zonal means 
5.3.1 Seasonal means 
As is evident from the preceding gures, maps display the superposition of 
many phenomena and systems. As such, they are dicult to analyze un
ambiguously. It is usual to process the maps in such a manner as to isolate 
some subset of what is going on. Taking monthly means is an example of 
such processing. Another example, of great historical importance in meteo
rology,isthetaking of zonal meansinordertostudy theheight andlatitude 
variationsof such means. Figures5.10 and5.11 showthemeridional sections

Northern Hemisphere continents there is often fairly dense coverage. Tem
poral coverage is barely adequate to resolve ve-day periods (one usually 
needs 46 points to resolve a period or wavelength), and height resolution, 
whileadequatefor somepurposes,is usuallyinadequatefortheresolution of 
boundary layerscommonly observed(in moredetailed measurements)below 
700mb. 
Thelimitationsimposedby thecrudenatureof ourmeteorological mea
surements are substantial  and real. Moreover, the raw data in tabular 
form(or anydigitalform) ispeculiarly uninformative. Indeed,if each sta
tion produced an independent uncorrelated time series, it would be dicult 
toknowwheretobeginany theoreticaldescription(tobesure,wecould then 
begin to formulate statistics, and attempt to explain these statistics), but, 
fortunately, when the data are presented in the form of global or regional 
maps, weseethatpatterns emergewhich seemto evolveinatraceableman
ner2 . It is, in the form of these maps, that we usually study the data. Such 
maps are the basis of much of this chapter. A quick glance at these maps 
shows representations which are continuous overthewholeglobe(or atleast 
ahemisphere),whilethe raw datacomefromarelativelyfewisolated sta
tions. Clearly,themapsarenot exactlydata; theyincludeavery substantial 
amount of interpolation  and this interpolation is rarely as straightforward 
as simple linear interpolation. Such maps are referred to as analyzed data. 
When the analysis is performed by hand by a synoptic meteorologist, it is 
referred to as subjective analysis. The contours drawn in data-free regions 
probably contain useful information  especially when prepared by an expe
rienced meteorologist  since much is known about the expected time and 
space evolution of disturbances. However, there is no getting away from the 
fact that what is drawn is not data. This becomes particularly disturbing 
when the contours show substantial detail in data-free regions. In general, 
these details will dier in dierent analyses. 
Whentheanalysisisperformed according to xed rulesand algorithms, 
the analysis is referred to as objective. The advantage of objective analy
sesistheir reproducibility,butthereis no other apriori guaranty ofgreater 
accuracy than that found in subjective analyses. Recently, it has become 
commonto analyzedata with the aid of numerical weatherprediction mod

usually useless. Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of radiosonde stations 
at which conventional meteorological balloon soundings are taken at least 
oncedaily(andfrequently twicedaily at0000Z and1200Z). These sound
ings consistinpressure,temperature,andhumidity measurementstransmit
ted by small radio transmitters to the ground. In addition, the balloons are 
tracked by radar in order to obtain proles of horizontal wind. In princi
ple, such data are available with fairly high vertical resolution (O(1km)), 
but usually the archived data sets list data only for a subset of the stan
dardlevels(surface,1000mb,850mb,700mb,500mb,400mb,300mb,250mb, 
200mb,150mb,100mb,50mb,30mb,20mb,10mb)1 . From Figure 5.1 we see 
that the horizontal distribution of stations  especially over the oceans and 
in the Southern Hemisphere  is inadequate to resolve any but the coarsest 
of features. The coverage, however, is extremely nonuniform, and over the

are supposed to be recorded as signicantlevels. Unfortunately data sets frequently omit 
some of these levels.</text>

els. Iterative use of predictions over short periods allows one to interpo
late the raw data in a manner which is somehow consistent with the model 
physics. Moreover, such schemes allow the assimilation of data other than 
the standard radiosonde data obtained from the stations in Figure 5.1. Of 
primary importance in this regard is the satellite obtained infrared radi
ance (from which coarse vertical temperature structure may be inferred)3 , 
and winds obtained from jumbo jets with accurate inertial guidance sys
tems. Such model based analysis-assimilation schemes are impressive. Tests 
show that the interpolations are frequently surprisingly accurate. There is a 
general consensus that these new objective analyses are consideraby better 
than older subjective analyses  especially over the oceans. However, even 
these analyses are limited by (among other things) the model physics and 
resolution. Ingeneral, such modelshaveonlyprimitiveparameterizationsof 
cumulus convection, turbulence, radiative transfer, and sub-grid transfers by 
gravity waves. The forecast skill of such models is frequently poor in the 
tropics. Analysis-assimilation schemes which emphasize compatibility with 
the model physics often throw away actual data in order to produce a com
patible analysis. Moreover, analyses based on dierent models frequently 
dier substantially(Lau andOort,1981). 
The above description may be unduly critical. Nevertheless, there can 
benodoubtthatthecomparisonof theory anddataisamoredicultpropo
sition in meteorology than in the traditional sciences. Science consists in a 
creative tension between theory and data: theory explaining data  data 
testing theory. In each case, the data consists in numbers with error bars 
estimatingthelikely uncertainty ofthedata. Sucherrorbarscanbeattached 
to the results of individual soundings, but no similar methodology is read
ily attached to analyzed data where whole weather systems may be missed 
while occasionally systems are drawn which in reality didnt exist. The sit
uation becomes even more questionable when higher levels of analysis are 
introduced: that is, spectral decompositions, correlations, etc. While such 
analyses might be applied, in principle, to the raw data, the methods are 
far better suited to regularly spaced data. In general, such regularly spaced,

greatlyimproveglobalforecastsand analyses. This,infact,hasproventobethecasein 
the Southern Hemisphere, where there is almost no other data. However, in the Northern 
Hemisphere little or no improvement has been obtained. Apparently, inaccuracies and 
poor vertical resolution have limited the impact of satellite data when other data are 
available.</text>

gridded data are obtained from analyzed maps. In this chapter, we will 
avoid such products of higher level analyses  though the results can often 
be informative and suggestive. 
At this point it might appear that analyzed data is completely uncer
tain. This is certainly untrue  even though the quantitative measures of 
uncertaintyhavenotbeenadequatelydeveloped.Certainimportantfeatures 
on maps appear regularly and clearly(high signaltonoise ratio) and are 
readily related to our tangible experience of weather. Analyzed data do, in 
fact,help ustoisolateandquantify suchfeatures. However,data asusedin 
meteorology are not quite so concrete as carefully obtained laboratory data 
 and may, on occasion, even be wrong! 
In describing the largescale structure of the atmosphere, I will assume 
that the reader is already familiar with the variation of the horizontally 
averaged temperature with height. Similarly, the reader should be familiar 
with the typical heights at which various pressures occur. Finally, more 
detailed examination of the data for specic phenomena will be made in 
some later chapters. 
5.2 Daily and monthly maps 
We begin our study with eight gures, each of which consists of a set of 
four hemispheric maps: one for January 15, 1983, one for July 16, 1983, one 
for the average over January 1983, and one for the average over July 1983. 
The maps are all from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather 
Forecasting(ECMWF). Figures5.2 and5.6 showpressure contours at sea 
level(correctedfortopography) fortheNorthernandSouthernHemispheres, 
respectively.Figures5.35.5 showheight eldsfor500mb,300mb,and50mb 
in the Northern Hemisphere while Figures 5.75.9 show the same for the 
SouthernHemisphere. 
Such mapsdisplay manyphenomena thoughthemapspresentedhere 
are insucient to adequately isolate and quantitatively delineate such phe
nomena. Nevertheless, the maps warrant close and thoughtful scrutiny. In 
thesenotes,wewillfocusontheNorthernHemispheremaps and eventhat 
willbedonebriey,simplyindicating thekindsof things one mightlookfor. 
The reader should carefully study the Southern Hemisphere maps in order 
to see in what ways the meteorology of the Southern Hemisphere resembles 
anddiersfromthatintheNorthernHemisphere.</text>

Figure5.2 showsmapsofNorthernHemispheresealevelpressure. Note, 
for example, the following: 
1. Daily maps show more ne-scale structure than do monthly means 
implyingthat ne-scale structure is associated with shorter time scales 
than a month. 
2. The intensity of structures is greater in winter than in summer. 
3. Note the large-scale lows over the oceans and highs over land in the 
January mean. Note the reversal of this pattern in the July mean. 
InFigure5.3,whichshowsheight contoursat500mb,notethefollowing: 
1. Again note the loss of ne-scale structure in the monthly means. 
2. Fine-scalestructure(especiallyforJanuary 15) tendstobelessassoci
ated with closed contoursthaninFigure5.2. Thisis not becausethese 
features are weaker at 500mb; rather, it is due to the stronger mean 
zonal4 ow at 500mb5 . 
3. Again features are less intense in summer than in winter. 
4. Notice that in contrast to the results at the surface, the phase of the 
waves in the monthly mean maps is much the same in both January 
andJuly. 
Turning to Figure 5.4, which shows height contours at 300mb, we see a 
rather substantial similaritytoFigure5.3 exceptforageneralintensication 
ofthezonal mean owandtheeddies(deviationsfromthezonal mean). 
In moving to Figure 5.5, which shows height contours at 50mb, from 
Figure 5.4, we are moving across the tropopause. We now see a close simi
larity between the daily maps and the monthly means indicating a relative 
absence of short-period features. We also see an increase in the dominant 
spatial scale. In the summer we see a pronounced reduction in both eddies 
and the zonal mean. 
The readercan conrmfromFigures5.6-5.9 thepresenceof most of the 
above features in the Southern Hemisphere. However, the monthly means

5.3.5 Stratospheric sudden warmings 
Figures 5.5 and 5.16 suggest a rather regular seasonal behaviour in the mid
dle andhighlatitudestratosphere. However,occasionally(every14years 
orso)intheNorthernHemispherethispatternbreaksdownratherspectacu
larly in a midwinter stratospheric sudden warming wherethe winterpattern 
breaks down and a summer pattern onsets  during the winter polar night. 
Figure 5.20 shows a Northern Hemisphere 
mapforJanuary25,1957 justpriortotheonsetofsuch awarming. The 
pattern is almost identical to that in Figure 5.5. (Note that North America 
is atthebottom ofFigure5.20, whileitisattheleftinFigure5.5; note also 
that height in Figure 5.20 is in 100s of feet while in Figure 5.5 it is in tens 
of meters.) However, by February 4, 1957, Figure 5.21 shows a signicant 
change: zonal wavenumber two has amplied strongly and seems to have 
drifted westward. This change is accompanied by a zonally averaged pole
wardheatuxwhichleadstothezonally averaged changesinzonal owand 
temperature shown in Figure 5.22. Observe the change of the temperature 
minimum at the pole into a temperature maximum. Note also the change 
from Arctic westerlies to easterlies. 
5.4 Short period phenomena 
Finally we return briey to our initial comment on the omission of shorter 
scale phenomena. It is increasingly recognized that some of these phenom
ena,intheform of verticallypropagating waves,play an essential roleinthe 
large scale circulation. This will be discussed in later chapters. Such waves 
have been long noticed in rocket data, examples of which are shown in Fig
ure5.23. Noticethelarge amplitudeperturbations(20C) with vertical 
wavelengths of from 1015km. These perturbations tend to become obvious 
at lower altitudes in winter. Rocket data for daynight temperature dier
ences are also of some interest. Examples are shown in Figure 5.24. What 
stands out in these gures is the very large daynight dierences observed 
in the upper mesosphere (O(20C)) and the fact that as often as not, the 
night is warmer. The reader should consider what this implies about how 
the atmosphere behaves  and, in particular, how the atmosphere knows 
when it is day or night. The implications are by no means restricted to the 
upper atmosphere.</text>

values about double the zonal average may be found at some longitudes. 
ThisisalsoseeninFigure5.15, whereNorthernHemispherewintercontours 
of zonal wind at 200mb are shown. Also, as already noted in the beginning 
of this chapter, the data we are dealing with are analyzed data. Figure 5.15 
showsthe resultsof twodierent analyses(GFDL andNMC) and thedier
ences between the two analyses. The dierences are on the order of 1020%, 
which is a plausible measure of our uncertainty. 
5.3.3 Middle atmosphere 
Sofarwehaveconcentratedourattentiononthezonally averaged zonal wind 
and temperature in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. Figure 5.16 
shows these quantities up to the lower thermosphere. The data is primarily 
Northern Hemisphere data; the right and left halves of the sections corre
spond to winter and summer. Note the monsoonal nature of the mesospheric 
winds: winterischaracterizedby westerlies; summerby easterlies. Notealso 
that temperature increases monotonically from the winter pole to the sum
mer pole at the stratopause (ca. 50km), but at the mesopause (ca. 83km) 
the temperature is increasing monotonically from the summer pole to the 
winter pole. This is again consistent with thermal wind balance. 
5.3.4 Quasi-biennial and semiannual oscillations 
Figure5.16 assumesthat stratosphericand mesosphericwindsaredominated 
by an annual (12 month) cycle. Near the equator this turns out to be un
true. Figure5.17 shows atime-height sectionof zonal wind atCantonIsland 
(246S)(whichturns outtobe characteristicofthe zonal average). Note 
that zonal winds form a downward propagating wave-like structure with a 
period of about 26 months; this is referred to as the quasi-biennial oscilla
tion whichdominatesthetropical zonal windbetween16km and30km. The 
situation up to 56km is shown in Figure 5.18. Here we see that above about 
32km, a semiannual oscillation isdominant. Figures5.17 and5.18 arebased 
on monthly means. It turns out that stratospheric tropical zonal winds also 
sometimesdisplay important shortperiod oscillations. InFigure5.19 we see 
an oscillation with aperiod of about12days. Thishasbeenidentied as an 
equatorial Kelvin wave6 .

The following are a few of the features which may be noted in these 
gures: 
1. Regardless of season, surface windstend tobe easterly(fromthe east) 
within30 of the equator and westerly poleward of 30. Surface east
erlies tend to be stronger on the winter side of the equator. 
2. The midlatitudetroposphereis characterizedby westerlyjetsinboth 
hemispheres.Thejetmaximaoccurat about12kmaltitude(200mb). 
The winter maximaare stronger(3050m/s) and occur near 30 
latitude. The summer maxima are weaker and occur further poleward 
(45 latitude). 
3. Inthe winter stratosphere,thereis also apolar night westerlyjet cen
tered near 60. This jet is generally stronger in the Southern Hemi
sphere winter. It also lasts longer there. What might be going on? 
4. Zonally averaged zonal winds and temperatures are pretty nearly in 
thermal wind balance. Thus, below 12km, where westerly ow is in
creasing with altitude,temperaturesaredecreasing awayfromtheequa
tor. However, above 12km, where westerly winds are decreasing with 
height, we have minimum temperatures at the 
equator. In the summer hemisphere, temperatures increase monoton
ically to the pole. However, in the winter hemisphere, a temperature 
maximum is reached in the lower stratosphere near 50 and the tem
perature falls rapidly poleward of this latitude (consistent with the 
presence of thepolar nightjet). 
Figure 5.12 shows the wintersummer dierences in zonally averaged 
temperature(takenfromNewell et al., 1972). Not surprisingly, these dier
ences are small in the tropics and large at high latitudes. Notice as well the 
dierences between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (Why?). 
5.3.2 Zonal inhomogeneity and role of analysis 
The zonal wind at any given longitude will, of course, dier from the zonal 
average. DecemberFebruary sections for various longitudes are shown in 
Figure 5.13; JuneAugust sections are shown in Figure 5.14. Inhomogeneity

5.1 General remarks 
Our introduction to the observed state of motion and temperature in the 
atmosphere will be restricted (for the most part) to fairly gross features. 
Almost no mention will be made of the numerous features most closely as
sociated with the most common perceptions of weather: hurricanes, fronts, 
thunderstorms, tornadoes, and clear air turbulence, to name a few. While 
thereissomethingperhapsparadoxical and certainly regrettableaboutthese 
omissions,theamount ofdetail requiredtocoverthemwouldfarexceedboth 
our time and our capacity for absorption of information. There is an addi
tional reasonforrestricting ourselvestolarger(synoptic) scales: namely,the 
conventional upper air data network does not resolve the smaller scales. 
The question of resolution is not a simple one and before proceeding, 
a few remarks on the nature of meteorological data are in order. Data, in 
the sense usedby experimental sciences(namely,single measurementsof an

R is known as the Rossby radius. 
12.3.2 Rossby number expansion

12.2	Vorticity in the shallow water

Let us rst consider the shallow water equations introduced in Chapter 4. 
This time, however, we will consider the nonlinear shallow water equations.

t = p, (12.1) 
where  = const. Taking the curl of(12.1) eliminates p and leaves us with 
 
t(u)=0. (12.2) 
In this quasi-uid u could be considered as conserved. u is called 
vorticity. Vorticity can be interpreted as twice the instantaneous local rota
tion rate of an element of uid. This is easily seen in two-dimensional ow. 
With reference to Figure 12.1,

12.1 Preliminary remarks 
In the preceding chapter we saw that  plays a major role in large-scale 
motions of the atmosphere. We also referred to  as the gradient of that 
contribution to a uids vorticity due to the Earths rotation. We will now 
briey consider what exactly is vorticity. 
Recallthatinparticlemechanics,conservationofenergy and momentum 
both play important roles. In a uid, however, momentum is not in general 
conserved because of the presence of pressure forces. To be sure, in sym
metriccirculations,zonal angular momentumisconserved(inthe absenceof 
friction), but then p = 0 by denition. The question we will consider is x 
whether there is anything a uid conserves instead of momentum. 
12.1.1 Interpretation of vorticity

Equation12.5becomes 
 u =0 (12.13) 
which implies the existence of a stream function such that 
u = y (12.14) 
v = x. (12.15) 
12.2.1 Filtered Rossby waves 
If we assume a constant basic ow, uo,andlinearizableperturbationsonthis

 + u0 (2 + f)+x =0. (12.16) t x 
If we assume further that the perturbations are of the form

then(12.16) becomes 
ik(u0 c)(k2 2) + ik =0 
or 
 c = u0  , (12.17) k2 + 2 
whichissimplytheequationfornon-divergentRossby waves.Themechanism 
of such wavesisshowninFigure12.2. Recall that a consistsinboth relative

which is precisely the dispersion relation for divergent Rossby waves1 . We 
seemtohavefound away of exploitinggeostrophy tosuppressgravity waves 
while retaining the time evolution associated with Rossby waves. Our next 
step is to make this procedure systematic. 
12.3	Quasi-geostrophic shallow 
water theory 
Once one knows what one is after, scaling aords a convenient way to make 
things systematic. It will become transparently clear that if one does not 
know what one wants apriori, scaling is not nearly so eective! 
1Note that in the non-divergent case, we automatically have a streamfunction, so that 
thereis no needfor aquasi-geostrophic approximationin orderto obtain(12.17). Equiv
alently, the non-divergent case does not have surface gravity waves to lter out.</text>

not enterourequations at eitherzeroth or rst orderin ,andEquations12.44 
and 12.45 are essentially identical to our shallow water equations for u and 
v. Thus at zeroth order 
f0vG = x (12.49) 
f0uG = x (12.50) 
(wheref = f0 + y). Similarly, to rst order

(N.B. we are retainingdimensional variables.) 
Equation 12.46 relates w to 
u1 v1 + . x y 
Equation12.47 allows usto rewrite(12.48) as

(ii)The approximate validity of geostrophy;
(iii)The small excursions of f from its mean value.
Item(ii) leadstotaking 
H fU = g L 
or 
fUL H = . (12.26) g 
Item(i) leadsto ourtaking 
U R0 = fL 1 (12.27) 
and 
1 R0T = fT 1. (12.28) 
For simplicity we will take 
R0 = R0T = . (12.29) 
Item(iii) leads usto write 
L = . (12.30) f 
We may now rewrite(12.26) as 
f2L2 
H = , g
