machine by Forbes. Inc. magazine ranked him #8 among entrepreneurs in the United States, calling him the rightful heir to Thomas Edison, and PBS include d Ray as one of 16 revol utionaries who made Am erica, along with other 
inventors of the past two centuries. Al ong with Larry Page, Ray de vised the solar-based ener gy plan for the recent 
"Grand Challenges in Engineering" blue ribbon panel of the National Academy of Engineering. 
Dr. George Church
George Church is Professor of Gene tics at Harvard Medical School and Direct or of the Center for Computational 
Genetics. With degrees from Duke University in Chemistry and Zoology, he co-authored research on 3D-software &amp; 
RNA structure with Sung-Hou Kim. His PhD from Harvard in Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology with Wally Gilbert 
included the first direct genomic sequencing method in 198 4. George is a co-founder of  LS9, Inc., an industrial 
biotechnology company developing biofuels ma de with the power of synthetic biology. 
Dr. Saul GriffithSaul Griffith has multiple degrees in materials science and mechanical engineering and completed his PhD in 
Programmable Assembly and Se lf Replicating machines at MIT. He is  the co-founder of numerous companies 
including: Low Cost Eyeglasses, Squid Labs, Potenco, Instructables.com, HowToons and Makani Power, which is 
seeking to harness clean energy from hi gh-altitude wind. Saul has r eceived several awards for invention, including the 
Collegiate Inventor's award, the Lemelson-MIT Student prize, and th e National Inventors Hall of Fame.X PRIZE Energy Forum

          <text>Spanish Longitude Prize (1567) Philip II of Spain offered a prize for the discovery of a method of find 
longitude at sea. In 1598, King Ph ilip III of Spain increased the pr ize. By one account, the prize was 
6000 gold ducats plus a pension of  2000 ducats a year for life.
The Dutch Longitude Prize (1627) Promised by the States General of the United Provinces of the 
Netherlands to anyone who could find a correct method of determin ing longitude. Reports vary on the 
amounts offered by the prize.
British Longitude Prize (1714)Meslay Prize (1714) French parliamentarian Rouill de Meslay bequeathed a fund of 125,000 livres for 
two prizes to be administered by the French Academie des Sciences. On e of the prizes was to determine 
longitude at sea and disc overies useful to navigation and long-distance voyages. According to one 
account, the Acadmie made the first navigation award-a substant ial 2,000 livres-in 1720, and it 
continued to pose research questions and award the Meslay prize into the 1780s.144 2,000 livres was 
roughly equivalent to four year s of wages for a skilled worker.Longitude

Decision-MakingCentralized DispersedBenefits Risks
Limit intellectual property leakage

competitive advantage by 
controlling the amount of 
information in the public domain
Better management of 
manipulation riskDecision may not represent most 
compelling value propositions 
Participants lose interest because 
they feel disengaged from the brand; de-motivated stakeholders 
may leave the network
Benefits Risks
Shift the costs of making a 
decision to external parties; 
decision represents democratic 
choice by the stakeholdersProvides a rationale for balancing 
interests of different stakeholdersCould engender more engagement 
and greater participationCould generate more creative 
ideas as participants build on ideas of othersPotential for leakage of intellectual

TRADE-OFFS
Benefits Risks
To Participants : Satisfaction that 
voice is heard; opportunities for self 
expression, recognition and fame; 
sense of community and altruism; engagement with community
To Company:
Engagement with 
the brand; potential to attract a diverse group of participantsHard to sustain interest and 
momentumWith potential thinning of the 
network could lead to diminished 
value and manipulation 
Many commercially valuable ideas 
may not be offeredBenefits Risks
To Participant : Financial gain; 
opportunities for recognition and fame 
To Company
: Potential to draw 
large numbers of participants; alignment of the stakeholders incentives with that of the firms; 
increase in creativity due to the 
incentives to win a prize in a race
or contestCollaboration benefits could get 
compromised by excessive competitiveness
Potentially brings concerns about 
intellectual property  rights, fairness, 
etc. to the forefrontLess engagement with the brand
Diminished focus on broader 
objectives e.g. social, 
environmental and political issues

          <text>6ENTHUSIASM FOR OPEN INNOVATION IS DRIVEN BY MULTIPLE 
FACTORS
Productivity
+
Cost
AdvantagesWhen companies look outside their own boundaries, they may ga in better access 
to ideas, knowledge, talent, technology or marketing capabilities than they would 
have if they relied sole ly on their own resources.  This can potentially enhance 
productivity or lower costs
Added 
BenefitsOpenness confers other benefi ts, e.g. faster time-to-market, hedging risk, 
motivating and developing internal resources, sending  a signal to the market, 
brand-building, building st akeholder support, etc.
Leveraging
Macro-
TrendsSeveral macro-trends provide  added impetus: challenges to centralized decision-
making in companies with  complex and globally dispersed operations; new 
technologies and new community behaviors favor co-creation mindsets; success of 
platform-oriented business models have shown compani es how to profit from the 
creativity and ent repreneurship of others.
Opportunity 
Created by 
the CrisisAs established companies freeze or cut their interna l R&amp;D, product development 
and marketing budgets and as the IPO ma rket remains virt ually dormant, open 
innovation provides opportuni ties for established players  to leverage free-standing 
entrepreneurs and other external  parties and for the latter  to get fund ing and explore 
exit opportunities</text>
