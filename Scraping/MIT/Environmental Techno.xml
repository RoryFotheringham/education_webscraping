          <text>Static vs. Dynamic Shading
Building does not require/allow for user intervention.
Architectural perception of exterior movable shading devices is that they look 
messy (Lam), are complicated to  maintain, subject to freezing rain (climate dependant).
Movable shading devices
 (venetian blinds) offer a dynamic response to a dynamic signal.
Trees and other vegetation can function as a compromise.
Dynamic shading devices are risky because occupant responses are difficult to predict.

New Approach:  Break shading volumes / surfaces 
into small pixels, and assess the thermal value of one pixel at a time. 
For speed, we run one thermal simulation of the 
space without shading, and then cast solar rays to 
find all hours during which a pixel casts direct shade on a window.  Based on loads and transmitted solar gains at those hours, the pixel is given credit for reducing cooling or punished for increasing heating.

Your household uses 160 lat65oCof hot water per day(or 40 l/person of which
50% are for showers/baths and 25% for dishwashing and laundry, respectively) .
Thecitys main cold water enters the house at 10oC.Youwant toknow how large
asolar hot water collector would have tobetocover the hot water energy demand
for the family on an average June day . Assume a collector efficiency of 85%.
The thermal heat required toheat 160 lof water from
10oCto65oCis:
Q =TMxTwithTM=Volume x SVH x 
TM=160l x 0. 001m3/lx4181 J/kgKx997 kg/m3
=667kJ/K
Q =667kJ/K x 55K = 36682 kJ = 10.2 kWh
The required collector area, Acollector ,is:
Acollector =10.2 kWh/( 0.85xG)
=10.2 kWh/( 0.85x133 kWh/m2x 1/30)
=2.7 m2

          <text>Feed In Tariffs vs. Net Metering
Net Energy Metering (NEM) is
predominantly favored in the
USA.
Exported electricity iscompensated at the retail price.
There will only be an economicincentive to store solar electricityif it occurs at times with lowprices.Feed In Tariffs (FITs) arepredominantly favoured in Europeanelectricity markets (i.e. Germany, 12euro cents/kWh in 2014, UK 5pence/kWh).
Exported electricity is compensatedat  a fixed export rate (usually lower
than retail electricity prices).
Money is made by owner by usingones own electricity rather thanbuying expensive electricity from thegrid.

For an electric water heater with an efficiency of 90% and an electricity 
cost of 0.186 $/kWh, the related costs are = $768/yr. 
Assuming that the solar thermal system covers 85% of your domestic 
hot water energy needs and that you get 30% Federal Government 
s
ubsidies for the system, the payback time is ($4152 x (1-0.3))/(768$/yr 
x 0.85) = 4.5yr. 
Why do we not see solar thermal system s 
in New England?  However, for a gas-fired DHW system at an efficiency of 80% and a 
cost of 0.035 $/kWh, the related costs are = $163/yr. 
Assuming  that the solar thermal system covers 85% of your domestic  
hot water energy needs, the payback time is  ($4152 x  (1-0.3))/(1 63 $/yr 
x 0.85)  = 21 yr

Keep luminance in the field of view within a factor of 3 / 10 within the near / far field vision.
Rule widely used but not validated.
Very difficult to maintain with daylight. Might not be necessary.
Combine with an upper luminance level of 2500 to 3000 cdm-2 due to glare

Photopic (Daytime Vision): The cones  of t he eye are of three different types
representing the thr ee primary colors, red, green and blue (&gt;3 cd/m2).
Scotopic (Night Vision): The rods are responsible for night and peripheral vision (&lt;
0.001 cd/m2).
Mesopic
 (Dim Light  Vision): occurs w hen the light levels  are low but one can still
see color (betw een 0.001 and 3 cd/m2).

A considerable part of the sunlight that enters the Earths atmosphere is scattered/reflected off 
clouds, aerosols, air molecules, and  water vapor  before it hits the Earths surface. This  part is responsible 
for the blue sky and is called diffuse daylight.

Theintroduction of a standard ti mefacilitates long distance travel andcommunication .
A disadvantage ofusing standar dt imeisthat our experience of time isnot directly linked to
theposition of the sunanymore .
Before the introduction of standard tim eintheUSin1883, different versions of solar time
were used instead .
Intrue solar time itisnoon exact lywhen the sunislocated tothe south (azimuth angle equals
zero) .
Solar time Boston isabout 11minu t esahead ofsolar time New York since both cities have
different longitudes.

A Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) is defined as a set of real measured hourly values for dry temperature, for 
global, diffuse, and direct normal solar radiation, and for wind velocity. The data are in true sequence within 
each month. T
he most important input variables are:
Dry Bulb Temperature [ C]
Relative Humidity [%]
Direct &amp; Diffuse Solar Radiation [W/m]
Wind Speed &amp; Direction [km/h]
Note:  Many simulations find TMY not stringent enough to meaningfully test the
performance of a building under extreme weather conditions such as heat waves.
 There is a new set of weather data for the US every 12 years. We are currently at
TMY3.
 Weather data will change due to climate change .

On a microscopic scale, temperature can be defined as the average energy in each degree of freedom in the particles 
in a system.

          <text>A psychrometric chart is a graph of the physical properties of moist air at a constant pressure (usually at sea level).
The value of the psychrometric chart is the fact that if two independent properties of a given unit of moist air are known, other key
physical properties can be determined.
The psychometric chart is the HVAC engineers, bioclimatic architects best friend.Psychrometric Chart

          <text>Relative Humidity
Relative Humidity (RH) is the ratio of the mole fraction of water 
vapor to the mole fraction of saturated moist air at the same 
temperature and pressure. RH is usually expressed as a percentage. 
Absolute Humidity is the proportion of mass of water vapor per 
unit mass of dry air. AH is dimensionless, but is sometimes expressed as grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). 
RH can be measured using a swing psychrometer. Modern 
sensors rely on resistive sensors (a polymer membrane 
whose resistance changes with temperature and RH).

          <text>Building Integrated Wind Power
Becton Center, Yale University
It is generally difficult to predict the electricity gains from building integrated wind turbines due to unknown and
complicated/turbulent local wind patterns.
Other concerns associated with this technology are economy of scale issues (small wind turbine versus large ones) and well as
noise and structural stress cause by these systemsAt the building level PV is comparable in price but at less maintenance cost and disturbance.

The wet -bulb temperature is the temperature of an air sample after it has passed 
through a constant -pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation process . In practice, this is 
the reading of a thermometer whose sensing bulb is covered with a wet sock 
evaporating into a rapid stream of the sample air. 
The WBT is the same as the DBT when the air sample is saturated with water.

Commercial turbine have a rated capacity fro m 0.5 to 8 MW at a diameter 30 m to 150 m and a hub height
of 220 m.
Residential turbines have a rated capacity under 30 kW, rotor diameters of  1 m to 15 m and a hub height
up to 40 m.
Total annual energy yield depends on a sites capacity factor w hich is usually in the 15% to 20% range.2 MW rated capacity | $3 -4 million installed  10 kW rated capacity | $50,000 -$80,000

 We are cooling from h1 to h2 and heating from h2 to h3.
 h2  h1= 23 BTU/lb - 32 BTU/ lb = - 9 BTU/lb ~ -29 kJ/kg (negative for cooling)
 h3  h2= 27.5 BTU/lb  23 BTU/lb = 4.5 BTU/lb ~ 10 kJ/kg (positive for heating)
 The load is ~2/3 latent and 1/3 sensible.
 Please note that for this example we ignored internal loads.

          <text>Ballasts perform three main functions:
They start the la mp.
They take  
the line voltage (120/240/277/480) and step it up or down as required by the
lamp.
They make sure that the lamp operates in stable mode by regulating the current.
Balla
sts ca
n be electromagnetic (heavy coils) or electronic (lightweight and high frequency).
The Uniqueness Rule
Ballasts are made specifically for the lamp they are designed to operate.  You cannot simply replace a lamp
with a diffe
rent type without changing the ballast.  Since it regulates the voltage it is designed for a specific
lamp type and wattage.Ballasts

Define work plane sensors that define where the occupants are usually located.
Associate sensors with  shading groups. A shading group consists of a (set of) blinds that are opened and lowered
at the same 
time.
Check when direct sunlight (&gt;50 Wm-2) is incident on a work plan sensor.
Close shading device if yes until occupant is away for more than an hour.

          <text>Is a widely used performance  metric  to describe the energy performance of a building.  It is defined as the annual
site energy use of a building divided  by its  floor area. It is expressed in kWh/m2yr or kBTU/ft2yr with  1 kWh/m2yr =
317 BTU/ft2yr
When applied to a building that uses electricity and gas, adding energy use for gas  and electricity is
literally mixing apples and oranges.
By
 normalizing energy use by building size, the goal is to compare the  energy performance of different
buildings.
 This works best for buildings of comparable size, with similar programs  and in related clim ates.
EUI is a measure of how efficiently a space is  thermally conditioned (heated and cooled) and lit. It is not a
measure of the  efficiency of  the building program. In fact,  having a spatially inefficient  program with
occupants and equipment spread  over a  larger area  can reduce  the EUI of a building.Energy Use Intensity (EUI)

developing an environmental concept  for a building, the design team should  early on agree upon  what type of 
building they aim to design.
oSustainable: most comprehensive  as it addresses societal, economic, and environmental concerns.
oGreen: includes operational energy use, embodied  energy use,  on site resource management, and 
occupancy well-b eing
oNet
 zero energy: concentrates on balanced use and generation  of energy (differences  exist as to 
whether energy has to be generated on-site or  off-s ite and whether the cost for energy or primary  
energy should be considered . Embodied energy of  the building structure is sometimes considered as 
well.) Terminology

Rule of thumb: The size of a heating and cooling  unit  depends on the size of the space to be cooled and very 
roughly corresponds to the following:  
Heating unit capa city (mild climate ) = 30 BTU x floor area in feet

Occupants of LEED certied buildings are equally satisfied with the building overall and with the workspace as occupants of non-
LEED buildings are.
Occupants of LEED buildings tend to be slightly more satised with the air quality and workspace cleanliness and less satised
with the amount of light, visual privacy and amount of space than occupants of non- LEED buildings .S. Altomonte , S. Schiavon, 2013, "Occupant

          <text>Financial Performance o f LEED &amp; En ergy Star 
Buildings
We find that buildings with a 'green rating'  command rental rates that are roughly 3 percent higher per square foot 
than otherwise i dentical buildings  controlling fo r the quality and the specific locatio n of office buildings. Ceteris 
paribu s, premiums in effective rents ar e even higher  above 6 p ercent . Selling prices of g reen buildings are higher by 
about 16 p ercent . 
Our analysis establishes that variations in the premium for gree n office b uildings are s ystematically related to their 
energy -saving characteristics. Fo r example, calculations show that a one dollar saving in energy costs from i ncreased 
thermal efficiency yields roughly 18 d ollars i n the i ncreased valuatio n of a n Energy -Star certified building.

long-t erm comfort evaluations with 
an accuracy of 73% to 87%,  
depending on the time of day.
For Gund Hall it was found that the 
students tolerated:  disturbing  
glare for 4% of time; direct sunlight 
(vertical eye illuminance
 &gt; 
1000lux) for 5% and reduced 
contrast (CR&lt;4) for up to  24%
Main idea: It does not have to be

to be satisfied with a space.

DGP isa recently proposed discomfort glare index that wasderived by
Wienol
d and Christoffersen from laboratory studies indaylit spaces using 72
test subjects inDenmark and Germany.
Two identical, side-by-side test rooms were used. In Room 1 a CCD camera
based luminance mapping technology wasinstalled at the exact same position and
orientation as the head of the human subject inRoom 2.

          <text>Types of Glare
Generally weare distinguishing between three types of glare:
Disability Glare :Glare that precludes aperson from seeing an object . An example
might be the inability ofalifeguard tosee all swimmers inapool.
Discomfort Glare: Anoccupant can stillseeallobjects of interest within ascene but
the overall brightness or luminance contrast within ascene cause strain of the eye
which over times -might lead todiscomfort, premature tiring of the eyeand other
effects .
Veiling Reflections :The latter isreally a subset of the former twoand corresponds
totimes when reflectances of specular surfaces act as glare sources .

          <text>Views
A view is a universally recognized asset in  architecture and real estate.
Benefits of a window  include occupants ability to focus  on a faraway  point to a 
direct link to the  outside world.
It seems surprising  that there  are no well established  metrics to evaluate a view.
 A view requires :
direct lines of
 sight between an inside observer and select outside objects

since 
views  work two ways , a view may become a privacy concern

We discussed three complementary approaches to predict the daylight
availability 
in buildings:
1.Daylight Autonomy Simulation-Based
2.Based on Occupant Assessments
3.Based on Rules of Thumb
Occupant assessments largely support simulation results.
Derived rules of thumb set can be used for massing studies.

Paper: C F Reinhart and D Weissman, "The Daylit Area -Correlating architectural student assessments with 
current and emerging daylight availability metrics," Building and Environment, 50, pp. 155- 162, 2012.A key architectural concept is to divide the floor plan of a building or space 
into a daylit and a non -daylit area. Within the daylit area indoor 
illuminance levels due to natural light should be adequate, useful and 
balanced for most of the year. In this exercise you are asked to follow your own 
intuition and divide [name of study space]into a daylit and a non daylit area. 
Please visit the [name of study space or spaces on date and time range] and 
individually conduct your assessment without consulting with the other 
students.

Rules of thumb indicate the daylight potential  of  a massing. Things can still
go wrong, but if the rules suggest limited potential, the  likelihood is high that any
daylighting
 strategies applied later in  the design process will have limited effect .
Rules  of thumb can be  used as formgivers. Then simulations can be  used to
refine design concepts.  Rules may also  be used  for quality control.

          <text>Architectural Considerations
Introduce setbacks on higher floors to inc rease the
sky access for lower levels .
If possible, reduce floor plan depth to less than 5-7
times the floor to ceiling height to maximize the
daylit area.
Open up the building through atria, windows ,
sk
ylights , and clerestories.
Place window as high as possible near the ceiling.
Create a vi
ewto/from the outside.
Use the daily
 and seasonal v ariations of daylight to
enhance visual interest.
High surface reflectances make rooms appear
larger
; a vertical/horizontal window near a bright
wall/ceiling makes a room appear wider/higher. dynamic interaction of light and building form

The reference office represents  a south-f acing sidelit  office located in Boston. The office
is not obstructed by neighboring buildings.
The large room depth of 8.2 m,  which corresponds to nearly  3.5 times the floor to
ceiling height, was conscious ly chosen  to be rather large  so that the effect of different
daylighting strategies remains visible  for all variants .

In a sidelit space with a standard window and venetian 
blinds, the depth of the daylit area usually lies between 
1.5 and 2 times the window -head-height.
If a space does not require the use of a shading device 
the ratio range can increase up to 2.5. Reinhart, Building Simulation 2005Paper :Reinhart CF,Asimulation -based review oftheubiquitous window -head -height todaylit zone

The primary focus of this course is the study of the thermal, luminous, and 
aco

The course examines the basic scientific pr inciples underlying these 
phenomena and introduces students to a range  of technologies and analysis 
techniques fo r designing comfortable indoo r environments. 
Students will be challenged to apply these techniques and explore the role light, 
energy, and sound can play in shaping architecture.

          <text>General Considerations 
 Internal gains and lighting loads are nearly always met with electricity in which case thermal load s and
energy use are identical.
 Mechanical heating and cooling systems have a maximum capaci ty, i.e. a maximum  output at any
particular point in time.
 If heating or cooling loads are temporarily higher than the system capacity the building under- heats
(should not happen) or overheats (may happen once in a while).
 If a system is always running significantly under its maximum capacity it always runs at part load and
accordingly ha
s been oversized which might result in unnecessarily high initial investment costs and
non-optimized system part loads.

          <text>General Considerations
 So far we have concentrated on quantifying and optimizing energy loads  in buildings for heating,
lighting, cooling, and internal gains using basic building design and passive systems concepts.
 Now we are looking at the mechanical hea ting &amp; cooling systems that are required to meet these
loads.

Up until the mid-1 990s chlorofluorocarbon  (CFC) gases were used 
which are strong greenhouse
 gases.
In the mid-1 990s CFCs were banned and replaced with 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)
.
In 2010s HCFCs are being replaced  with hydrofluorocarbons (HFC)

          <text>General Considerations 
 Is your building envelope or internal load dominated? You need cooling  in  the latter case.
 The closer you work with your HVAC engineer and the better you  are able to predict the temporal load curve of 
your building
, the more informed will be your choice when designing your HVAC system.
 Variables to consider include:
o thermal
 behavior of your building (thermal mass, solar gains, occupancy patterns)
o peak loads
o part load curves for your equipment
o size of system
 units
o return air/water temperature

          <text>Integrated Project Delivery
Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is a project delivery approach that integrates people, systems, business 
structures and practices into a process that collaboratively harnesses the talents and insights of all 
participants to optimize project results , increase value to the owner, reduce waste, and maximize efficiency 
through all phases of design, fabrication, and construction. IPD principles can be applied to a variety of 
contractual arrangements and IPD teams can include members well beyond the basic triad of owner, 
architect, and contractor. In all cases, integrated projects are uniquely distinguished by highly effective collaboration among the owner, the prime designer, and the prime constructor, commencing at early design
and continuing through to project handover.
--American Institute of Architects, 2007
Note: IPD in building design is linked to the concept of a Building Information Model (BIM).

          <text>Mean Radiative Temperature Calculation
Tomeasure themean radiant temperature at aparticular reference point, x, you
can use aspot thermometer tomeasure the surface temperature of all surfaces
seen from x.Youalso need toestimate theForm Factor (FF) of each surface
with respect tox. A form factor isthe fraction of the solid angle that agiven
surfaces takes within the point of view ofapoint tothe full solid angle (2)
surrounding the point .The sum of all form factors is1.
MRT4=Form_Factor1xMRT14+Form_Factor2xMRT24
withMRTi=temperature of surface iinKelvin ;FFi=form factor of surface i
For the space below all surfaces except for the screen had a temperature of 
26oC. The screen had a temperature of 43oC. Assuming that the screen takes up 
an estimated 7% of the surrounding surfaces from the position of a person seated at the desk, the MTR (in Kelvin) becomes:
MRT4= 0.93 x (273 + 26 ) K4+ 0.07 x (273 + 43) K4=&gt; MRT = 300.3 K = 27.3 o C

          <text>Metabolic Rates
Metabolic rates are given in W per area of skin. A typical adult  
has
 an effective skin surface area of  1.8 m2. =&gt; 1 person 
radiates about 100 W (an incandescent light bulb).
The metabolic rate, or human body heat production, is often 
measured in the unit "Met". The metabolic rate of a relaxed 
seated person is 1 Met, where 1 Met = 58 W/m2.

Baldwin 1898: It is usual to maintai n a room temperature of 70o F.
Le Corbusier: Maintain 18o C in buildings  all over t he world.
While temperature was early recognized to have a str ong (the only)  
impact of thermal comfort, relative humidity  was not a recognized 
concept. Instead, researchers used other descriptors  such as stuffiness,  
smell, draught.
This was
 partly due to our inability at the time to measure  CO2 or 
relative humidity.

          <text>Vacuum Insulation Panel (VIP)
http://www.enob.info/en/new -technologies/projects/details/precast -concrete -units -with -vacuum -insulation/VIP: ~35 R per inch
VIP are typically installed where space is very limited, for example in a basement or for a retrofit in a
room with
 limited floor-to-ceiling height.
With precast 
concrete units plus VIP, building assemblies can achieve a U-v alue of 0.15  W/mK, which
complies with 
the passive house standard, with a total thickness of only 27 cm as opposed to the more
standard 60 cm
.

          <text>From Architectural to Thermal Model
In a multi -zone thermal model we are treating each room as a well -mixed ther mal entity.
All windows are modeled coincident with the walls that they belong to.
External shading objects (entrance roof) are modeled separately.
The basement is being ignored and it is assumed that there is no heat flow between basement and the 1stfloor.
Fridays tutorial will discuss building a simple thermal model in Archsim .Architectural model Multi zone thermal model N

          <text>Internal Heat Gain from Occupants
Our Classroom
Together, we each generate around 100 W  of sensible heat. Maximum occupant density  is 45 divided over 12 m x 12 m. 
The resultant maximum occupancy heat  gain is
100 W
/person x 45 person/144 m2 =  31 W/m2 = 0.31 person/m2
Example Cottage
Assume a 4-person household distributed over 125m2andso
400W/125m2= 3.2 W/m2or0.0326 person/m2

          <text>Most building energy simulation programs come with a graphical user interface (GUI) as well 
as the actual simulation engine. The former is used to prepare simulation input files for the latter and to display simulation results once a simulation is complete. 
While the choice of GUI determines the ease of use of a simulation program, it is ultimately 
the engine that determines how reliable simulation results are. 
A great GUI with a weak engine cannot yield reliable results!Simulation Engine vs. GUI

          <text>Heating Degree Days (HDD)
The number of heating degrees in a day is defined as the  difference 
between a reference value of 65F (18C)  and the average outside  
temperature for that da
y.
Rule of thumb: If a site has
&gt;5000 oF 
HDD (~2800 oC  HDD): long cold winters
&lt;2000 oF HDD (~1100 oC  HDD): mild winters
A fixed base temperature of 18 C allows us to compare  different  
climates. However, 18C is not representative for all buildings. For 
the New England Home the lower balance point level is 8C.

EnergyPlus is freely available for download. The program comes with ample documentations 
but without a GUI. EnergyPluss capabilities are constantly being further expanded so that 
more recent modules might not be accessible through any GUI. As a result advanced users often start editing their models manually using a text editor. Once any manual changes have 
been made to a model one usually cannot go back to the GUI. 
Expert users can get access to the source code allowing for third -party validation which adds 
to the softwares credibility and long term reliability.

 The models were evalua t ed based on their adherence to solar criteria and geometrical diversity.
 Group B models showed a lower proportion of solar design deficiencies while demonstrating more geometrical creativit y , suggesting
that the use of more precise solar design tools actually helps to broaden the range of architectural form .Paper:  T Otis, Is Solar Design a Straitjacket for Architecture? Conference Proceedings of the 27th International conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture (PLEA),

          <text>Internal Heat Gain from Occupants
Same as individuals thermal comfort sensation varies, building occupants generate  varying amounts of heat 
and moisture. Key  factors that determine how much  sensible and latent energy  a person releases  are activity,  
age, and gender.
Sensible
 heat gains from occupants raise the indoor temperature. Latent heat gains need  to be considered  if 
the indoor air is actively dehumidified .
Occupancy load schedules are  determined through two factors: maximum occupancy heat gains and time of 
day schedules. 
Maxi
mum occupancy heat gains = activity- related heat gain/person x occupancy density

          <text>Exercise: Conduction Heat Loss through the Walls of the DOE Small 
Office Building
What isthe heat flow through the insulated wall, assuming anoutside temperature of-5oCand an inside
temperature of22oC?
Q = UA x ( Tinside  Toutside )
The U value of the wall is Uwall = 0.66 W/m2 K; the area is  A = 225.7 m2 and so
Q = Uwall x A x  (22o C   (5o C)) = 0.66 W/m2 K x 225.7 m2 x 27 K = 4 kW
If this temperature difference remains over the  course of an hour, the heat loss through the  walls is 4 kWh. Note: 
For thermal simulations we usually consider temperature changes in one hour increments (using TMY files).

Q: Imagine that during a cold night the heating system in the DOE Small Office Building breaks. It is 22o C in the building 
and -5o C outside. How fast does the indoor temperature fall with and without the thermal mass floor if one ignores the 
thermal mass of the walls?  
11.5kW
Concrete floor: 29.1kWh/K
No concrete floor: 0.5kWh/K
A: With concrete floor, the indoor temperature falls at 11.5 kW/29.1 kWh/K = 0.4 K/h. Without the thermal mass of the 
floor, the temperature is free- falling at 11.5 kW/0.5 kWh/K = 23 K/h.

Thermal mass may act as aliability tokeep as pace comfortable e.g. when itisonly used
intermittently .
Thermal mass hasreally noeffect ifth edirection of heat flow through thebuilding envelope stays
constant forextended periods oftime.

Now consider allheat losses including theroof (URoof= 0.19W/m2K)andwindows (UWindow = 3.24W/m2K).
What istheheat flow through the envelope assuming anoutside temperature of-5oCand an inside
temperature of22oC?
Q = UA x ( Tinside  Toutside )
And so:
Uwallx A x ( 22o C  (5o C)) =  0.66 W/m2K x 225.7 m2x 27 K = 4 kW
URoofx A x ( 22oC  (5oC))= 0.19W/m2K x511.1 m2x27K = 2.6 kW
UWindow x A x ( 22oC  (5oC))= 3.24W/m2K x55.8 m2x27K = 4.9 kW
UA=11.5kW
Note thatthewindows dominate even though their area issmall .

          <text>Heat Flow
Heat flow can take place inthree forms :
Conduction: Heat flow within a body or through bodies  in contact by the spread of molecular motion.
Convection: Heat
 flow from a solid to a  fluid (gas or  liquid) or vice versa. Convection involves the transport  of 
heat from one surface  to another via a moving fluid.
Radiation: Transfer of electromagnetic energy from one body to another.

Broad consensus regarding interest intotraini ng designers intheuse of simulations .
DesignersI have not seen a case in which 
this type of analysis has helped us to design a better building.
I appreciate insight gained 
from daylight simulations provided during design reviews by our sustainability consultants.
I highly value insight gained from daylight simulations and believe that some of the simulations should be conducted by designers, if adequate training is provided.
I highly value insight gained from daylight simulations and already use them during design.

Generally both model types ar every similar .
Touse an architectural model for daylighting analysis, different material types
have tobe organized by
layers .
Youhave totake care that mat erial properties are assigned correctly andthat
all relevant objects inyour scene, such as trees, neighboring buildings, and wall
thicknesses are included. Also pay attention tolight leaks .

How much fresh air does aforced air system need tosupply?
27 occupants need 20 x10l =270l/s= 0.27m3/s.
A 0.1 m2duct typically delivers around 0.13m3/s.This means that the building
needs around 0.2 m2of supply ducts .
Acentral, roof -mounted AirHandl ingUnit (AHU) requires roughly equally sized
supply and return ducts, i.e. 2 x 0.2 m2=0.4 m2.

          <text>Wind vs. Stack Effect
 Wind tends tobe an orde rofmagnitude larger than buoyancy .
 Stack does not rely onwin dand therefore can take place onstill, hotsummer days
when it is most needed. Stack isarelatively stable airflow (compared towind) and
offers greater flexibility inchoosing areas ofairintake .Itrelies ontemperature
differences (inside/outside).
 Stack may incur extra co sts(ventilator stacks, taller spaces) .
 Both effects arediff icult topredict inurban settings due tomicroclimatic effects .

          <text>What causes air flow?
Air flow is caused by a pressure difference. Air will flow from a zone of 
high pressure to a zone of low pressure.

          <text>Occupant Behavior What do we know?
Occupants open and close  their  windows consciously  and consistently .
The goal of opening
 the windows is to
create a connec tion to the outside (pleasant  sounds,  smells) and to
improve  indoor environmental
 conditions  (flush out VOCs,  induce some
air movement, replace inside air  with fresh outside air).

Infiltration and ventilation have tobe controlled toprovide thermal
comfort and indoor air quality tobuilding occupants .
Indoor air quality is sues relating tocontaminants intheair(such as
volatile organic compounds) willbe addressed inalater lecture.
Commercial buildings intheUSt endtobe ventilated using forced air .
These buildings tend tobe sealed (have no operable windows) and use
economizer cycles tocool the air ifdesired .There always hastobea
percentage of outside air of at least 10% .

T1T2 T2
T2&lt;T1Now think of the cylinder as a building. There will be one height at 
which there is no pressure difference between the outside and 
the inside. This is called the neutral pressure level .
During the winter the inside temperature is higher  t han the ambient temperature and the 
base of
 the building is depressurized whereas the top is pressurized. During the summer 
t
he relationship is reversed.  As a consequence basements  draw in cool  air in the winter. 
During the summer moist air  from the mai n living areas is pushed int o the basement, 
which tends to be cooler t han the rest of the house, whic h may i n turn l ead to 
condensation. The consequenc e is that dehumidifiers  ar e often needed i n basements in 
air-conditioned buildings.

          <text>Summer Design Week (July 7thto 13th)
Of course, the reason  why we do not simply discard  our active cooling  systems is that indoor  
temperatures  rise. The figure compares  temperatures  in the New England  Home with and without 
active cooling.  In the no-cooling  scenario  the windows  are permanently  closed  (no natural  ventilation).  
At what
 point are the interior  temperatures  too high to be comfortable?

As a rule of thumb, we want the outside air at least 3 K below the maximum  
comfortable indoor temperature.  During the typical summer week this  is mostly the case,  
i.e. there is potential for natural ventilation during that week.ASHRAE 55 comfort range

          <text>Terminology
According totheASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 27:
Airexchange of outdoor air with the air already inabuilding can bedivided into
twobroad classifications :ventilation and infiltration.
Ventilation airisair used toprovide acceptable indoor air quality .Itmay be
composed of forced or natural ventilation, infiltration, suitably treated re-circulated
air, transfer air, or an appropriate combination. Itincludes the intentional
introduction of air from the outside into abuilding and isfurther subdivided into
natural ventilation and forced ventilation.
Natural ventilation istheflowof air through open windows, doors, grilles, and other
planned building envelope penetrations .
Forced ventilation isthe intentional movement of air into and out of abuilding
using fans and intake and exhaust vents .
Infiltration istheflow of outdoor air into abuilding through cracks and other
unintentional openings .Infiltration isalso known as airleakage into abuilding.

          <text>Air Flow 
Air flow or air movement is usually expressed through a volume flow 
rate, q. Typical units used are cubic feet per minute (cfm) and liters per 
second (L/s). Sometimes, the ventilation rate is also expressed on a 
per person or per unit floor area basis, such as cfm/p or cfm/ft .
Avq = area * velocity
Note: When designing a ventilation system, the ventilation rates are required to 
determine the sizes of fans, openings, and air ducts.
