          <text>Types of gas-filled detectors
 Three types of gas-filled detectors in common 
use:
 Ionization chambers
 Proportional counters
 Geiger-Mueller (GM) counters
 Type determined primarily by the voltage applied 
between the two electrodes
 Ionization chambers have wider range of 
physical shape (parallel plates, concentric 
cylinders, etc.)
 Proportional counters and GM counters must 
have thin wire anode</text>

          <text>Ionization chambers
 If gas is air and walls of chamber are of a 
material whose effective atomic number is 
similar to air, the amount of current produced is 
proportional to the exposure rate
 Air-filled ion chambers are used in portable 
survey meters, for performing QA testing of 
diagnostic and therapeutic x-ray machines, and 
are the detectors in most x-ray machine 
phototimers
 Low intrinsic efficiencies because of low 
densities of gases and low atomic numbers of 
most gases</text>

individual interactions is lost
 If the amount of electrical charge collected from 
each interaction is proportional to the energy 
deposited by that interaction, then the net 
current is proportional to the dose rate in the 
detector material

          <text>Dynodes
 Electrons emitted by the photocathode are 
attracted to the first dynode and are accelerated 
to kinetic energies equal to the potential 
difference between the photocathode and the 
first dynode
 When these electrons strike the first dynode, 
about 5 electrons are ejected from the dynode 
for each electron hitting it
 These electrons are attracted to the second 
dynode, and so on, finally reaching the anode</text>

          <text>Spectroscopy
 Most spectrometers operate in pulse mode
 Amplitude of each pulse is proportional to the 
energy deposited in the detector by the 
interaction causing that pulse
The energy deposited by an interaction is not 
always the total energy of the incident particle or 
photon
A  pulse height spectrum is usually depicted as a 
graph of the number of interactions depositing a particular amount of energy in the spectrometer 
as a function of energy</text>

requires little amplification
 Often used for inexpensive survey meters
 In general, GM survey meters are inefficient 
detectors of x-rays and gamma rays

 Detectors may also be classified by the type of

 Detectors, such as Geiger-Mueller (GM) detectors, 
that indicate the number of interactions occurring in 
the detector are called counters
 Detectors that yield information about the energy 
distribution of the incident radiation, such as NaI scintillation detectors, are called spectrometers
 Detectors that indicate the net amount of energy 
deposited in the detector by multiple interactions are 
called dosimeters</text>

          <text>Interaction rate
 Main problem with detectors in pulse mode is 
that two interactions must be separated by a 
finite amount of time if they are to produce 
distinct signals
 This interval is called the dead time of the system
 If a second interaction occurs in this interval, its 
signal will be lost; if it occurs close enough to the 
first interaction, it may distort the signal from the 
first interaction

the electrodes
 Ionizing radiation produces ion pairs in the gas
 Positive ions (cations) attracted to negative 
electrode (cathode); electrons or anions attracted to positive electrode (anode)
 In most detectors, cathode is the wall of the 
container that holds the gas and anode is a wire inside the container</text>

          <text>Technitium-99m
 Technetium-99m is used in 20 million diagnostic nuclear 
medical procedures every year.
 It is a gamma ray emitting isotope used as a radioactive 
tracer that medical equipment can detect in the body. It 
is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140 keV gamma rays (about the same 
wavelength emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic 
equipment), and its 
half-life for gamma emission is 6.01 
hours. The short half life of the isotope allows for 
scanning procedures which collect data rapidly, but keep 
total patient radiation exposure low.
 Molybdenum-99 is produced mainly by fission of HEU
 Decays to Tc-99m (half-life of 66hrs)
 Tc-99m is chemically extracted from Mo-99 fairly easily</text>

 1 MeV neutron has a speed of
 1.383 x 107m/s
 Will cross a 15 cm sample in 11 nanoseconds
 0.025 eV neutron has a speed of
 2187 m/s
 Will cross a 15 cm sample in 70 microseconds
 Conclusion: When studying neutron 
distributions, the energy levels involved and the 
size of the systems usually make it possible to 
neglect the beta decay of the free neutron.</text>

          <text>Inelastic Scattering (n,n)
 Plays a key role in neutron slowing down a 
high energies
 Requires a threshold energy to excite the 
nucleus to a quantum state
 The neutron can thus lose a considerable 
amount of energy in one collision since most 
of it is used to bring the nucleus to this 
quantum state</text>

          <text>Energy Dependence of x.s.
 General Rule: x.s. decreases with increasing 
energy of incoming neutron
 At low energies (&lt;1 MeV), (n,n) is nearly 
constant whereas (n, ) is proportional to 1/v
 In the keV range, resonances are superimposed 
on the 1/v trend, these resonances are formed 
when neutron energy + binding energy 
correspond to an excitation level of the nucleus.</text>

          <text>Radiative Capture (n,)
 Neutron combines with target of mass A to 
produce nucleus of mass A+1 in a quantum 
state.  The excitation of this state is equal to the sum of the neutron binding energy and the 
kinetic of the neutron.
 Energy is released in one or more gamma rays
 This reaction is very important in the 
production of radioactive medical isotopes.()*11 1

 One of the most difficult neutron interactions to 
measure and the most complicated to analyze 
theoretically.
 It is also one of the most important reactions in 
reactors, characterization devices, 
 Elastic Scattering requires to consider the 
double differential cross section which describes the angular distribution and the energy 
distribution as well as the total elastic cross-section.</text>

          <text>Cross-sections are strongly dependent of 
neutron incoming energy. This relation is 
important in the understanding of x.s. but also to 
estimate the time a neutron spends in a 
particular region.
 Classical expression for K.E. is sufficiently accurate 
because rest mass of a neutron is fairly large (939.55 
MeV)

10B is used as a thermal absorber
 Very small x.s. in heavy nucleis, because 
emitted charge particle must overcome Coulomb 
barrier in order to escape nucleus

 The energy absorbed from any type of

defined as the absorbed dose
 Historical unit is the rad = 100 ergs/gram (1 
erg = 10-7J)
 SI unit is the Gray (Gy) = 1J/gram (1 Gy = 100

          <text>Thermal neutrons can be 
easily shielded by Boron 
or Cadmium as they have 
large neutron cross 
sections in the thermal region
 Cd has the disadvantage of 
emitting high energy 
gammas after neutron 
capture which requires 
additional gamma shielding
 High speed neutrons are 
more difficult to shield 
against, because 
absorption x.s. are smaller in that range.
 Thus it is first necessary to 
moderate the neutrons105

          <text>Since neutron and gammas are relatively 
penetrating radiations, the dose equivalent 
is easier to estimate from fluence
 Dose equivalent (H) = Dose (D) x Quality (Q)
 Quality factor is a function of the type of radiation
 If D is in rad, H is in rem
 If D is in Gy, H is in Sievert (Sv)

          <text>Significance
 If the mean free path of neutrons emitted by a sample in 
a passive assay instrument is long compared to the 
dimensions of the sample, it is likely that most neutrons will escape the sample and enter the detection region.
 If we know the number of collisions to thermalize, we can 
estimate the needed moderator thickness (must also consider the scattering angle)
 If the thickness of a shield is many times the mean free 
path of a neutron trying to penetrate the shield, then the 
shield fulfills its purpose (complicated by the energy 
dependance of the x.s.)</text>

          <text>Goal of R -matrix
Phase shift theory requires knowledge of the 
potential V(r)
Approximated by square well
R-matrix theory builds a relationship between a 
matrix R that depends only on observable, 
measurable quantities and the collision matrix
Bypasses the need for the potential
Requires experimental data
We will derive a simplistic case of a neutron 
interaction with no spin dependence</text>

          <text>Covariance Matrix
 The covariance matrix or dispersion matrix 
is a matrix of covariances between 
elements of a random vector. It is the 
natural generalization to higher 
dimensions of the concept of the variance 
of a scalar-valued random variable.

          <text>The Unresolved Resonance Range (URR)
Energy range over which resonances are so narrow and close together that they cannot 
be experimentally resolved.
A combination of experimental measurements of the average cross section and 
theoretical models yields distribution functions for the spacings and widths.
The distributions may be used to compute the dilute-average cross sections:

          <text>The Probability Table Method
- Concept developed in the early 1970s by Levitt (USA) and Nikolaev, et al. (USSR).
- Uses the distributions of resonance widths and spacings to infer distributions of  cross section values.
- Basic idea:
	 - Compute the probability p
n that a cross section in the URR lies in band n
	   defined as
	 - Compute the average value of the cross sections (s n) for each band n.
	 - Following every collision (or source event) in a Monte Carlo calculation for	   which the final energy of the neutron is in the URR, sample a band-averaged	   cross section with the computed probabilities and use that value for that neutron	   until its next collision.s
