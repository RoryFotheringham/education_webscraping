          <text>Chord notation: scale degrees 
Chords are also distinguished and notated by the scale degree  of their root note or bass note. 
For example, since the rst scale degree of the C major scale is the note C, a triad built on
top of the note C would be called the one chord, which might be notated 1, I, or even C, in
which case the assumption would be made that the key signature  of the particular piece of
music in question would indicate to the musician what function a C major triad was fullling,and that any special role of the chord outside of its normal diatonic function would be inferredfrom the context. 
Roman numerals  indicate the root of the chord as a scale degree  within a particular key as 
follows: I&#13;tonic 
ii&#13;supertonic
iii&#13;mediant 
IV &#13;sudominant 
V&#13;dominant 
vi&#13;submediant 
vii &#13;subtonic/leading tone 
Many analysts use lower-case Roman numerals to indicate minor triads and upper-case formajor ones, with degree and plus signs (
o and +) to indicate diminished and augmented
triads, respectively .

          <text>Melody is said to result where there are interacting 
patterns of changing events occurring in 
time." [1]Change is necessary for events "to be 
understood as related or unrelated." Melodies often 
consist of one or more musical phrases , motifs, and 
are usually repeated throughout a song or piece in 
various forms. 
	Melodies may also be described by their melodic 
motion or the pitches or the intervals between 
pitches..., pitch range, tension and release, continuity 
and coherence, cadence , and shape. "Many extant 
explanations [of melody] conne us [sic] to specic 
stylistic models, and they are too exclusive." [1] Melody ( Wikipedia)

          <text>What makes a melody a recognizable pattern?
What is the representational essence of melody such that it
can be recognized 
1) if notes are transposed (all shifted by the same frequency
ratio)?
2) if notes are played faster or slower (tempo invariant)
is it contour? : up/down changes in pitch
does it depend on musical intervals?: 
&#13;as relative distances in pitch space
absolute pitches?: note
scale position?: re tonic

          <text>Deep structure of melodies 
Even if the surface structure is 
altered quite a bit (as is commonin jazz or any variations on a
theme), the melody is
recognizable. Part of this may bethe result of chord progressions,and aspect of the deep intervallic
harmonic and melodic structure. 
Schenker pioneered a method of
reducing a melody to itsessentials, stripping off
successive layers of ornament.

          <text>Three chord song 
"A three-chord song is a song whose music is built around three chords that are 
played in a certain sequence . Perhaps the most prevalent type of three-chord 
song is the simple twelve bar blues  used in blues  and rock and roll . 
Typically , the three chords used are the chords on the tonic, subdominant, and 
dominant (scale degrees I, IV and V): in the key of C, these would be the C, F 
and G chords. Sometimes the V7 chord is used instead of V , for greater tension . 
Three-chord songs are easy for the listener to remember , which can make them 
effective in pop music . Some of the most famous songs to use three-chord 
patterns are "Louie Louie " by The Kingsmen and "Wild Thing" by The Troggs . 
Three-chord songs like these are also easier to learn than other , more 
complicated songs. Among others, country singer Hank Williams and folk singer 
Bob Dylan have written large numbers of such songs. Denis Leary 's song 
"Asshole" uses a three chord progression. Punk music very often features three-
chord songs -sometimes called a 'three chord trash' (cf. The Ramones)."

          <text>Melody ( Wikipedia) 
In music , a melody (from Greek  -melida, 
"singing, chanting" [1]), also tune , voice , or line, is a 
linear succession of musical tones which is perceived as 
a single entity . In its most literal sense a melody is a 
sequence of pitches and durations, while more 
guratively the term has occasionally been extended to 
include successions of other musical elements such as 
tone color .

          <text>"In music, modulation is most commonly the act or process of 
changing from one key (tonic, or tonal center ) to another. This 
may or may not be accompanied by a change in key signature. 
Modulations articulate or create the structure or form of many 
pieces, as well as add interest. 
There are several different types of modulation -- (these) modulations may be 
prepared or unprepared, smooth or abrupt. It is smoother to modulate to more closely related keys than to keys further away. Closeness is determined by the 
number of notes in common between keys, which provides more possible pivot 
chords, and their closeness on the circle of fths. A modulation is often 
completed by a cadence in the new key, which helps to establish it. Brief 
modulations are often considered tonicizations ."

          <text>Common progressions 
"The most common chord progressions, in the common practice 
period and in popular music, are based on the rst, fourth, and 
fth scale degrees  (tonic, subdominant and dominant ); see three 
chord song , eight bar blues , and twelve bar blues . 
The chord based on the second scale degree is used in the 
most common chord progression in Jazz, II-V-I. 
The circle of fths progression is generally regarded as the most 
common progression of the common practice period
(1600-1900), involving a series of descending perfect fths that 
often occur as ascending perfect fourths. The circle of fths 
makes up many of the most commonly used progressions, such 
as II6, V , I in major ."

35 Fig. 1. Pure-tone (262 Hz, 50 ms duration) stimulus patterns are shown with inter-onset intervals of 390 ms (above) and schematized metrical accent 
representations (below). The periodic contr ol condition consisted of isochronous tones designed to elicit a simple pulse perception (A). The binary contr ol 
condition consisted of alternating loud and soft tones, designed to elicit a duple meter perception (B). The omit-loud condition consisted of the binary control 
pattern with missing loud tones on 30% of two-tone cycles (C). The omit-soft condition consisted of the binary control pattern with missing soft tones on 30% 
of two-tone cycles (D). Source: Snyder, J. S., and E. W. Large. "Gamma-band Activity Reflects the Metric

          <text>Major points -- rhythm 
Rhythm involves perception of temporal patterns of events 
Recurring patterns group into chunks that create expectations of 
future temporal occurences of events (rhythmic pattern 
induction) 
Rhythmic grouping occurs on the same timescale as 
melodic grouping. 
We also infer a metrical grid that involves a regular set of 
timepoints (pulse, tatum) and a regular pattern of accented/ 
unaccented events (meter). (Metrical induction) 
Expectations generated from rhythmic grouping and metrical 
induction processes can be manipulated for tension-relaxation 
effect.

          <text>Time 
"timedoes not exist without changes." Aristotle, Physics, IV 
Time as an absolute world-coordinate (Newtonian time)  vs. time as epistemic 
change (psychological, Bergsonian time) 
"A man in sound sleep, or strongly occupy'd with one thought, is insensible of time Whenever we 
have no successive peceptions, we have no notion of time, even tho' there be a real succession 
in the objectstime cannot make its appearance to the mind, either alone, or attended with a 
steady unchangeable object, but is always discovered by some perceivable succession of 
changeable objects." Hume as quoted in Fraisse, pp. 3-4 
Measurement of time 
How is time measured, psychologically , by the neural mechanisms and informational 
organizations that constitute our minds?

          <text>Meter (e.g. 4 pulses per measure, accent) 
Denition: The number of pulses between the more or 
less regularly recurring accents 
/.notdef.g0001(Cooper and Meyer , 1960). 
Most authors dene meter similarly , as somehow 
dependent upon (and perhaps contributing to) 
patterns of accent. 
Zuckerkandl (1956), however , views meter as a series 
of "waves" that carry the listener continuously from 
one beat to the next. For him, they result not from 
accentual patterns but simply and naturally from the 
constant demarcation of equal time intervals.

Our sense of the length of time (Fraisse, 1962, The Psychology of T ime) 
152 BPM Constant W eber fractions for interval estimation 
Errors are proportional to the interval estimated 
Weber's law for timing; jnd's on the order of 8-12% 
depending on modality (hearing, touch, vision) 
Temporal prediction of reward in conditioning 
(Scalar timing intimately related to the response latency in conditioning when interval 
between stimulus and reward are varied, see R. Church, A Concise Introduction to Scalar 
Timing Theory , 2003. See also Fraisse's (1963) discussion of Pavlov and Popov 
cyclochronism model) 
Some general observations (Fraisse via Snyder , Music &amp; Memory): 
Filled time durations appear shorter than empty ones 
Rate of novel events makes durations appear shorter 
(monotonous durations are experienced as longer , but remembered as shorter) 
Aging: young children overestimate durations; older adults underestimate durations 
(A systematic change in internal timing mechanisms with age? cf absolute pitch) 
Implications for music: pieces with high event densities go faster; those 
with low ones seem to take forever; duration is in the mind of the 
beholder and his/her expectations

we seem to infer an underlying metrical

This perception of an underlying metrical

musicians playing in groups. 
Meter serves as a temporal context that is

present, on events that have occurred in the last 
few seconds to minutes.

          <text>SUMMARY 
Evoked GBA appears to represent sensory processing 
as predicted by the presence of tones, much lik e the 
MLR. Induced GBA ma y reect tempor ally precise ex 
pectancies for strongly and weakly accented ev ents in 
sound patterns. Moreov er, induced GBA beha ves in a 
manner consistent with perception- action coordination 
studies using perturbed tempor al sequences. T aken 
together , the char acteristics of induced GBA provide 
evidence for an activ e, dynamic system capable of 
making predictions (i.e. , anticipation), encoding metri 
cal patterns and reco vering from unexpected stimuli. 
GBA appears to be a useful neuroelectric correlate 
of rhythmic expectation and ma y therefore reect pulse 
perception. Due to the anticipatory nature of GBA, it 
may be supposed there is an attentional dependence. 
Future research should aim to manipulate attentional 
state, localize neur al sources and further probe the 
role of induced GBA in meter perception.

	metrical dissonance Denition: According to 
Krebs (1987), a situation in which the pulses in two 
metrical levels are not well aligned, either because 
the duration of the pulses in one level is not an 
integral multiple or division of the duration of the 
pulses in the other level, or because the pulses in 
one level are displaced by some constant interval 
from those in the other level. See also Yeston's 
rhythmic dissonance .

H( j,i +j) = max (X( 1,i ), X( 1,i )*H( j,i )*(1+j/100)) where X is the i n 
envelope of the Ligeti  fragment, and H is the value of the signal in delay loop j (firs 
index) at time t (second index). The buildup factor (1+j/100) depends on the duration 
of the delay loop (i.e. equal to j samples). The mean signal value H in the delay 
channels over the last 200 samples (thicker line) and over the whole fragment (thin 
line) are shown in the top right line plot. The waveforms that are built up in the three 
most activated delay loops are shown above. The results, not surprisingly resemble 
those obtained with the running autocorrelation.  The sampling rate of th e 
signal was approximately 10 Hz.

          <text>Course rationale(s) 
	Music is an important aspect of the auditory sense that rivals 
speech and language in complexity 
	Many of us come to auditory research through a native interest in music 
	Music af fords an alternative perspective on hearing and 
neuroscience, spanning acoustics , sensory physiology , 
auditory perception &amp; auditory cognition 
	We strive to be systematic and integrative in our treatment 
(lecture format, common grounding) 
	A primary goal is to facilitate intellectual synthesis; to organize 
disparate facts into coherent wholes 
	We want students to choose &amp; formulate their own problems, 
articulate their own perspectives, and delve deeply into an 
area of personal interest (fundamental problems, term projects)

          <text>Coursework 
Cour sework : 
 Problem sets (20%) 
One problem set will be on harmonic structu re and tuning systems. The other will cover topics in music 
perception and cognition . 
 Musical  exampl es (10% ) 
Find 5 musical examples f rom any genre that illust rate or illuminate different aspects of music perception &amp; 
cognition related to  melody,  harmony , rhythm, your own musical preference, and some aspect of your 
choosing. We will l isten to them as a class and discuss them. 
 Reading  assignm ent &amp; presentation (10%) 
A relevant paper wil l be chosen, presented (10-15), and discussed by the class. This can be one  of the papers 
on the reading list or any paper that you feel is important or insightful. 
 Fundam ental unsol ved questions in music psychol ogy  3-4 page outline/discussion (20% ) 
I have compiled a list of unsolved questions in music psychology. Please choose from the list or suggest your 
own probl em. Write up an account of the nature of the p roblem (1-2  paragraphs) , its theoretical 
significance (1 paragraph) , current theories (if any,  1-3 parag raphs), two plausible hypothetical 
explanations (2-4 paragraphs) , ideas concerning how the question might be solved or hypotheses tested 
(1 paragraph) , and some assessment of how soon the problem will likely be solved (1 paragraph) . Each 
student will present a p roblem and outline their thinking a bout it, which will form the basis for a class 
discussion. 
 Term project (50% of final grade) 
A research paper, review paper, or research pro ject (e.g. psychological or physiological experiment, 
computer model/simulation) related to the psyc hology of music. Topics will be presented orally and 
discuss ed in class in mid-March. Project results will be presented and discussed in class in the last two
weeks of class. Target length of paper will depen d on nature of project. Final papers will be due on the
last day of c lass. I will be happy to read an d give comment on outlines and drafts at any stage of 
preparation.

&#13;Psychoacoustics, psychology (listener s response, incl. our own)
&#13;Neurocomputational models (information processing theories)
&#13;Possible neurobiological substrates (neurophysiology)
We will also go back and forth between bottom-up approaches to 
&#13; particular aspects and &#13;their relevance to music as a whole.

          <text>Big questions (Whys and Hows) 
	To be explained: the "unreasonable 
effectiveness" of music" 
(to paraphrase Wigner on the unreasonable ef fectiveness of mathematics in explaining the physical world) 
	Why does music have its profound ef fects on 
us? 
	How does the auditory system and the brain
work such that music can have the ef fects that 
it does? 
	(to paraphrase W arren McCulloch, "What is a number that a man may know it, and a man that he may 
know a number?")

          <text>Ubiquity of music: Nature and nurture 
	Music has been part of human culture for &gt; 40,000 years 
	Every known extant culture has some form of music 
	Many cultures equate musical with social harmony (Greeks)
	Relative contributions of nature (biology) &amp; nurture (culture)
to the experience of music. 
	A great deal of diversity exists across cultures in the forms 
music takes (ethnomusicology) 
	There are universals related to how we hear that are given bybiology (auditory science). 
	But there are also the ef fects of culture-based training of how
we hear (what aspects we attend to). 
	There are also culturally-specic interpretations and
meanings associated with what is heard.
 In these lectures we will focus mainly on the universals --
basic aspects of music that are shared across cultures.
	We want a general framework for talking about music that can 
encompass both the W estern tonal music (classical, jazz, popular) as well

          <text>The elusive attributes of timbre
J.F. Schouten (1968, p.42)  describes the "elusive attributes of 
timbre" as "determined by at least ve major acoustic 
parameters" which Robert Erickson (1975) nds "scaled to 
the concerns of much contemporary music":
1. The range between tonal and noiselike character .
2. The spectral envelope
3. The time envelope in terms of rise, duration, and decay .
4. The changes both of spectral envelope (formant-glide) and 
fundamental frequency (micro-intonation).
5. The prex, an onset of a sound quite dissimilar to the 
ensuing lasting vibration.

          <text>Vocal Ring, or The Singer's Formant 
One seemingly mysterious property of the singing voice is its 
ability to be heard even over a very loud orchestra. At first 
glance, this is counter-intuitive, since the orchestra is 
perceived by us to be so much louder than a single singer . 
The answer to this mystery lies in the way the sound energy 
of the operatic voice is distributed across various frequencies.

          <text>Wikipedia on timbre
In music, timbre (pronounced /tm-br'/, /tm.br/  like tamber, or /
tm(br)/,[1] from Fr . timbre tb) is the quality of a musical note  or 
sound or tone that distinguishes dif ferent types of sound production, 
such as voices or musical instruments . The physical characteristics of 
sound that mediate the perception of timbre include spectrum and
envelope. Timbre is also known in psychoacoustics  as tone quality  or 
tone color . 
For example, timbre is what, with a little practice, people use todistinguish the 
saxophone  from the trumpet  in a jazz group, even if both
instruments are playing notes at the same pitch  and loudness . Timbre 
has been called a "wastebasket" attribute [2] or category ,[3] or "the 
psychoacoustician's multidimensional wastebasket category for
everything that cannot be qualied as pitch or loudness." [4]

          <text>Music timbre space and phonetic space
Human speech communications systems are mostly built on timbral
distinctions, although there are tonal languages in which pitch contourconveys distinctions....... 
This could be because of the dif ferent voice pitches of human 
speakers, or it could be due to the relative ease of rapidly changingvocal resonances rather than changing voice pitch (harder to sing than

Vowels = sustained notes = spectral dif ferences (formants) 
Consonants = onset patterns = amplitude &amp; frequency uxes 
I believe that we will eventually come to a unied theory of both
musical timbral distinctions and phonetic distinctions that is groundedin how the auditory system encodes spectrum and rapid changes.......

          <text>Operational denition of pitch 
	Pitch is that auditory quality that varies with the periodicity and/or
frequency of sounds. 
	(i.e. not loudness, duration, location, or timbre) 
	Operationally , pitch is dened as the frequency of a pure tone to 
which a sound is matched. 
	Since pure tone pitch changes very slightly (0-4%) with large changesin sound pressure level (40 dB), the level of the reference tone also
has to be specied. 
	For musical sounds (complex tones), this much celebrated
dependence of pitch on level is quite minimal (&lt; 1% over 40 dB). The
more harmonics, the smaller the effect.

          <text>Fundamentals and harmonics
	Periodic sounds (30-20kHz)
produce pitch sensations.
	Periodic sounds consist of 
repeating time patterns. 
	The fundamental period (F0) is theduration of the repeated pattern. 
	The fundamental frequency is therepetition frequency of the pattern. 
	In the Fourier domain, the
frequency components of a 
periodic sound are all members of
a harmonic series (n = 1*F0, 2*F0,3*F0...). 
	The fundamental frequency is
therefore the greatest common
divisor of all of the component
frequencies.
	The fundamental is also therefore 
a subharmonic of all componentfrequencies.

          <text>Sirens
A simple siren is produced by forcing compressed air 
through equally spaced holes on a rotating disk. This 
produces a periodic vibration whose frequency equals De la Tour's sirenthe rate of holes passing by the air nozzle.

          <text>From masking patterns
to "auditory lters" as amodel of hearing 
Power spectrum
Filter metaphor
Notion of one central 
spectrum that subserves 
2.2. Excitation pattern Using the lter shapes and bandwidths derived from masking experiments we can
produce the excitation pattern produced by a sound. The excitation pattern shows how much ener gy comes 
through each lter in a bank of auditory lters. It is analogous to the pattern of vibration on the basilar
membrane. For a 1000 Hz pure tone the excitation pattern for a normal and for a SNHL  (sensori-neural 
hearing loss) listener look like this: The excitation pattern to a complex tone is simply the sum of the 
patterns to the sine waves that make up the complex tone (since the model is a linear one). We can hear out 
a tone at a particular frequency in a mixture if there is a clear peak in the excitation pattern at that
frequency . Since people suf fering from SNHL  have broader auditory lters their excitation patterns do not 
have such clear peaks. Sounds mask each other more, and so they have difculty hearing sounds (such as
speech) in noise. --Chris Darwin, U. Sussex, http://www .biols.susx.ac.uk/home/Chris_Darwin/Perception/Lecture_Notes/Hearing3/

          <text>Steps to prevent hearing damage 
Use earplugs (reduce levels by 20-30 dB) 
Photo courtesy of KarenD on Flickr. 
Take measures in recurring situations where you experience 
ringing in your ears (concerts, discos) 
Impulsive loud sounds are worst (gunshots, hammering) 
Be wary of cranking up the level in cars, especially when the
windows are down (if it sounds terribly loud when you re 
stopped at a light, this should tell you something) 
With personal sound players (MP3s, iPods, walkman),
always set the listening level in quiet
don t crank up the level in noisy situations
use the volume limiter feature (set this in quiet)
if you listen in noisy situations (mowing the lawn), then by all
means use noise-cancellation headphones

          <text>A few words about Loudness 
	Loudness is the perceptual attribute that covaries with the intensity
of sounds (loudness is the subjective attribute, intensity is the
physical, acoustical property) 
	We mentioned that the auditory system has a huge dynamic range, 
over a factor of 100,000 between the sound pressure level of thesoftest and the loudest sounds. 
	Loudness is important in music for several reasons 
	Listening level  (louder music is more salient, captures attention) 
	Onsets and accents (loudness contrast accents notes) 
	Dynamics  (changes in loudness communicate tension, relaxation) 
	Safety issues  (listening to music at high levels (&gt;100 dB SPL) for
prolonged periods of time will damage your ears and impair your
ability to hear music

          <text>The enigma of the central representation of pitch 
The tight correspondences between psychophysics and the 
population interspike interval code strongly suggest that our 
perception of pitch depends on this information. 
Yet, despite some recent advances, we still do not understand 
how the central auditory system uses this information. 
What happens to neural timing information as one ascends the 
auditory pathway from auditory nerve to cortex? 
Is time converted to some sort of place code (e.g. pitch 
detectors) or is some other kind of code involved?

	Tonal music is based in large part on pitch 
relations 
	Sequences of pitches constitute melodies 
	Relations between combinations of pitches
constitute harmonies 
 Sets of pitches make up musical scales, which 
are the perceptual atoms of musical tonality
	Musical pitch is relative pitch (transpositional
invariance) 
	We will discuss absolute pitch later in the course

          <text>Harmonic series 
A harmonic series conists of integer multiples of a fundamental frequency , 
e.g. if the fundamental is 100 Hz, then the harmonic series is: 100, 200,
300, 400, 500, 600 Hz, .... etc. 
The 100 Hz fundamental is the rst harmonic, 200 Hz is the second
harmonic. The fundamental is often denoted by F0.
The fundamental frequency is therefore the greatest common divisor of all
the frequencies of the partials. 
Harmonics above the fundamental constitute the overtone series . 
Subharmonics are integer divisions of the fundamental:
&#13;e.g. for F0= 100 Hz, subharmonics are at 50, 33, 25, 20, 16.6 Hz etc.
&#13;Subharmonics are also called undertones.
The fundamental period is 1/F0, e.g. for F0=100 Hz, it is 1/100 sec or 10

What are Modes of a Scale? 
"A modal melody is one that is not in a "key" of the major or mi
sort common in music of the Western world in the past 300 to 4
years. Instead, its scale may be comprised of almost any set tones, not only those that imply 3-part harmony. In fact, generallshould not imply 3-part harmony and a bass line. Many of the momelodies I like best are virtually impervious to triadic harmonizati
There are two common types of modal scales: pentatonic aheptatonic, meaning 5-tone and 7-tone, respectively. Folk mufrom many parts of the world, including Celtic, American, African, aChinese, often use modes of pentatonic scales."

Twelve tone equal temperament took hold for a variety of 
reasons. 
It conveniently t the existing keyboard design, and was a 
better approximation to just intonation than the nearby 
alternative equal temperaments. 
It permitted total harmonic freedom at the expense of just a 
little purity in every interval. This allowed greater expression through 
enharmonic 
modulation , [a means of shifting between keys using chords 
that are shared by two keys] .... Equal temperament became 
the standard gradually during the Romantic era.

          <text>Modes (Reference slide)
According to the nomenclature of medieval music theorists, who were dealing largely with unchorded plainsong, our natural major is 
the church "Ionian Mode" (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C), and our natural minor is the church "Aeolian mode" (C-D-D#-F-G-G#-A#-C). I became 
curious about modes when I learned that "Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" and "Scarborough Fair" use the old balladic scale 
which matches the church "Dorian Mode" (C-D-D#-F-G-A-A#-C). I used the eerie church "Mixolydian mode" (C-D-E-F-G-A-A#-C) for 
my intranet version of "The Pathology Blues", on our quizbank. You can also hear the church "Mixolydian mode" in "The Beat Goes 
On", "Luck Be a Lady Tonight", "Norwegian Wood", "Day Tripper", "Sundown" (Gordon Lightfoot), "Cats in the Cradle", "City of New 
Orleans" (verse but not chorus), and the theme to "Star Wars". Caedmon recordings used it for the tune for the mystical first song 
in Yeats's play "The Only Jealousy of Emer". The other church modes are novelties at best. Some of the old Gregorian chant "Sing 
my tongue..." seems to be Phrygian mode. There is some of the church "Phrygian mode" in "Fiddler on the Roof", and if the song is 
fully transposed into the church Phygian mode, it still sounds okay. My own attempt  to write a song using the church Phrygian mode 
was dismal. I wrote a little song in an unabashed  church "Lydian mode". The mode itself suggested the subject. Unless you only use 
the subdominant as a leading tone for the dominant, any melody you write in this "mode" will be unnerving --the subdominant is 
equidistant from the lower and upper tonics. A correspondent pointed out that the "Lydian" mode makes up some of the "Jetsons" 
and "Simpsons" theme. Bartok wrote a short piece in the Lydian mode .In the Locrian mode, the dead-center position of the dominant 
makes this even more unmusical. A music professional told me once that no ethnomusicologist has ever documented a folk tune in 
what medieval theorists called the "Locrian mode". I browsed  a little in Plato, Aristotle, pseudo-Plutarch's "De Musica", and of course 
the Oxford History of Music, and came away wondering if the medieval music theorists (Boethius, Gregory the Great, their 
successors) really meant the same thing as did the Greeks who named the modes. Today most people (following a scholar named 
Westphal) tell us that the Greek modes were indeed used as "scales" with the tonic notes being the low-pitched one, just as the 
church mode theorists say. This seems to be based on statements in Plato and Aristotle that the modes had distinct emotive 
qualities, as our major and minor scales do. Another school of thought (that of Munro) claims that for the ancients, the modes were 
actually keys, i.e., you could play any melody in any mode. If this is true, then the ancient Greeks had either perfect pitch or a 
standard pitchpipe. I think people have probably liked similar tunes in different eras. I tried to figure out how the ancient Greeks 
would have played some of our favorites. Ancient Greek lyres typically had seven strings. (Some Hebrew lyres must have had ten 
strings --see Psalm 33.) The system of modes is also called "harmoniae", which meant "fitting" or "tuning". Greek writers on music 
talk about the normal tuning comprising two tetrachords, i.e., a series of four notes with the lowest and highest separated by a major 
fourth and sharing the center string. Pythagoras and Terpander are both credited with the idea of having the highest string be an 
octave of the lowest string.

	Although dif ferences between just and

discriminable when notes are presented
sequentially (as for measuring JNDs), 
	these dif ferences can become apparent 
when notes are sounded together . 
	The dif ferences are somewhat subtle, 
but are most obvious when the notes 
are sustained harmonic complexes, e.g.
organ-like.

"The Answer is Dark" is an example of one of those 
more exotic modes. It's in a mode of a scale that uses 
3 half-step interv als, causing one interv al to be an

Listen to a MIDI file of the scale mode: 
It would be in G# Mixolydian except that the A# has been lowered 
to A. This is sometimes called a "mixed mode" because it has 
characteristics of two diatonic modes.

          <text>Diatonic scale 
"In Music theory , the diatonic major scale is a fundamental building block of the 
Western musical tradition. The diatonic scale is composed of two tetrachords 
separ ated by interv als of a whole tone. The pattern of interv als in semitones is as 
follows 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. The major scale begins on the first note and proceeds by 
steps to the first octave. In solfege, the syllables for each scale degree are "Do-R e-
Mi-Fa-Sol-La- Ti-Do". The natur al minor scale can be thought of in two ways, the first 
is as the relativ e minor of the major scale, beginning on the sixth degree of the scale 
and proceeding step by step through the same tetrachords to the first octave of the 
sixth degree. In solfege "La-Ti-Do-R e-Mi-F a-Sol." Alternately , the natur al minor can 
be seen as a composite of two different tetrachords of the pattern 2-1-2-2-1-2-2. In 
solfege "Do-R e-Mi-F a-Sol-La- Ti-Do ." All of non-folk Western harmon y from the some 
point in the late Renaissance up to the late nineteenth century is based upon these 
two objects and the unique relationships created by this system of organizing 7 
notes. It should be kept in mind that most pieces of music change key, and thus 
scale, but are still related to the beginning diatonic scale. The white keys on a piano 
correspond to the diatonic scale of C major (C-D-E-F-G- A-B-C), with the notes a 
whole tone apart, except for E-F and B-C, which is an interv al of a semitone (half a 
tone). Diatonic comes from the greek "diatonik os" or "to stretch out". It is 
sometimes used to refer to all the modes, but is gener ally used only in reference to 
the major and minor scales."

	     Harmonic Canons: there are two types. The simpler 
type is Harmonic Canon II; these box-like instruments 
have 44 strings and adjustable bridges which are
uniquely configured for each piece. Harmonic Canon I
has two planes of 44 strings each. The planes intersect 
near the middle of each string and thus the player may
play on either plane or both at once. Also a moveable 
pyrex rod controls the pitch on some strings in one
plane. The harmonic canons are both melody 
instruments and as providers of the harmonic

          <text>Problems that tuning creates and solves.... (Wikipedia, Musical temperament) 
"Just intonation has the problem that it cannot modulate to a different key (a very 
common means of expression throughout the Common practice period of music) 
without discarding many of the tones used in the previous key, thus for every key 
the musician wishes to modulate to, the instrument must provide a few more 
strings , frets, or holes for him or her to use. When building an instrument, this can 
be very impractical. 
Well temperament is the name given to a variety of different systems of 
temperament that were employed to solve this problem, in which some keys are 
more in tune than others, but all can be used. This phenomenon gives rise to 
innite shades of key-colors, which are lost in the modern standard version: 12 
tone equal temperament (12-TET). Unlike Meantone temperament , which alters 
the fth to temper out the Syntonic comma, 12-TET tempers out the Pythagorean 
comma, thus creating a cycle of fths that repeats itself exactly after 12 steps. 
This allowed the intervals  of Tertian harmony , thirds and fths, to be fairly close to 
their just counterparts (the fths almost imperceptibly beating, the thirds a little 
milder than the Syntonic beating of Pythagorean tuning), while permitting the 
freedom to modulate to any key and by various means (e.g. common-tone and 
enharmonic modulation, see modulation ). This freedom of modulation also 
allowed substantial use of more distant harmonic relationships, such as the 
Neapolitan chord, which became very important to Romantic composers in the 
19th century ."

          <text>Important points 
 Scales are anchored pitch systems 
 The anchor is the tonic, rst note in the scale 
 The pitch intervals of the notes re: the tonic
 give the scale its characteristic tonality
 Scales include both consonant and dissonant 
intervals that provide tonal contrast.
 Equal temperament tuning systems use logarithmic
frequency spacings to achieve systematicity
(equality of keys good for key modulations). 
 The 12-TET  system represents just frequency ratios
(2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 5:3) fairly well -- importantbecause of consonance, fusion, pitch stability .

          <text>Complex modes of vibration
 
Most physical systems have multiple
modes of vibrations that create 
resonances that favor particular
sets of frequencies. 
Vibrating strings or vibrating columns 
of air in enclosures exhibit 
harmonic resonance patterns. 
Material structures that are struck 
(bells, xylophones, percussive
instruments) have resonances
that depend partly on their
shape and therefore
canproduce frequencies that
are not harmonically related. 
More later on what this means for 
pitch and sound quality .

          <text>Sound level basics 
	 Sound pressure levels are measured relative to an absolute
reference 
	 (re: 20 micro-Pascals, denoted Sound Pressure Level or SPL).
 
	 Since the instantaneous sound pressure uctuates, the
average amplitude of the pressure waveform is measuredusing root-mean-square RMS. (Moore, pp. 9-12) 
	 Rms(x) = sqrt(mean(sum(xt2))) 
	 Where xt is the amplitude of the waveform at each instant t in the
sample 
	 Because the dynamic range of audible sound is so great, magnitudes
are expressed in a logarithmic scale, decibels (dB). 
	 A decibel of amplitude expresses the ratio of two amplitudes 
(rms pressures, P1 and P_reference) and is given by the
equation: 
&#13;&#13;dB = 20 * log10(P1/P_reference) 
&#13;&#13;20 dB = 10 fold change in rms level

0 dB SPL  is set at 20 microPascals 
60 dB SPL  is therefore a 1000 fold change in RMS over 0 dB 
A typical background sound level is 50-60 dB SPL. 
Dynamic range describes the range of sound pressure levels. 
The auditory system registers sounds from 20 dB to &gt;&gt; 120 dB SPL 
The auditory system has a dynamic range in excess of 100 dB (!) or a
factor of 105 = 100,000 in amplitude. 
It is quite remarkable that musical sounds remain recognizable over
most of this range. This a fundamental aspect of hearing that all 
auditory theories must address -- how auditory percepts remain
largely invariant over this huge range (perceptual constancy).

THRESHOLD is the just noticeable difference (jnd) of a single frequency, the critical 
bandwidth represents the ear's resolving power for simultaneous tones or partials. 
In a COMPLEX TONE , the critical bandwidth corresponds to the smallest frequency 
difference between two PARTIAL s such that each can still be heard separately
 . It may also be measured by taking a SINE TONE  barely MASK ed by a band of WHITE NOISE 
around it; when the noise band is narrowed until the point where the sine tone 
becomes audible, its width at that point is the critical bandwidth. See: RESIDUE
. In terms of length (see diagram under  BASILAR MEMBRANE) the critical bandwidth is nearly 
constant at 1.2 mm, within which are located about 1300 receptor cells , and is 
generally independent of intensity (unlike  COMBINATION TONE S). Twenty-four critical 
bands of about one-third octave each comprise the audible spectrum.

          <text>From masking patterns
to "auditory lters" as amodel of hearing 
Power spectrum
 Filter metaphor
 
Notion of one central 
spectrum that subserves 
2.2. Excitation pattern. Using the lter shapes and bandwidths derived from masking experiments we can
produce the excitation pattern produced by a sound. The excitation pattern shows how much ener gy comes 
through each lter in a bank of auditory lters. It is analogous to the pattern of vibration on the basilar
membrane. For a 1000 Hz pure tone the excitation pattern for a normal and for a SNHL  (sensori-neural 
hearing loss) listener look like this: The excitation pattern to a complex tone is simply the sum of the 
patterns to the sine waves that make up the complex tone (since the model is a linear one). We can hear out 
a tone at a particular frequency in a mixture if there is a clear peak in the excitation pattern at that
frequency . Since people suf fering from SNHL  have broader auditory lters their excitation patterns do not 
have such clear peaks. Sounds mask each other more, and so they have difculty hearing sounds (such as
speech) in noise. --Chris Darwin, U. Sussex

          <text>Critical bands (usually interpreted in terms of frequency analysis) 
Simultaneous tones lying within a critical bandwidth do not give any increase in
 
perceive d loudness  over that of the single tone, provided the sound pressure level
 
remains constant. For tones lying more than a critical bandwidth apart, their
 combination results in increased loudness.
 
When two tones are close together in frequency, BEATS occur, and the resulting 
tone is a fusion of the two frequencies. As the frequency difference increases, roughness in the tones appears, indicating that both frequencies are activating the
same part of the basilar membrane . Further apart, the two frequencies can be
discriminated separately, as shown below by DfD, whereas roughness only 
disappears at a frequency separation equal to the critical bandwidth DfCB. At this point, the two frequencies activate different sections of the basilar membrane. This phenomenon only applies to monaural listening with pure tones. With DICHOTIC listening, the basilar membrane of each ear is activated separately, and therefore no roughness results. With complex tones, frequency discrimination is improved but thecritical bandwidth remains the same for each of the component partials. 
Alternative interpretation is that critical bandwidths are the result of fusion of
(e.g. interspike interval) representations rather than cochlear proximity per se.

          <text>Harmonic series 
A harmonic series consists of integer multiples of a fundamental frequency , 
e.g. if the fundamental is 100 Hz, then the harmonic series is: 100, 200,
300, 400, 500, 600 Hz, .... etc. 
The 100 Hz fundamental is the rst harmonic, 200 Hz is the second
 
harmonic. The fundamental is often denoted by F0.
 
The fundamental frequency is therefore the greatest common divisor of all
the frequencies of the partials. 
Harmonics above the fundamental constitute the overtone series . 
Subharmonics are integer divisions of the fundamental:
 
&#13;e.g. for F0= 100 Hz, subharmonics are at 50, 33, 25, 20, 16.6 Hz etc.
 &#13;Subharmonics are also called undertones .
 
The fundamental period is 1/F0, e.g. for F0=100 Hz, it is 1/100 sec or 10

          <text>Fundamentals and harmonics 
 
	 Periodic sounds (30-20kHz)
 
produce pitch sensations.
 
	 Periodic sounds consist of 
 repeating time patterns. 
 
	 The fundamental period (F0) is the
 duration of the repeated pattern. 
 
	 The fundamental frequency is the
 repetition frequency of the pattern.
 
	 In the Fourier domain, the
 
frequency components of a 
 
periodic sound are all members of
 
a harmonic series (n = 1*F0, 2*F0,
 3*F0...).
 
	 The fundamental frequency is
 
therefore the greatest common
 
divisor of all of the component
 
frequencies.
 
	 The fundamental is also therefore 
 
a subharmonic of all component
 frequencies.

The upper limit of human hearing  is ~ 20,000 cycles/sec  (Hertz, Hz).
 
There is a theorem in signal processing mathematics that the highest frequency that can
 
be represented is 1/2 the sampling rate (called the Nyquist frequency).
 
This is why sound for CDs is sampled at 44.1 kHz.
 
In theory , this is the point where all sound distinctiona we can hear is captured.

Don t conate these with cochlear lters or auditory
nerve excitation patterns! Auditory lters are derived
from psychophysical data &amp; reect the response of the
whole auditory system. For lower frequencies and higher
levels AFs have much narrower bandwidths than 
cochlear resonances or auditory nerve ber responses.

          <text>Frequency spectra 
The Greeks understood simple relationships between vibration rate &amp; pitch. 
Experiments with musical instruments and tuning systems were carried out by &#13;many people (Galileo s father , Galileo, Saveur , Mersenne, others). 
Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) showed that any waveform can be 
&#13;represented as the sum of many sinusoids ( Fourier spectrum ). 
George Ohm (1789-1854) postulated that sounds can be decomposed into component sinusoids Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) postulated that the ear analyzes sound &#13; by rst breaking sounds into their partials and then doing associative pattern-recognition 
Debate between Seebeck, Ohm, &amp; Helmholtz (1844) over periodicity vs. spectral pattern 
&#13;Foreshadows temporal vs. place codes, autocorrelation vs. Fourier spectrum 
Each sinusoid of a particular frequency ( frequency component, partial ) has 2 parameters: 
 1) its magnitude  (amplitude of the sinusoid) 
 2) its phase (relative starting time) 
A sound with 1 frequency component is called a pure tone . 
A sound with more than one is called a complex tone .

          <text>Music vs. speech 
Music is somewhat distinct from acoustic communication in which component sounds
are symbolic vehicles through which encoded messages are conveyed
(e.g. speech, Morse code), because their functions are dif ferent 
Speech sounds not part of a coded message system can be musical 
Musical sequences can also be used as symbols in communication (bugle calls) 
Speech also has rhythmic aspects that are musical (lexical music, poetry) 
Of course, music and speech do come together in vocal music, where speech is made
musical without destroying its communicative aspects.

          <text>Vand de Geer et al (1962) conclusions (D. Huron) 
Van de Geer et al made the following 3 conclusions:
1. Musical intervals are judged using three basic dimensions: pitch 
height, pleasantness, and fusion.
2. Musicians and non-musicians use the term "consonant" 
differently . Musicians typically consider unisons, octaves, fths 
and fourths as the most consonant, whereas non-musicians 
typically experience thirds and sixths as being more consonant.
3. Non-musicians conceive of "consonance" primarily in terms of 
pleasantness. 
No straightforward relationship between consonance &amp; fusion. [for
Pure tone stimuli! -- pac]
The main lesson is that care must be taken when instructing 
listeners to judge intervals. Some terms are largely synonymous 
(such as euphonious and pleasant), whereas other terms are not 
interchangeable (such as pleasant and fused).

          <text>Some observations 
1.	The all-order interspike interval distribution at the 
level of the auditory nerve constitutes an 
autocorrelation-like representation of the stimulus. 
2.	Since each low harmonic generates intervals at its 
own period and its multiples, the representation 
includes all subharmonics of the partials. 
3.	The interval patterns are formed from the summation 
of subharmonics (cf. Terhardt's virtual pitch) 
4.	The sieve computes the pattern-strength of these 
subharmonics of the partials. 
5. This representation contains both overtone &amp; 
undertone series (i.e. more than pure spectral overlap).

In most tonal contexts, these intervals are perceived as more consonant.
However there can be contexts where some of these intervals can be dissonant.

          <text>Neural basis of consonance 
In the 1990s we (Mark Tramo, Peter Cariani, 
and Bertrand Delgutte did an extensive neuro -
physiological study of the neural basis of 
consonance in the cat auditory nerve. 
We found neural correlates both 
for roughness and pitch fusion. 
These neural correlates both match up with 
human listener judgments quite well.

          <text>Roughness isnt all there is to consonance..... 
Non-musician listeners judged each harmonic interval 
using a 7-point scale for each semantic term. Using 
factor analysis, van de Geer, Levelt and Plomp found 
that the responses grouped into three independent 
factors. The analysis produced three statistically 
significant factors. One factor (dubbed pitch) 
included the scales high, sharp, tense, narrow , and 
active. A second factor (dubbed pleasantness) 
included the scales euphonious, consonant, and 
beautiful. A third factor (dubbed fusion) included the 
scales rough, more tones and fusion. 
The first factor (pitch) was found to correlate 
directly with the mean frequency of the pitches used 
in the interval.

          <text>Neural coding of pitch fusion 
Covaries with roughness models; many parallels. Both
explain basic consonance of complex harmonic tones quitewell 
Responsible interval information probably exists at least up
to the level of the midbrain (IC) -- work by Greenberg (FFR)
Interval models parallel spectral pattern approaches
 (e.g. Terhardts subharmonics, Parncutt) 
Pitch competition and stability leads to a theory of tonalstability and higher levels of tension-relaxation. 
Fusion is similar to Stumpfs theory
Based in part on undertone series; may be related toRiemanns theory of harmonic dualism

          <text>Roughness isn t all there is to consonance..... 
Part of the difculty of obtaining consonance judgements is the meaning
of consonance  for listeners. 
Van de Geer , Levelt &amp; Plomp (1962) used the same stimulus set of pure 
tone dyads but asked subjects to rate the stimuli according to 10 criteria. 
Van de Geer , Levelt &amp; Plomp (1962) carried out an important study where they 
asked Dutch listeners to judge tone pairs according to ten different scales: 
Englis h Dutch from Dav id Huron s website 
high-low (hoog-laag) 
sharp-round (scherp-rond) 
beautiful-ugly (mooi-lelijk) 
active-passive (actief-passief)

euphonious-diseuphonious (welluidend-onweeluidend)

          <text>Neural coding of roughness 
Discharge rate uctuations in neuronal ensembles in the 20-120 
Hz range encode beatings of nearby harmonics 
These uctuations exist in ensembles of auditory nerve bers 
(CF band) and across the whole AN population (population 
PST) 
They are seen at the level of the midbrain (IC) --work by 
McKinney , Delgutte, &amp; Tramo 
Roughness as infra-pitch --too slow for pitch mechanisms, too 
fast for resolving individual events (rhythm) 
Not clear to me whether it is the rate uctutations per se or 
existence of low periodicities below the pitch range (longer than 
the duration of the interval analysis window) that cause the 
roughness quality per se

          <text>Tonotopy , cochleotopy &amp; frequency maps: Common pitfalls
Orderly spatial arrangements of frequency-tuned neurons 
(auditory frequency maps) exist at every auditory station. 
However, these maps are coarse relative to perceptual 
discriminations, especially for low frequencies (&lt; 2 kHz) and for 
moderate to high sound levels (&gt; 60 dB SPL). 
I have yet to see evidence in the literature for neuronal tuning 
ner than about 1/2 octave for low frequency tones at high 
levels (barely good enough to resolve the 2nd harmonic). 
In auditory cortex the ordering of frequency tunings is only seen 
at very low sound levels --tonotopy breaks down at moderate 
to high levels (&gt; 60 dB SPL).

 Rough cochleotopy  is found at all levels, but not &#13;&#13; 
&#13; necessarily &#13;in all neural populations 
 Highly ordered tonotopic maps  exist only at low tone levels, &#13;near 
neural thresholds 
 As one ascends the afferent pathway: 
 Numbers of neurons at each level increases 
 Fine timing information exists in great superabundance in &#13;lower 
&#13;stations, but becomes successively sparser 
 Firing rates (spontaneous &amp; driven) decline 
 Inhibition increases; % nonmontonic rate-level fns incr . 
 Diversity and complexity of response increases 
 History-dependence and contextual effects increase 
 Some modulation tuning that suc. declines in periodicity 
Typical BMFs: AN: 200-300 Hz; IC: 50-100 Hz; Ctx (&lt; 16 Hz)

          <text>Basic problems to be solved 
 "Hyperacuity problem" 
 Account for the precision of pitch discriminations given the relatively coarse tunings of
auditory neurons (at all levels), especially lower-frequency ones (BFs &lt; 2 kHz) 
 "Dynamic range problem" 
 Account for the ability of listeners to discriminate small fractional changes (I/I) in intensity
over a large dynamic range, and especially at high SPLs, where the vast majority of ring
rates are saturated. 
 "Level-invariance problem" 
 Account for the invariance (and precision) of auditory percepts over large dynamic ranges
given the profound changes in neural response patterns that occur over those ranges (ratesaturation, rate non-montonicities). 
Pitch equivalence 
Account for the ability to precisely match pitches of pure and complex tones (pitch
equivalence, metamery) given differences in spectra and under conditions where stimulusintensities are roved 20 dB or more 
Relative nature of pitch &amp; transpositional invariance 
Account for the ability to precisely match pitches an octave apart (and/or to recognize
patterns of pitch sequences) in the absence of an ability to identify absolute frequencies/
periodicities. Account for ability to recognize transposed melodies as similar.

3. Strongest common subharmonic after F0 weighting, which
biases against low F0s, is the virtual pitch 
Parallels with all-order interspike interval models
Each harmonic generates intervals at its subharmonics
Adding together all the intervals and nding the most
common intervals therefore nds the common 
subharmonics (F0/n)
F0-weighting is achieved by limiting interval length

Spectral vs. virtual pitch: duplex model
Virtual pitch computation:
1. Identify frequency components, e.g. 1000, 1200, 140
2. Find common subharmonics 
&#13; 
3. Strongest common subharmonic after
&#13;F0 weighting is the virtual pitch

          <text>Basic problems to be solved 
 "Hyperacuity problem" 
 Account for the precision of pitch discriminations given the relatively coarse tunings of
auditory neurons (at all levels), especially lower-frequency ones (BFs &lt; 2 kHz) 
 "Dynamic range problem" 
 Account for the ability of listeners to discriminate small fractional changes (I/I) in intensity
over a large dynamic range, and especially at high SPLs, where the vast majority of ring
rates are saturated. 
 "Level-invariance problem" 
 Account for the invariance (and precision) of auditory percepts over large dynamic ranges
given the profound changes in neural response patterns that occur over those ranges (ratesaturation, rate non-montonicities). 
Pitch equivalence 
Account for the ability to precisely match pitches of pure and complex tones (pitch
equivalence, metamery) given differences in spectra and under conditions where stimulusintensities are roved 20 dB or more 
Relative nature of pitch &amp; transpositional invariance 
Account for the ability to precisely match pitches an octave apart (and/or to recognize
patterns of pitch sequences) in the absence of an ability to identify absolute frequencies/periodicities. Account for ability to recognize transposed melodies as similar .

          <text>Harmonic series 
A harmonic series conists of integer multiples of a fundamental frequency , 
e.g. if the fundamental is 100 Hz, then the harmonic series is: 100, 200,
300, 400, 500, 600 Hz, .... etc. 
The 100 Hz fundamental is the rst harmonic, 200 Hz is the second
harmonic. The fundamental is often denoted by F0.
The fundamental frequency is therefore the greatest common divisor of all
the frequencies of the partials. 
Harmonics above the fundamental constitute the overtone series . 
Subharmonics are integer divisions of the fundamental:
&#13;e.g. for F0= 100 Hz, subharmonics are at 50, 33, 25, 20, 16.6 Hz etc.
&#13;Subharmonics are also called undertones.
The fundamental period is 1/F0, e.g. for F0=100 Hz, it is 1/100 sec or 10

          <text>.General theories of pitch
1. Distortion theories 
 reintroduce F0 as a cochlear 
distortion component (Helmholtz)
sound delivery equipment can
reintroduce F0 through distortion
however , masking F0 region does not
mask the low pitch (Licklider) 
low pitch thresholds and growth of 
salience with level not consistent with 
distortion processes (Plomp, Small) 
binaurally-created pitches exist 
2. Spectral pattern theories
Operate in frequency domain
Recognize harmonic relations
on resolved components
3. Temporal pattern theories

          <text>Some generalities about the auditory system 
 Rough cochleotopy  is found at all levels, but not necessarily in all &#13;pops 
 Orderly tonotopic spatial maps  exist only at low tone levels, near neural &#13;thresholds 
As one ascends the afferent pathway: 
 Numbers of neurons at each level increases (usually 2x or more) 
 Fine timing information exists in great superabundance in &#13; lower &#13; 
&#13;stations, but becomes successively sparser 
 Firing rates (spontaneous &amp; driven) decline (usually 2x or more) 
 Inhibition increases; % nonmontonic rate-level functions increase 
 Greater proportion of phasic responders, onset &amp; offset responses 
 Diversity and complexity of response increases 
 History-dependence and contextual effects increase 
 Some modulation tuning that suc. declines in periodicity 
Typical BMFs: AN: 200-300 Hz; IC: 50-100 Hz; Ctx (&lt; 16 Hz) 
 No clear "pitch detectors" (Schwarz &amp; Tomlinson, 1991);  
until, perhaps, recently (Bendor &amp; W ang, 2005) 
 No narrow (BW &lt; 0.3 octaves)  "frequency channels" for BFs &lt; 2 kHz (thus far)
