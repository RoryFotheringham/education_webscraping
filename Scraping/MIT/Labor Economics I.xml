A Slutsky derivation 
Uncompensated and Compensated Labor Supply 
Utility is a function of consumption (x) and leisure (l), where h = T -l is hours 
worked. 
 Uncompensated ( Marshallian) demands are a function of wages, prices, 
and unearned income 
{x(p, w, y),l(p, w, y)} = arg max U(x, l) 
s.t. px = w(T -l)+ y 
This gen erates uncompensated labor supply: 
h(p, w, y)= T -l(p, w, y) 
 Compensated ( Hicksian) labor supply is a function of wages, prices and 
utility 
{x c(p, w, u),lc(p, w, u), } = arg min wl + px 
s.t. u = U (x, l) 
This is the dual problem, generating compensated labor supply: 
hc(p, w, u)= T -lc(p, w, u) 
The d erivative of the compensated labor supply function is the substitution 
eect. 
The excess expenditure function 
 A con sumer spends this much to get to u: 
E[p, w, u]= px c(p, w, u)+ wlc(p, w, u) 
px c(p, w, u)+ w(T -hc(p, w, u))

This i s Ashenfelter (1978) parameter scheme 2, where S is replaced by 
S0, an ex ante subsidy value based on pre-program earnings. Note that 
labor supply must fall.

Estimates 
Rural NIT: 5 experimental treatments (G,T) plus controls in each of IA and 
NC. About 800 families exposed for 3 years; Average G=3,200 (50-100% pov 
level) and t=1/2 (.3-.7). Ashenfelter pools data for the three years and regresses 
change in log earnings on year eects, tax rates, and guarantee or subsidies as 
proportion of unearned income.

Roughly 45% of drivers oered a virtual Taxi lease took it 
85% of those who bought a lease came out ahead 
Average earnings gain for those who chose taxi was $84 
Taxi was under-subscribed: many with farebox above breakeven chose 
to sit out 
We use gaps between the control group proportion above breakeven 
and treatment group opt-in rates to identify a behavioral lease rate 
that rationalizes Taxi take-up

          <text>Composition of Jobs Heterogeneity and Composition of Jobs 
Timing of Events 
The timing of events is as follows. 
First, each rm has to choose its capacity (physical capital ), k, 
irreversibly. This choice captures the type of job the rm has designed 
and the line of business it has chosen, and is assumed to be costless. 
At this point, the rm does not know the type of the worker it will 
recruit. 
Next, the rm matches with a worker, nds out his type, and decides 
whether to shut down or continue. If it continues, it installs the 
required equipment and incurs a cost ck. 
Finally, wages are determined.

The Burdett-Mortensen Model (continued) 
There is a continuum m &lt; 1 of rms. 
They post wages and their wage oers are seen by a worker at the 
ow rate q. Thus p and q are exactly as in our standard search model, 
except that they are not what matching probabilities but ow rates 
of a worker seeing a wage, and a wage being seen by a worker. 
For simplicity, let us take p and q as exogenous. 
Unemployed workers receive a benet of b &lt; 1. Employed workers 
produce output equal to 1, and there is no disutility of work. 
There is exogenous separation at the rate s, and also potentially 
endogenous separation if workers receive a better wage oer. 
Both workers and rms are risk-neutral and discount the future at the 
rate r.

As before, shocks arrive at some rate, here assumed to be exogenous 
and potentially dierent between the two types of jobs 
s1, s2 : separation rates 
Finally, we allow for population growth of both skilled unskilled 
workers to be able to discuss changes in the composition of the labor 
force. 
In particular, let the rate of population growth of L1 and L2 be n1 and 
n2 respectively. 
n1, n2 : population growth rates 
This structure immediately implies that there will be two separate 
Beveridge curves for unskilled and skilled workers, given by 
s1 + n1 s2 + n2u1 = u2 = . s1 + n1 + 1q(1) s2 + n2 + 2q(2)

An increase in the heterogeneity of jobs in terms of physical capital to

Can this model explain non-participation? 
Suppose that workers have outside opportunities distributed in the

market is not attractive enough. 
Suppose that there are N1 and N2 unskilled and skilled workers in the 
population. 
Each unskilled worker has an outside option drawn from a distribution 
G1 (v ), while the same distribution is G2(v ) for skilled workers. 
In summary:

Nominal Wage Rigidity 
Another possibility is downward nominal wage rigidity. 
This was popular in the early Keynesian models, but was then 
dismissed based on the argument that it would imply countercyclical 
real wages 
it would only do so if there are no other shocks than 
productivity/demand shocks changing labor demand and downward 
nominal wage rigidity is complete. 
One advantage of this is that its empirical extent can be assessed in a 
more careful manner.

Endogenous Job Destruction (continued) 
The job creation part of this economy is similar to before. 
In particular, since rms enter at the productivity , we have 
q () JF () = 0 
0(r + ) = = q()( d ) 
Recall that as in the basic search model, job creation is sluggish , in 
the sense that it is dictated by the matching function; it cannot jump 
it can only increase by investing more resources in matching. 
On the other hand, job destruction is a jump variable so it has the 
potential to adjust much more rapidly (but of course the relative 
importance of job creation and job destruction in practice is an 
empirical matter)

Dierentiation of (1) immediately gives

Greater productivity gives greater values the rm. 
When will job destruction take place? 
Since (3) establishes that JF is monotonic in , job destruction will be 
characterized by a cut-o rule, i.e., 
 d :  &lt; d  destroy
Clearly, this cuto threshold will be dened by 
rJF (d ) = 0

A simple variant of search models can also generate endogenous wage 
dispersion. Consider the following model due to Burdett and

There is a continuum 1 of workers, who can be employed or 
unemployed. 
Think of the workers as in the McCall sequential search world, 
observing wages from a given distribution (except that, imagine we 
are in continuous time, so workers see a wage at some ow rate). 
Moreover assume that both employed and unemployed workers receive 
wage oers at the ow rate p. 
An employed worker who receives an oer can leave his job and 
immediately start at the new job if he so wishes. The important 
assumption is that the future distribution of job oers and rate of job 
oers is unaected by whether the worker is employed or not (this is 
not an assumption in the original Burdett-Mortensen model, but it 
simplies life).

Therefore, this crucial elasticity depends on the interest rate, the 
separation rate, the bargaining power of workers, the elasticity of the 
matching function ( ()), and the job nding rate of workers 
(q()). 
Let us take one period to correspond to a month. Then the numbers 
Shimer estimates imply that q() ' 0.45, s ' 0.034 and r ' 0.004.
These numbers imply that the monthly interest rate is about 0.4%, 
an unemployed worker nds a job with a probability of about 0.45 
within a month and an employed worker transits into unemployment 
with probability 0.034. Moreover, like other papers in the literature, 
Shimer estimates a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas matching

To investigate this, consider the equilibrium condition

Rewrite this as 
r + s + q() 0 =(1  ) p (4)q() 
where p is net productivity , p = Af (k)  (r + )k  z, the net
prots that the rm makes over and above the outside option of the 
worker. This is not exactly the same as labor productivity, but as long 
as z is small, it is going to be very similar to labor productivity. 
The quantitative predictions of the model will therefore depend on 
whether the elasticity implied by (4) comes close to a number like 20 
or not.

It may also result from other bargaining protocols as emphasized by

(continued) 
Naturally, in matching the data we may not want to limit our focus to 
just productivity shocks, especially since the correlation between 
productivity shocks and vacancy-unemployment rate is not that high 
(roughly about 0.4). So there must be other shocks, but what could 
those be? 
One possibility is shocks to separation rates, for example because of 
plant closings. Hall (REStat 2005) also further argues that there is no 
way to resolve this puzzle by looking at the side of worker inows into 
unemployment. He suggests that most of the action is in job creation. 
To a rst approximation, job destruction or worker inows into 
unemployment can be ignored. There is debate on this point, those 
like Steve Davis working on job destruction rates disagreeing, but it s 
an interesting perspective.

Suppose that the wage distribution is not continuous, meaning that

oer a wage of w 0 +  than w 0 for  su ciently small, since with 
positive probability a worker will end up with two wages of w 0, thus 
accepting each with probability 1/2. A wage of w 0 +  wins the

Then the level of employment of a rm oering wage w (now and

where the explanation is intuitive; the oer of this rm is seen by a 
worker at the ow rate q, and if he is unemployed, which has 
probability u, he takes it, and otherwise he is employed at some wage 
distribution G. His wage is lower than the oered wage with 
probability G (w ), in which case he takes the job. 
The outow is explained similarly, bearing in mind that now what is 
relevant is not the actual wage distribution but the oered wage 
distribution F (w ).

When A increases, so do the net present discounted value of wages, 
and this leaves less prots, and therefore there is less of a response 
from vacancies. 
To see this point in greater detail, let us combine data and the basicc 
search model developed above. 
In particular, note that in the data the standard deviation of ln p (log 
productivity) is about 0.02, while the standard deviation of ln  is 
about 0.38. 
Therefore, to matched abroad facts with productivity-driven shocks, 
one needs an elasticity d ln /d ln p of approximately 20.

An increase in  (corresponding to skill-biased technological change 
or changing human capital of skilled workers or globalization) will 
increase inequality, but this eect will be muted inside region 1 
because search frictions create pooling. 
But an increase in  or in  (increasing the fraction of skilled 
workers) can switch the economy from region wanted region 2, i.e., to 
the separating equilibrium. This will create a discrete jump in 
inequality as well as in the equilibrium composition of jobs. 
It is particularly interesting that an increase in the supply of skilled 
workers can change the equilibrium in their favor (we see here a avor 
of induced skill biased technological change and directed technological 
change models).

below wage w is always lower than the fraction of oers below w, so 
that F rst-order stochastically dominates G. 
Stated dierently, this means that low wages have a lower probability

Thus equilibrium wages are positively selected from oered wages.

Discussion 
Why is there wage dispersion? The answer is similar to the models we 
have already seen. 
The Burdett-Mortensen model is sometimes interpreted as a model of 
monopsony . 
The reasoning is that rms do not face a at labor supply curve, but 
can increase their labor supply by increasing their wages (they 
attract more workers and avoid losing workers). 
The reason why wages are lower than full marginal product is argued 
to be this monopsony power. This is in fact quite misleading. In the 
baseline search model, there is both monopoly power and monopsony 
power (there is bilateral monopoly, that s why there is bargaining!). 
In fact, we saw that in the Diamond s Paradox, even though in 
equilibrium rms do not face an upward-sloping labor supply, they 
have full monopsony power, and can hold workers down to their

Endogenous Job Destruction (continued) 
The Beveridge curve is also dierent now. 
Flow into unemployment is also endogenous, so in steady-state we 
need to have 
F (d )(1  u) = q()u
In other words: 
F (d )u= ,F (d ) + q() 
which is very similar to our Beveridge curve above, except that 
F (d ) replaces s. 
The most important implication of this is that shocks (for example to 
productivity) now also shift the Beveridge curve shifts. 
E.g., an increase in p will cause an inward shift of the Beveridge
curve; so at a given level of creation, unemployment will be lower.
How does endogenous job destruction aects e ciency?

Understanding Fluctuations in the Search Model

As a rst benchmark, suppose that we have e ciency, so that the 
Hosios condition holds. In this case, we would have  =  ()= 0.72. 
In that case, we have 
d ln  0.034 + 0.004 + 0.72  0.45 ' d ln p (0.034 + 0.004 )  0.72 + 0.72  0.45 
' 1.03, 
which is substantially smaller than the 20-fold number that seems to 
be necessary. 
One way to increase this elasticities to reduce the bargaining power of 
workers below the Hosios level. But this does not help that much. 
The upper bound on the elasticity is reached when  = 0 is 
d ln  0.034 + 0.004 ' d ln p (0.034 + 0.004 )  0.72

Can the Model Generate Signicant Employment 
Fluctuations? 
The answer is no. 
Shimer (AER 2005) for example has shown that the model generates 
signicant movements in unemployment only when shocks are 
implausibly large. 
In other words, to generate movements in u and  similar to those in 
the data, we need much bigger changes in Af (k)  (r + )k, A or p 
(labor productivity or TFP) than is in the data.

Discussion (continued) 
Nevertheless, there are theoretical objections to the 
Burdett-Mortensen model. The most important is that it is not 
optimal for rms to post wages. Instead they should post contracts 
that make workers pay upfront and receive their full marginal 
products. If this is not possible (because negative wages or bonding 
contracts are not allowed), they can make workers receive a low-wage 
early on, and increase their wages later. Why is this? 
Finally, note that even though there is wage posting here, there isn t 
directed search. In the next lecture, we will see that directed search is 
the essence. The previous model of wage dispersion in fact may have 
mimicked directed search, for reasons we are going to see more clearly 
soon.

Good Jobs Versus Bad Jobs (continued) 
The technology of production for the inputs is Leontie. 
When matched with a rm with the necessary equipment (capital kb
or kg ), a worker produces 1 unit of the respective good. 
The equipment required to produce the rst input costs kg while the 
cost of equipment for the second input is kb &lt; kg . In equilibrium, 
capital-intensive jobs will pay higher wages (thus correspond to 
good jobs). 
Firms can choose either one of two types of vacancies: (i) a vacancy 
for a intermediate good 1 - a good job; (ii) a vacancy for an 
intermediate good 2 -a bad job. 
Search is undirected between the two types of jobs (in the single labor 
market).

Search models can also be useful for studying the endogenous

dierent qualities, and quality dierences arise endogenously from two 
types of jobs that dier in terms of their capital intensity. 
A model in which heterogeneous workers look for heterogeneous jobs

types.

Quantitative Eects of Real Wage Rigidity 
How large can the impact of wage rigidity be? 
If all other assumptions of search and matching model are 
maintained, then this is bounded by the labor demand elasticity. 
Consistent with the results that the search model does not generate 
much uctuations when  = 0, the extent of labor market 
uctuations will be quite limited in this case also. 
Most estimates of the labor demand elasticity (with respect to wage) 
are less than 1 (see, e.g., Hamermesh, 1993). 
In general equilibrium, this follows because labor and capital are often 
estimated to be complements, which implies demand elasticities less 
than 1 for both. 
But it s also true when industry-level demand curves are estimated 
How can we measure the extent of real wage rigidity? 
Di cult, since how wages would move without rigidity is unclear.

First let s look at the search behavior of an unemployed worker. 
As usual, the worker is solving a straightforward dynamic 
programming problem, and his search behavior will be characterized 
by a reservation wage. 
Moreover, in this case the reservation wage is easy to pin down. 
Since there is no disutility and accepting a job does not reduce the 
future opportunities, an unemployed worker will accept all wages

s, giving us the simple ow equation 
u= s(1  u)  q () u
But in practice rms decide when to expand and contract, so it s a 
natural next step to endogenize s. 
Suppose that each rm consists of a single job (so we are now taking 
a position on for size).

To nd the steady state, we need to set N(w )= 0, which implies

Moreover, we have a similar law of motion for the distribution 
function G (w ). In particular, the total fraction of workers employed 
and getting paid the wage of less than or equal to w is 
(1  u) G (w ) 
The outow of workers from this group is equal to 
[s + p (1  F (w ))] (1  u) G (w )

However, employment rate of rms is endogenous. Imagine that the 
equilibrium wage distribution is given by G (w) and the oered wage 
distribution is F (w). 
Let us continue to restrict attention to steady states, where both of 
those are stationary. It is important that these two are not the same

Discussion (continued) 
The nice thing about the Burdett-Mortensen model is that it 
generates a wage dispersion together with employer-size dispersion, 
and it matches a very well-known stylized fact that larger employers 
pay higher wages. 
The typical interpretation for this is that larger employers attract 
higher-quality workers or somehow workers have greater bargaining 
power against such employers. 
Burdett-Mortensen turn this on its head; they argued that it is not 
that larger employers pay higher wages, it is that employers that pay 
higher wages become larger in equilibrium!

The structure of the equilibrium is similar to before, in particular the 
modied golden rule and the two wage equations are: 
Af 0(k) = r +  M.G.R.
w1 = ( 1  )z +  [Af (k)  (r + )k + 11]
w2 = ( 1  )z +  [Af (k)  (r + )k + 22]
The most important result here is that wage dierences between 
skilled unskilled workers are compressed. 
To illustrate this, let us take a simple case and suppose rst that 
1 = 2, n1 = n2, s1 = s2, z = 0. 
Thus there are no dierences in costs of creating vacancies, 
separation rates, unemployment benets, and population growth rates 
between skilled and unskilled workers.

Yet another way would be to make p more variable than labor

that this will go very far. 
In fact, what s happening is related to the cyclicality of wages. Recall 
that in the steady-state equilibrium, 
w = (1  )z +  [Af (k)  (r + )k + 0 ] .
Therefore, the elasticity of the wage with respect to p is in fact 
greater than 1 (since it comes both from the direct aect and from 
the changes in ); much of the productivity uctuations are absorbed 
by the wage.

Another possibility is to assume that wages are rigid . 
This is the avenue pursued by Hall (AER 2005). 
He argues that any distribution of the quasi-rent created by search 
frictions can be an equilibrium, and the exact level of wages is 
determined by social norms, and take this to be constant. 
If wages are constant, changes in p will translate into bigger changes 
in JF , and thus consequently to bigger changes in .

Intertemporal substitution vs target earning 
Camerer, et al (1997) 
Estimated wage  elasticities are signicantly negative ... Our inter -
pretation of t hese ndings is that cab drivers (at least inexperienced 
ones): (i) make labor supply decisions one day at a time instead of 
intertemporally substituting labor and leisure decisions across mul-
tiple days ( ii) set a loose daily income target and quit once they 
reach that target. 
Thaler (2015) 
Ub
er has d efended surge pricing on the basis that a higher price will 
act as an incentive for more drivers to work during peak periods. It 
is hard to evaluate this argument without seeing internal data on 
the supply response by drivers, but on the face of it the argument 
does not seem to be compelling. 
Farber (2005; c ommenting on Camerer) 
I am p uzzled by these ndings ... target earning implies that, on 
days when its easy to make money (pick low-hanging fruit, so to 
speak), drivers quit early, whereas on days when fares are scarce, 
drivers work longer hours. 
Making sense of target earning 
Target earning behavior can be motivated by two closely-related behavioral 
responses 
1. Within-period (d aily, for cab drivers) income eects in response to wealth-
neutral wage changes 
2. Reference-dependent pr eferences - very low or even zero MU(income) 
above some ex ante though perhaps malleable target. This induces some-
thing like a  discontinuous within-period wealth eect: earnings that push 
me across the target drive marginal utility way down; See Fehr and Goette 
(2007) for a formal exposition

 Perhaps s chooling does not boost productivity; rather, it reveals who the 
productive people are 
 In this case, we say: schooling is a signal, an idea that originates with 
Spence (1973) and Stiglitz (1975), rst tested empirically by Lang and 
Kropp (1986) 
 The idea  in a nutshell: 
1. Schooling is  easier (cheaper) to acquire for more productive workers 
but does not in and of itself make them so 
2. More pro ductive workers will nd it worthwhile to pay for schooling 
if the premium paid to more productive workers is high enough and 
the fact that they are more educated convinces employers they are 
more productive 
3. For less productive workers, the signal is too expensive relative to 
the pay gap so they do without 
4. Employers kn ow this, so in equilibrium the more educated get paid 
more, because their willingness to pay for schooling signals that they 
are indeed more productive 
 If things work out this way, its called a separating equilibrium

The Rothschild Critique 
The key ingredient of the McCall model is non-degenerate wage 
distribution F (w ). 
Where does this come from? 
Presumably somebody is oering every wage in the support of this 
distribution. 
Wage posting by rms. 
The basis of the Rothschild critique is that it is di cult to rationalize 
the distribution function F (w ) as resulting from prot-maximizing 
choices of rms.

The Rothschild Critique (continued) 
Imagine that the economy consists of a mass 1 of identical workers 
similar to our searching agent. 
On the other side, there are N rms that can productively employ 
workers. Imagine that rm j has access to a technology such that it 
can employ lj workers to produce 
yj = xjlj 
units of output (with its price normalized to one as the numeraire, so 
that w is the real wage). 
Suppose that each rm can only attract workers by posting a single 
vacancy. 
Moreover, to simplify the discussion, suppose that rms post a 
vacancy at the beginning of the game at t = 0, and then do not 
change the wage from then on. (why is this useful?)

Lemma 
There exists  &gt; 0 such that when almost all rms are oering w = R, 
it is optimal for each worker to use the following acceptance strategy: 
a (w )= 1 if w  max{R  , 0} 
= 0 otherwise 
So for any R &gt; 0, a rm can undercut the oers of all other rms and 
still have its oer accepted.

Unemployment with Sequential Search 
Suppose that there is now a continuum 1 of identical individuals 
sampling jobs from the same stationary distribution F . 
Once a job is created, it lasts until the worker dies, which happens 
with probability s. 
There is a mass of s workers born every period, so that population is 
constant 
New workers start out as unemployed. 
The death probability means that the eective discount factor of 
workers is equal to  (1  s). 
Consequently, the value of having accepted a wage of w is: 
w va (w )= .1   (1  s)

Understanding Comparative Advantage 
The simplest way of understanding why proportional comparative 
advantage is the right notion here is to consider the unit labor 
requirement of a job of type x for a worker of skill s. 
This is given by 
1l(x, s) = f (x, s) 
(this is the labor requirements for producing one unit of output). 
Then the unit cost function of rm x depending on the type of labor 
it hires is 
w (s)C (s|x) = w (s)l(x, s) = .f (x, s) 
This cost function, and the fact that rms will operate at the 
minimum of this cost, is independent of prices, so applies exactly even 
when prices are endogenous.

Implications of Comparative Advantage 
To understand the wage implications of strict comparative advantage, 
suppose that there is only weak (and no strict) comparative 
advantage, i.e., 
fxs (x, s)f (x, s) = fx (x, s)fs (x, s). 
(Or more formally, take the limit as we converge from strict to weak 
comparative advantage). 
This in particular implies that f is multiplicatively separable: 
f (x, s) = fx (x)fs (s). 
Then 
d log w (s)  log fs (s) = ,ds s 
and thus the wage distribution has the same shape as the skill 
distribution.

Now consider a shift from F to Fcorresponding to a mean preserving 
spread. 
This implies that Ew is unchanged 
But by denition of a mean preserving spread (second-order 
stochastic dominance), the last integral increases. 
Therefore, the mean preserving spread induces a shift in the 
reservation wage from R to R&gt; R.

Instead of assuming a xed set of rms with given distribution of job 
types, the same results also follows if there is one-to-one matching 
but free entry. 
Suppose the production function is again given by f (x, s), satisfying 
comparative advantage as dened above. 
This leads to positive assortative matching, i.e., (x) is strictly 
increasing.

Job Destruction 
What about job destruction? 
Let us start with the simplest model of job destruction, which is 
basically to treat it as exogenous . 
Think of it as follows, rms are hit by adverse shocks, and then they 
decide whether to destroy or to continue. 
 Adverse Shockdestroy

The unique steady-state unemployment rate where Ut+1 = Ut (or

sU = . s +(1  s) (1  F (R)) 
Canonical formula of the ow approach. 
The steady-state unemployment rate is equal to the job destruction 
rate (here the rate at which workers die, s) divided by the job 
destruction rate plus the job creation rate (here in fact the rate at 
which workers leave unemployment, which is dierent from the job 
creation rate). 
Clearly, an increases in s will raise steady-state unemployment. 
Moreover, an increase in R, that is, a higher reservation wage, will 
also depress job creation and increase unemployment.

Free entry implies that 0JF = q() 
Asset value equation for the value of a eld job: 
r (JF + k) = Af (k)  k  w  s(JF  JV ) 
Intuitively, the rm has two assets: the fact that it is matched with a 
worker, and its capital, k. 
So its asset value is JF + k (more generally, without the perfect 
reversability, we would have the more general JF (k)). 
Its return is equal to production, Af (k), and its costs are depreciation 
of capital and wages, k and w. 
Finally, at the rate s, the relationship comes to an end and the rm 
loses JF .

Gabaix and Landier provide a number of correlations consistent with 
the predictions of this wage equation. 
In particular, they show that CEO pay increases with an elasticity of 
about 0.35 with the rm s market capitalization and with an elasticity 
of 0.7 with the market capitalization of the largest 250th rm in the 
US market. 
They also show cross-country correlations consistent with these

A well-known result is that extreme value distributions take the form

fxs (x, s)f (x, s)  fx (x, s)fs (x, s). 
We will say that there is strict comparative advantage if this 
inequality is strict everywhere. 
Weak comparative advantage is equivalent to fs (x, s)/f (x, s) being 
nondecreasing in x, while strict comparative advantage corresponds to 
this being strictly increasing in x. This in particular implies that the 
increase in productivity due to greater skills is increasing in the 
complexity of the job. 
We will next see why this is the relevant condition.

In the cross-section, a 1% increase in rm size leads to a  percent  
increase in CEO pay. 
In the time series, a 1% increase in the size of all rms leads to a

Law of Motion of Unemployment 
Let us start time t with Ut unemployed workers. 
There will be s new workers born into the unemployment pool. 
Out of the Ut unemployed workers, those who survive and do not nd 
a job will remain unemployed. 
Therefore 
Ut+1 = s +(1  s) F (R)Ut . 
Here F (R) is the probability of not nding a job, so (1  s) F (R) is 
the joint probability of not nding a job and surviving. 
Simple rst-order linear dierence equation (only depending on the 
reservation wage R, which is itself independent of the level of 
unemployment, Ut ). 
Since (1  s) F (R) &lt; 1, it is asymptotically stable, and will converge 
to a unique steady-state level of unemployment.

w (s) w (s0) w (s0) w (s) and  .f (x, s) f (x, s0) f (x0 , s0) f (x0 , s)

As s0 s, this condition can be satised only if f satises (weak)

Existing aggregate evidence suggests that the assumption of x 
exhibiting CRS is reasonable. 
Intuitively, one might have expected increasing returns if the 
matching function corresponds to physical frictions

But the matching function is to reduced form for this type of 
interpretation. 
In practice, frictions due to dierences in the supply and demand for

Here is one argument: suppose that a manager of skill s makes a 
mistake and bankrupts the company with probability es , and has no

Then the expected contribution of the manager is

Equilibrium Wages 
Now equilibria wages can also be derived in a similar fashion. 
Given an assignment function (x), the equilibrium must satisfy for 
any s0 &gt; s: 
f (1(s0), s0)  w (s0)  f (1 (s0), s)  w (s) 
f (1(s))  w (s)  f (1 (s), s0)  w (s0) 
0Now take the rst inequality and set s= s + . As   0, this weak 
inequality becomes an equality. Dividing both sides of this 
relationship by  and taking limits, we have that w insert must also 
be dierentiable and satisfy 
dw (s) = fs (1(s), s).ds

This dierential equation can also be written as 
d log w (s)  log l(1(s), s)  log f (1 (s), s) =  = .ds s s 
This dierential equation, together with an appropriate boundary 
condition, denes a unique equilibrium wage function. 
The boundary condition is given by the requirement that the lowest 
type rm, x, employing the lowest type worker, s = (x), must make 
zero prots, and thus 
w (s) = f (x, s). 
In general, it is not possible to make much more progress without 
specifying some functional forms.

Summing these two inequalities, we obtain

Variable Labor Assignment Model 
Consider an economy based on Sattinger (1979) with a distribution of 
jobs (rms) of complexity x with distribution G (x), which is taken to 
be continuous for simplicity and its measure is normalized to 1. 
Each job can hire as many units of labor as it wishes. 
There is also a set of worker, each supplying one unit of labor 
inelastically. Each worker has a skill level s, with the distribution 
H(s), also assumed to be continuous. 
All workers have access to an outside wage w, which for now can be 
normalized to 0. 
We will characterize the equilibrium in terms of an assignment 
function, , such that in equilibrium s = (x) (or more generally 
s  (x) when we have a correspondence), and a wage function , 
w (s).

The question of e ciency boils down to whether these two 
externalities cancel each other or whether one of them dominates. 
To analyze this question more systematically, consider a social planner 
subject to the same constraints, intending to maximize total 
surplus , in other words, pursuing a utilitarian objective. 
First ignore discounting, i.e., r  0, and letting the value of a match 
be y (e.g., y = Af (k)  (r + )k), we have that the planner s 
problem can be written as 
max SS 
u, = (1  u)y + uz  u0.

than unemployment benets (how would this be dierent if z were

Bottom Line 
The bottom line is that there are theoretically interesting reasons to 
think that CEO pay explosion may be due to rent seeking or may be 
due to market forces. 
There are correlations in the data that could be consistent with either. 
Probably both of them are going on, and the relative weights are 
unknown. 
So one should probably not jump to strong conclusions, and instead 
see if there are empirical strategies that could estimate their relative 
contributions to the CEO pay increase.

Suppose that a rm of type x and a worker of type s jointly produce 
revenue 
f (x, s) 
which is assumed to be twice dierentiable and strictly increasing in 
s, which corresponds to absolute advantage. 
We will study competitive equilibria where the labor market for each 
type of skill clears with a wage w (s). 
When a competitive equilibrium exists, it will also be e cient, so it 
can be studied as a solution to a planner s problem as well. 
In what follows, we will assume that all types of rms will be active 
(i.e., the market will not be dominated by just one type of rm etc.).

Central question for labor and macro: what determines the level of

Textbook answer: labor supply, labor demand, and unemployment as

Neither realistic nor a useful framework for analysis. 
Alternative: labor market frictions 
Related questions raised by the presence of frictions:

Implications of Comparative Advantage (continued) 
Conversely, when there is strict comparative advantage, i.e.,

we have that high skill workers earn more than what would be implied 
by the inequality in skills.

so that high skill workers earn more relative to low skill workers than 
would be implied by their productivity dierences in the xed job. 
Sattinger (1979) also shows that this condition leads to right-skewed 
wage distributions.

The Beverage Curve 
This relationship is also referred to as the Beveridge Curve , or the 
U-V curve. 
It draws a downward sloping locus of unemployment-vacancy 
combinations in the U-V space that are consistent with ow into 
unemployment being equal with ow out of unemployment. 
Some authors interpret shifts of this relationship is reecting 
structural changes in the labor market, but we will see that there are 
many factors that might actually shift at a generalized version of such 
relationship.

          <text>Theorem
(Rothschild Paradox) When all workers are homogeneous and engage in
undirected search, all equilibrium distributions will have a mass point at
their reservation wage R.w R, and there is no distribution and no search.Paradoxes of Search Paradoxes of Search 
Equilibrium Wage Distribution? 
The answer is no. 
Previous analysis: all workers will use a reservation wage, so 
a (w )= 1 if w  R 
= 0 otherwise 
Since all workers are identical and the equation above determining the 
reservation wage, (5), has a unique solution, all workers will all be 
using the same reservation rule, accepting all wages w  R and 
turning down those w &lt; R. 
Workersstrategies are therefore again characterized by a reservation 
wage R. 
Next consider a rm oering a wage w&lt; R. 
This wage will be rejected by all workers, and the rm would lose the 
cost of posting a vacancy. 
Therefore, in equilibrium when workers use the reservation wage rule 
of accepting only wages greater than R, all rms will oer the same

Extreme Value Theory (continued) 
In particular, working with the percentile of the rm type q (rather 
than rm characteristic x), the assignment function approximately 
takes the form 
0 (q)= B1 , (7) 
for constants  and B. 
The approximation here is that there might be a slowly varying 
function multiplying this. In particular, L is a slowly-varying function 
if for all u &gt; 0, we have that limx 0+ L (uq) /L (q)= 1, which will 
make the contribution from this slowly-varying function disappear for 
the top (right tail) of the distribution. 
Gabaix and Landier work with this functional form to get specic 
predictions for the top of the income distribution (driven by 
managers, even if not entirely consisting of managers).

3 How do we resolve this paradox? 
By assumption: assume that F (w ) is not the distribution of wages, 
but the distribution of fruits exogenously oered by trees . This is 
clearly unsatisfactory, both from the modeling point of view, and from 
the point of view of asking policy questions from the model (e.g., how 
does unemployment insurance aect the equilibrium? The answer will 
depend also on how the equilibrium wage distribution changes). 
Introduce other dimensions of heterogeneity. 
Modify the wage determination assumptionsbargaining rather than 
wage posting: the most common and tractable alternative (though is 
it the most realistic?)

The Shape of CEO Pay 
A closely related paper by Gabaix and Landier (2006) pushes the 
assignment model of CEO pay further in three dimensions: 
It identies x with rm size empirically. 
It proposes a specic shape for the distribution of skill based on 
1 
2 
3 extreme value theory. 
It confronts the predictions of such a model with data. 
The conclusion of Gabaix and Landier (2006) even more strongly than 
Tervio s is that the major outlines of the increase in CEO pay can be 
accounted by competitive market forces.

Comparison to Equilibrium 
Recall that in equilibrium (with r = 0) we have 
s + q()(1  )(y  z)  0 = 0. q() 
Comparing these two conditions we nd that e ciency obtains if and 
only if the Hosios condition

is satised 
In other words, e ciency requires the bargaining power of the worker 
to be equal to the elasticity of the matching function with respect to 
unemployment. 
This is only possible if the matching function is constant returns to

One-to-One Matching 
Consider next the case of one-to-one matching, again with production 
function f (x, s). In this situation, if an equilibrium assignment is 
given by , then we must have 
0 0f (x, (x0))  w ((x0))  f (x, (x))  w ((x)) 
f (x, (x))  w ((x))  f (x, (x0))  w ((x0)) 
This immediately suggests that the relevant condition for positive 
assortative matching in this case will be not log supermodularity, but 
supermodularity . 
In other words, the right notion of comparative advantage will be 
level comparative advantage requiring that 
0 0f (x, s0) + f (x, s)  f (x, s0) + f (x, s).

          <text>Assignment Models 
Assignment Models 
An alternative and complement to the search models are the 
assignment models in which heterogeneous workers are assigned to 
heterogeneous rms but in a frictionless manner. 
These models were rst proposed by Tinbergen (1956) and Koopman 
and Beckman (1957). 
We will now review a basic version of assignment models and then 
show how they can be applied to the analysis of CEO market and 
generate implications about superstar phenomena. 
In fact, there turns out to be two related but distinct assignment 
models: 
1 Variable labor assignment models (where each job/task can hire as 
many units of labor as it wishes, so that there is many-to-one 
matching). 
These models also usually feature endogenous prices for jobs/tasks, 
since otherwise the most productive ones may hire all workers. 
2 Fixed labor assignment models (where each job can hire at most one 
worker, so that there is one-to-one matching).

Prices 
Prices can be introduced straightforwardly into this framework. 
First, there might be a given set of prices, p(x), for the goods 
produced by dierent types of rms. This can be combined with the f 
function without any complication. 
Second, these prices might be endogenously determined as a function 
of the level of production (and thus the skill levels of workers assigned 
to specic jobs). 
The approach here does not make assumptions on prices. 
But prices might play an important role in ensuring that all types of 
rms are active.

But there will still be dynamics nonemployment because job creation

We will later see how important these dynamics could be.

          <text>Assignment Models The Market for CEOs 
The Market for CEOs 
An obvious application of these models is to the market for CEOs, 
e.g., Tervio (2008). 
All of the characterization above applies, except that now we should 
think of x is some characteristic of the rm and s the skill of the 
candidate manager. 
Tervio also argued that x should be related to the rm s market 
value, so that higher market value (higher size) rms should hire more 
skilled managers. (Baker, Jensen and Murphy, 1988, Baker and Hall, 
2004, as well as Gabaix and Landier, 2006, provide evidence for this). 
One important implication is that when f exhibits supermodularity, 
the compensation for managers at the top, even if they are only 
slightly more skilled than other managers could be very high. 
Tervio also propose that calibration method to make inferences from 
this sort of model. 
This approach also suggests that very high salaries for CEOs might be 
a result of competitive market forces, not rent-seeking.

f (x, s) = w (s) and 
0f (x, s0)  w (s0), for any s. 
Now divide both sides of the inequality by the quality for type s to 
obtain 
f (x, s0) w (s0) ,f (x, s) w (s)

Gabaix and Landier also posit that the rm size distribution is Pareto, 
i.e., 
n(q) = Aq . 
This equation with  approximately equal to 1 appears to be a good 
approximation to the US rm size distribution, for example. 
Now combining this with (7) and (8), we have 
AB ()w (q) = q ,   
where we assume that    &gt; 0. 
Note that as anticipated already, the earning distribution is much 
more disperse at the top than the skill distribution. For example, if 
 &gt; 0, there is an upper bound to manager skill. But wages at the 
very top of are unbounded.

Generalizations 
Now suppose that with probability q, an individual does not have the 
ability to acquire skills (which we denote by (t) = 0). 
Then the equilibrium correspondence becomes a stochastic 
correspondence, taking the form 
 
 (wu +(1 + r ) (wu + x (t))) if x (t) &lt; f  (wu +(1 + i) x (t)) if h &gt; x (t)  f &amp; (t) = 0 
x (t + 1)=  (ws +(1 + i) (x (t)  h)) if h &gt; x (t)  f &amp; (t) = 1 
 (wu +(1 + r ) (x (t)+ wu )) if x (t)  h &amp; (t) = 0  
(ws +(1 + r ) (x (t)  h)) if x (t)  h &amp; (t) = 1 
What does the limiting distribution look like in this case? Does it 
generate social mobility? Is that the right type of social mobility?

of each individual and the behavior of the wealth distribution in the 
economy (Markovian ). 

Dene x as the intersection of the equilibrium curve (4) with the 45

Such an intersection will exist when the borrowing interest rate, i, is

An Application to Job Placement Assistance 
In some contexts, contextual eects are natural. In such contexts, if 
we can also nd (or design) random assignment, then credible 
estimates can be obtained. 
A nice example is provided by recent work by Crepon et al. (2014). 
A randomized job placement assistance oers across young, educated 
job-seekers in France, using both randomization across individuals 
within a labor market and also across labor markets. 
This enables them to estimate both the own eect of job placement 
assistance and the spillover eect of other workers in the labor market 
receiving such assistance.

associated with credit constraints?) 
Children s education may also be a consumption good, so rich parents 
will consume more of this good as well as other goods. 
The distribution of costs and benets of education dier across 
families, and are likely to be correlated with income.

Workings of the City (continued) 
The important observation here is that only segregated city equilibria 
are stable . 
To see this consider an integrated city equilibrium, and imagine 
relocating a fraction  of the high-skill individuals (that is individuals 
getting high skills) from neighborhood 1 to neighborhood 2. 
This will reduce the cost of education in neighborhood 2, both for 
high and low skill individuals. 
But by assumption, it reduces it more for high skill individuals, so all 
high skill individuals now will pay higher rents to be in that city, and 
they will outbid low-skill individuals, taking the economy toward the 
segregated city equilibrium.

Determinants of Social Mobility 
What could determine social mobility? 
Credit market constraints and inequality, the Great Gatsby curve (as 
we will see next). 
Peer eects and residential/social sorting (as we will also see next). 
Inequality and rewards to success (as we will also discuss later). 
Policy. 
Sociological factors. 
Before studying the theories, let s look at some of the data

          <text>Social Mobility, Peer Eects and Human Capital Intergenerational Linkages 
Interpreting the Evidence 
To elaborate on this, consider the following simple model: 
ln yit =  +  ln yit1 + it , 
yit is the income of t-th generation of dynasty i, and it is serially 
independent disturbance term with variance 2 
 . 
Then the long-term (stationary distribution) variance of log income is: 
2 
2 = (2)y 1  2 
(To derive this, set 2 
y ,t1 = y 2 
,t ; why is that the right thing to do?) 
Using the estimate of 0.2 for , equation (2) implies that the 
long-term variance of log income will be only about 4 percent higher 
than 2 
 . 
Therefore, the long-run income distribution will largely reect 
transitory shocks to dynastiesincomes and skills  not inherited 
dierences. (But inequality could be very large if 2 is large.)

Segregation and Mixing (continued) 
The complementarity in the human capital production function has two 
implications: 
1 It is socially e cient, in the sense of maximizing the sum of human 
capitals, to have parents with good backgrounds to send their 
children to school with other parents with good backgrounds. 
This follows simply from the denition of complementarity, positive 
cross-partial derivative, which is clearly veried by the production 
functions in (13). 
2 It will also be an equilibrium outcome that parents will do so.

Modeling Social Mobility 
Let us next turn to modeling social mobility. 
I will present three sets of models emphasizing dierent aspects: 
The role of credit constraints and inequality in social mobility. 
The role of rewards to success in social mobility. 
1 
2 
3 The role of community structure/segregation/school structure in social 
mobility. 
The last topic will then act as a segue into the discussion of peer 
eects more generally.

Workings of the City (continued) 
In contrast, the segregated city equilibrium is always stable. 
Thus segregation arises as the equilibrium (stable equilibrium) 
outcome, because of complementarities . 
As in the previous model with spillovers between students within the 
school, high-skill individuals can outbid the low-skill individuals 
because they benet more from the peer group eects of high skill 
individuals. 
But crucially there are again missing markets in this economy. 
In particular, rather than paying high skill individuals for the positive 
externalities that they create, as would be the case in complete 
markets, agents transact simply through the housing market. 
In the housing market, there is only one rent level, which both high 
and low skill individuals pay. 
In contrast, with complete markets, housing prices would be such that 
high skill individuals pay a lower rent (to be compensated for the 
positive externality that they are creating on the other individuals).

The results are very dierent when the human capital production 
function features negative cross-partial derivatives, 
2f (e1, e2)/e1e2 &lt; 0 or exhibits submodularity . 
For example, we might have 
1/2 1/2 = e h1 e1 + e2  e1 2 
1/2 1/2 = e1 + e2  e e h2 1 2 
where  &gt; 1 and  &gt; 0 but small, so that human capital is increasing 
in parental background. 
In this case, background characteristics or resources are substitutes . 
This can be thought as corresponding to the good apple theory of 
the classroom, where the kids with the best characteristics and 
attitudes bring the rest of the class up.

Shortcomings of the Model 
No social mobility in the long run. 
Does inequality lead to lower or greater social mobility? 
The answer is unclear: if by increasing inequality, you push more people 
above the threshold f , then you increase mobility (and e ciency), but if 
you push more people below the threshold, then the opposite happens. 
Theoretically, this is a partial equilibrium model: 
Models in which prices determined in general equilibrium aect wealth 
(income) dynamics may be more relevant (and also may have some 
additional robust features as we describe next).

Segregation and Mixing (continued) 
A potential confusion in the literature (especially in the applied 
literature): deducing complementarity from the fact that in 
equilibrium we do observe segregation; 
e.g., rich parents sending their children to private schools with other 
children from rich parents, or living in suburbs and sending their 
children to suburban schools, while poor parents live in ghettos and 
children from disadvantaged backgrounds go to school with other 
disadvantaged children in inner cities. 
This reasoning is often used in discussions of Tiebout competition , 
together with the argument that allowing parents with dierent 
characteristics/tastes to sort into dierent neighborhoods will often 
be e cient.

They report on the log-log correlation coe cient, but also two other 
measures:

where rank it is the rank of family i the income distribution of cohort t

Evidence (continued) 
One thing is fairly clear: parents are willing to pay for their children 
to be together with high human capital peers (and with peers from 
good social economic background and in schools with various 
dimensions of higher quality). 
One nice illustration of this comes from Sandra Black s work focusing 
on parentswillingness to pay for housing is a function of school 
quality. 
She focuses on variation within school districts across hous es lying 
on dierent sides of attendance district boundaries, which determine 
which limit entry school child will go to. 
These households are subject to the same taxes and have the same 
access to other non-elementary school amenities (safety, public 
services etc.). 
But parents are willing to pay 2.5% more for houses for a 5% increase 
in test scores.

Workings of the City 
We have seen how ine cient segregation can occur in the presence of 
submodularity or substitute property. 
A very interesting paper by Benabou shows that even with 
supermodularity ine cient segregation can occur because of other 
missing markets . 
His model has competitive labor markets, and local externalities 
(externalities in schooling in the local area). 
All agents are assumed to be ex ante homogeneous, and will 
ultimately end up either low skill or high skill. 
Utility of agent i is assumed to be 
Ui i  ci  ri = w
where w is the wage, c is the cost of education, which is necessary to 
become both low skill or high skill, and r is rent.

The alternative is what Manski refers to as endogenous eects  
because they are created by endogenous variables. 
The simplest form would be 
 yij = xij + spillover Yj + ij (16)own
 where Y is the average of the outcomes.
The identication of such endogenous eects is even more di cult 
(though this hasn t stopped people estimating such models).

This framework highlights various dierent costs arising from income 
inequality. 
But somewhat reduced form : what are the micro interactions 
leading to segregation and also costs of inequality? 
I will not discuss costs of inequality given our focus, but these could 
be better micro-founded, though at the end we do not have great 
evidence that there are indeed productivity costs from greater 
inequality of human capital in the economy as a whole (as opposed to 
within a given rm etc.).

Segregation and Mixing 
Let us return to the same question posed above: from the viewpoint 
of human capital production e ciency is it better to have 
segregation or mixing of students by dierent 
abilities/achievements/social economic backgrounds? 
The basic issue here is equivalent to an assignment problem. 
The general principle in assignment problems, such as Becker s 
famous model of marriage, is that if inputs from the two parties are 
complementary,  there should be assortative matching, that is the 
highest quality individuals should be matched together. 
In the context of schooling, assortative matching implies that children 
with better characteristics will be segregated in their own schools, and 
children with worse characteristics should go to separate schools. 
This practically means segregation along income lines, since often 
children with better characteristics are those from better parental 
backgrounds, while children with worse characteristics are often from 
lower socioeconomic backgrounds

Multiple steady states here may not be robust to addition of noise in

stationary distribution of human capital levels. 
In particular, suppose  is a random variable, and change the law of 
motion of wealth to: 
 
 bu =  ((1 + r ) (wu + x (t)) + wu )+  if x (t) &lt; f 
x (t + 1)= bs =  (ws +(1 + i) (x (t)  h)) +  if h &gt; x (t)  f  bn =  (ws +(1 + r ) (x (t)  h)) +  if x (t)  h

Peer Eects 
How segregation of families by socioeconomic status (and 
organization of schools) aects human capital accumulation is related 
to the literature on peer eects. 
There may be technological human capital externalities in the 
classroom (e.g., learning from peers, teamwork). 
There may also be other, more sociological eects: children 
growing up in dierent areas and with dierent peers may choose 
dierent role models. 
But important theoretical and empirical challenges in understanding 
and estimating peer eects.

The cost of education is assumed to depend on the fraction of the 
agents in the neighborhood, denoted by x, who become high skill. In 
particular, we have cH (x) and cL (x) as the costs of becoming high 
skill and low skill. 
Both costs are decreasing in x, meaning that when there are more 
individuals acquiring high skill, becoming high skill is cheaper 
(positive peer group eects). 
In addition, 
cH (x) &gt; cL (x) 
so that becoming high skill is always more expensive.

Education: binary outcome, and educated (skilled) workers earn wage

Expenditure to become skilled is h, and not earn the unskilled wage 
wu during the rst period. 
Binary education: introduces a nonconvexity. 
Imperfect capital markets: some amount of monitoring required for 
loans to be paid back. 
Cost of monitoring: wedge between the borrowing and the lending

Though exceptions exist, it is natural to assume that there are 
positive externalities in this context: higher human capital pupils 
create positive learning/teamwork/role model externalities on their 
classmates. 
Also, richer individuals live in more expensive neighborhoods, 
generating greater tax revenue and thus schools in such 
neighborhoods tend to have access to greater resources. 
But this does not answer the question of whether these inputs are 
complements or substitutes.

Since all agents are ex ante identical, in equilibrium we must have 
U (L)= U (H) 
that is, the utility of becoming high skill and low skill must be the 
same. 
Assume that the labor market in the economy is global, and takes the 
constant returns to scale form F (H, L). 
The important implication here is that irrespective of where the 
worker obtains his education, he will receive the same wage as a 
function of his skill level. 
Also assume that there are two neighborhoods of xed size, and 
individuals will compete in the housing market to locate in one 
neighborhood or the other.

Now returning to the above equation, estimates of  around 0.2 mean 
that if your parents are twice as rich as my parents, you will typically 
be about 20 percent as rich as me. Your children will be only 4 
percent richer than my children! 
With this degree of intergenerational dependence, dierences in initial 
conditions will soon disappear converges to a relatively

Instead, the marginal willingness to pay of a low-background parent 
to stay in the school with the high-background parents is 
f (el , eh )  f (el , el ). 
The denition of supermodularity is that 
f (eh, eh ) + f (el , el ) &gt; f (eh, el ) + f (el , eh ), 
and this immediately follows from positive cross-partial derivatives, 
2f (e1, e2)/e1e2 &gt; 0. 
Thus the willingness to pay of high-background parents always 
exceeds that of low-background parents. 
Therefore, the high-background parent can always outbid the 
low-background parent for the privilege of sending his children to 
school with other high-background parents. 
Thus with prot maximizing schools, segregation will arise as the 
outcome.

Limitations 
One limitations about the functional forms. The linearity (or log 
linearity) rules out the possibility of mobility traps in some part of 
the distribution. 
Cooper, Durlauf and Johnson nd that there are important 
heterogeneities. 
In particular, using the PSID, they nd that while mobility estimate 
for the entire sample is 0.34, focusing on families living the poorest 
33%, this coe cient increases to 0.46. 
But perhaps the most important limitation of the earlier work was 
data quality.

Plausible if presence of some low human capital children will slow

Include other characteristics to proxy for the costs and benets of

When parentseducation is also included in the regression, the role of 
income is substantially reduced. 
Conclusion? 
Two considerations: 
1 First, parentsincome may aect more the quality of education, 
especially through the choice of the neighborhood in which the family 
lives. 
2 Parental income is often measured with error, and has a signicant 
transitory component, so parental education may be a much better 
proxy for permanent income than income observations in these data 
sets.

An Example of Submodularity

Fullerton and West (2009) exploits the random assignment of cadets 
to dierent squadrons in the U.S. Air Force Academy, they have 
convinced U.S. Air Force to change the composition of squadrons. 
The results in the earlier study, using random assignment resulting 
from the existing policy of the U.S. Air Force, show that low ability 
cadets (students) benet most from high ability peers in their 
squadron. 
We will discuss this paper more in the next lecture, but for now it

The underlying idea can be illustrated using the following simple 
model. 
Suppose that schools consist of two kids, and denote the parental 
background (e.g., home education or parental expenditure on 
non-school inputs) of kids by e, and the resulting human capitals by h. 
Suppose 
hi = f (ei , ei ), (13) 
And this implies of course 
h1 = f (e1, e2) and h2 = f (e2, e1 ). 
Throughout, we will assume positive externalities: 
h1/e2 = f (e1, e2 )/e2 &gt; 0 and h2/e1 = f (e2, e1)/e1 &gt; 0.

Evidence 
What does the evidence say? 
A lot of uncertainty (for reasons we will discuss in the next lecture). 
Positive externalities are probably present in several dierent settings. 
School quality seems to matter, but in several instances, selective 
schools do not seem to have a positive eect on (marginally-admitted) 
students either evidence that in this instance quality does not matter 
or strong supermodularity. 
Few papers look at the issue of supermodularity vs. submodularity, 
and the answer is like you to depend on the specic context also. 
Let us start with a discussion of the estimation of peer eects.

Borjas (1994, 1995) suggested that these are related to the eect of 
ethnic capital  meaning that if in a group has low human capital, 
then the next generation will be at a disadvantage in human capital 
acquisition.

This type of supermodularity implies that parental backgrounds are 
complementary, and each kid s human capital will depend mostly on 
his own parent s background, but also on that of the other kid in the 
school. 
For example, it may be easier to learn or be motivated when other 
children in the class are also motivated. 
We can think of this as the bad apple theory of classroom: one bad 
kid in the classroom brings down everybody (Lazear).

Social Mobility More Directly 
This motivates a simpler and at some level more interesting approach: 
measure intergenerational mobility and earnings. 
The typical regression here is 
log child income=controls +   log parental income (1) 
Regressions of this sort were rst investigated by Becker and Tomes. 
They found relatively small coe cients, typically in the neighborhood 
of 0.2. 
This would be particularly striking since there is a signicant amount 
of inheritability of various income-earning characteristics (including 
IQ). For example, the literature nds a correlation of IQ between 
parents and ospring between 0.42 and 0.72. (There is also similar 
evidence from twin studies.) 
Though some of this is because of better education and resources 
leading to higher IQ of the ospring, it suggests a signicant 
genetic inheritance.

the outcome of the ith individual in group j. 
This is the model we discussed in the context of human capital 
externalities. 
Manski (1993) calls this type of inuences contextual eects  they 
come from the context in which the individual is situated. 
As we have already discussed, identication here will require some 
structural assumptions or preferably exogenous variation in both xij
andX .

Digression 
Notice an important feature of the way we wrote (13) linking the 
outcome variables, h1 and h2, to predetermined characteristics of 
children e1 and e2, which creates a direct analogy with the human 
capital externalities discussed above. 
However, this may simply be the reduced form of that somewhat 
dierent model, for example, 
h1 = H1 (e1, h2) (14) 
h2 = H2 (e2, h1) 
whereby each individual s human capital depends on his own 
background and the human capital choice of the other individual. 
Although in reduced form (13) and (14) are very similar, they provide 
dierent interpretations of peer group eects, and econometrically 
they pose dierent challenges, which we will discuss below.

An Application (continued) 
Despite the very nice nature of the experiment, the conclusion is 
problematic, because Sacerdote attempts to identify (16) rather than 
(15). 
For example, to the extent that there are common shocks to both 
roommates; 
e.g., they are in a noisier dorm), this may not reect peer group eects.
This identication problem would not have arisen if the right-hand 
side regressor was some predetermined characteristic of the roommate 
in this case, we would be estimating something similar to (15) rather 
than (16).

Segregation and Mixing (continued) 
In this case, because the cross-partial derivative is negative, the 
marginal willingness to pay of low-background parents to have their 
kid together with high-background parents is higher than that of 
high-background parents. 
With perfect markets, we will observe mixing, and in equilibrium 
schools will consist of a mixture of children from high- and 
low-background parents. 
Now combining the outcomes of these two models, many people jump 
to the conclusion that since we do observe segregation of schooling in 
practice, parental backgrounds must be complementary, so 
segregation is in fact e cient, and that Tiebout competition and 
parental sorting will increase e ciency. 
However, this conclusion is not correct; even if the correct production 
function does have the substitute property, segregation would arise in 
the presence of credit market problems or under reasonable limitations 
on prices.

When it is convex, it means that it is best to choose the same level of

Segregation and Mixing (continued) 
Payments from poor backgrounds families to better o families to 
ensure mixing are both di cult to implement in practice, and 
practically impossible taking into account the credit market problems 
facing parents from poor socioeconomic status. 
Therefore, if the true production function exhibits the substitute 
property (submodularity), but there are credit market problems, we 
will observe segregation in equilibrium, and the segregation will be 
ine cient. 
This implies that we cannot simply appeal to Tiebout competition, or 
deduce e ciency from the equilibrium patterns of sorting. 
Another implication of this analysis is that in the absence of credit 
market problems (and with complete markets), cross-partials 
determine the allocation of students to schools. 
With credit market problems, rst there of it has become important. 
This is a general result, with a range of implications for empirical 
work.

Segregation and Mixing (continued) 
The way that mixing is supposed to occur with substitutes is that 
low-background parents make a payment to high-background parents 
so that the latter send their children to a mixed school. 
To see why such payments are necessary, recall that we always have 
that the rst derivatives are positive, that is 
h1 h2 &gt; 0 and &gt; 0. e2 e1 
This means that everything else being equal all children benet from 
being in the same class with other children with good backgrounds. 
However, children from better backgrounds benet less than children 
from less good backgrounds. This implies that there has to be 
payments from parents of less good backgrounds to high-background 
parents.

What does this say about credit market problems? 
Persistence of about 0.3 is not very dierent from what we might 
expect to result simply from the inheritance of IQ between parents 
and children, or from the children s adoption of cultural values 
favoring education from their parents. 
Therefore, relatively small eect of parents income on children s

Endogenous Networks 
A large literature studies the endogenous formation of (social) 
networks e.g., Jackson and Wolinsky (JET, 1996), Bala and Goyal 
(Econometrica, 2000). 
Endogeneity of networks makes externalities and peer eects more 
interesting but also more complicated conceptually and more di cult 
to estimate. 
Let us return to Carrell, Sacerdote, and West (Econometrica, 2013). 
Recall that the peer eects they are estimating from the cadets within 
squadrons using random assignment from the U.S. Air Force 
Academy are non-linear. 
Low (baseline) ability students appear to benet signicantly from 
being in the same squadron has high-ability students with 
limitednegative eect on high-ability students from such mixin. 
This suggests that optimally manipulating the composition of 
squadrons can lead to signicant gains.

Endogenous Networks: Intervention Gone Wrong 
The authors convinced the U.S. Air Force Academy to allow such 
manipulation, and constructed optimally designed squadrons in 
which the exposure of low-ability cadets to high-ability ones was 
maximized by creating bimodal squadrons. 
However, instead of the hypothesized gains, there were losses among 
low-ability cadets. Why? 
The authors hypothesize, and provides some evidence in favor of, the 
following story: 
The real peer groups the friendship networks probably changed as a 
result of the intervention: low-ability and high-ability cadets may have 
stopped working and being friends together in the bimodal squadrons. 
As a result, the peer eects from high-ability to low-ability cadets 
weakened or disappeared, leading to negative results. 
A cautionary tale on the endogeneity of social networks with respect 
to interventions.

Chevalier and Ellison look at the behavior of fund managers in the 
early 1990s, and nd that the possibility of termination (as a function 
of their performance) creates career concerns for these managers. In 
particular, the prevailing termination policies make the probability of 
termination a convex function of performance for young managers. 
Highlighting that the setting matters for that form of career concerns 
(in this case driven by convexity of termination), their results suggest 
that younger fund managers avoid (unsystematic) risk and hold more 
conventional portfolios

Can we have perfect risk sharing? 
This would require 
V 0(x  s(x))/U0(s(x)) = constant. 
Since V 0 is constant, this is only possible if U0 is constant. 
Since the agent is risk-averse, so that U is strictly concave, this is 
only possible if s (x) is constant. 
But if s (x) is constant and eort is costly, the incentive compatibility 
constraint will be violated (unless the optimal contract asks for 
a = 0).

(as long as it follows a normal process). 
For example, we could have

0  N (m0, 1/h0 )

Robustness: Key Result 
In this case, optimal contracts are only a function of (cumulative) 
output x1 and are linear. 
Independent of the exact sample path leading to the cumulative 
output. 
Moreover, in response to this contract the optimal behavior of the 
agent is to choose a constant level of eort, which is also independent 
of the history of past realizations of the stochastic shock. 
Loose intuition: with any nonlinear contract there will exist an event, 
i.e., a sample path, after which the incentives of the agent will be 
distorted, whereas the linear contract achieves a degree of 
robustness .

Consider a model in continuous time. 
The interaction between the principal and the agent take place over 
an interval normalized to [0, 1]. 
The agent chooses an eort level at  A at each instant after 
observing the relaxation of output up to that instant. 
The output process is given by the continuous time random walk, 
that is, the following Brownian motion process: 
dxt = atdt + dWt 
where W is a standard Brownian motion (Wiener process). 
This implies that its increments are independent and normally

normally with variance equal to .

Let us now modify the above linear model so that there are two 
eorts that the individual chooses, a1 and a2, with a cost function 
c (a1, a2 ) 
which is increasing and convex as usual. 
These eorts lead to two outcomes: 
x1 = a1 + 1 
and 
x2 = a2 + 2, 
where 1 and 2 could be correlated. 
The principal cares about both of these inputs with potentially 
dierent weights, so her return is

Back to the Optimal Contract 
Let the level of eort that the principal wants to implement be a. 
Then the optimal contract solves: 
V 0(x  s(x)) fa(x | a) =  +  .U0(s(x)) f (x | a) 
If a (x) &gt; a, then 
fa (x | a)/f (x | a) &gt; 0 
so V 0/U0 has to be greater, which means that U0 has to be lower. 
Therefore s (x) must be increasing in x. 
Intuitively, when the realization of output is good news relative to 
what was expected, the agent is rewarded, when it is bad news, he is 
punished.

Dierently from the basic moral hazard model this is an equilibrium 
model, in the sense that there are other rms out there who can hire 
this agent. This is the source of the career concerns. 
Loosely speaking, a higher perception of the market about the ability 
of the agent, , will translate into higher wages. 
This class of models are also referred to as signal jamming models, 
since the agent might have an interest in working harder in order to 
improve the perception of the market about his ability.

Main dierence: only x1 is observed, while x2 is unobserved. 
Example: the agent is a home contractor where x1 is an inverse 
measure of how long it takes to nish the contracted work, while x2 is 
the quality of the job, which is not observed until much later, and 
consequently, payments cannot be conditioned on this. 
Another example: the behavior of employees in the public sector, 
where quality of the service provided to citizens is often di cult to 
contract on.

Why?: because there are two leakages (increases in output that the 
agent does not capture): the payo from higher eort only occurs 
next period, therefore its value is discounted to , and the agent only 
gets credit for a fraction h/(h0 + h) of her eort, the part that is

Greater  means that the agent discounts the future less, so exerts 
more eort because the rst source of leakage is reduced. 
Greater h implies that there is less variability in the random 
component of performance. This, from the normal updating formula, 
implies that any given increase in performance is more likely to be 
attributed to ability, so the agent is more tempted to jam the signal 
by exerting more eort.

For example, Lazear s evidence shows that when this particular 
company went from xed salaries to piece rates productivity rose by 
35% because of greater eort by the employees (the increase in average 
wages was 12%), but part of this response might be due to selection,

          <text>Training in Competitive Markets Training with Contractual Problems 
Training with Incomplete Contracts 
To capture these issues let us make the timing of events regarding the 
provision of training somewhat more explicit. 
At time t = 1/2, the rm makes a training-wage contract oer 
(0 , w0 ). Workers accept oers from rms. 
At time t = 0, there is an initial production of y0, the rm pays w0, 
and also unilaterally decides the level of training , which could be 
dierent from the promised level of training 0 . 
At time t = 1/2, wage oers are made, and the worker decides 
whether to quit and work for another rm. 
At time t = 1, there is the second and nal period of production, 
where output is equal to y1 + f ().

Wage-Tenure Relationship (continued) 
Therefore, whenever Tit = 0, the disturbance term it in (9) is likely 
to be positively selected. 
According to this reasoning, we can obtain a lower bound estimate of 
2, 2, using a two-step procedure rst estimate the rate of 
within-job wage growth, 1, and then subtract from this the estimate 
of the experience premium obtained from entry-level jobs 
can you see reasons why this will lead to an upwardly biased estimate 
of the importance of tenure rather than a lower bound on tenure 
aects as Topel claims?.

Equilibrium 
Consider a worker with belief . 
If this worker produces output yh, then Bayes s rule implies that his 
posterior (belief) next period should be 
p0 h ()  &gt; , p +(1  ) q 
Similarly, following an output realization of yl , the belief of the worker 
will be 
 (1  p)0 l ()  &lt; .  (1  p)+(1  ) (1  q) 
Finally, let us also assume that every time a worker changes jobs, he 
has to incur a training or mobility cost equal to   0.

Results 
Provided that 0  (0, 1),  will never converge to 0 or 1 in nite 
time. Therefore, a worker who generates high output will have higher 
wages in the following period, and a worker who generates low output 
will have lower wages in the following period. Thus, in this model 
worker wages will move with past performance. 

It can be easily proved that if  = 0, then  = 0. This implies that 
when  is equal to 0 or is very small, a worker who starts a job and 
generates low output will quit immediately. Therefore, as long as  is 
not very high, there will be a high likelihood of separation in new jobs. 
Next consider a worker who has been in a job for a long time. Such 
workers will on average have high values of , since they have never 
experienced (on this job) a belief less than  . This implies that the 
average value of their beliefs must be high. Therefore, workers with 
long tenure are unlikely to quit or separate from their job.

Basic Framework (continued) 
Assume that all training is technologically general in the sense that 
f () is the same in all rms. 
If a worker leaves his original rm, then he will earn v () in the 
outside labor market. 
Suppose 
v () &lt; f (). 
That is, despite that fact that  is general human capital, when the 
worker separates from the rm, he will get a lower wage than his 
marginal product in the current rm. 
The fact that v () &lt; f () implies that there is a surplus that the 
rm and the worker can share when they are together. Also note that 
v () &lt; f () is only possible in labor markets with 
frictions otherwise, the worker would be paid his full marginal 
product, and v () = f ().

The Becker Model: Applications 
There are a range of examples for which this model appears to 
provide a good description. 
These include 
some of the historical apprenticeship programs where young individuals 
worked for very low wages and then graduated to become master 
craftsmen; 
pilots who work for the Navy or the Air Force for low wages, and then 
obtain much higher wages working for private sector airlines; 
securities brokers, often highly qualied individuals with MBA degrees, 
working at a pay level close to the minimum wage until they receive 
their professional certication; 
or even academics taking an assistant professor job at Harvard despite 
the higher salaries in other departments.

Market Failure? 
By investing in his rm-specic skills, the worker is increasing the 
rm s prots. 
Therefore, the rm would like to encourage the worker to invest. 
However, given the timing of the game, wages are determined by a 
take-it-leave-it oer by the rm after the investment. 
Therefore, holdup problem. 
Since rm-specic skills di cult to verify, contractual solutions are 
imperfect.

Investments without Binding Contracts: Underinvestment 
Because of bargaining, the rm is not the full residual claimant of the 
additional returns it generates by its investment. 
Holdup problem; once the rm invests a larger amount in physical 
capital, it is potentially held up by the worker. 
A fraction  all the returns are received by the worker, since the wage 
that the rm has to pay is increasing in its capital stock. 
What would happen if there were binding contracts? 
Sign a contract of the form w (k) before investment . 
This wage schedule would satisfy w0 (k)= 0 and encourage the 
e cient level of investment. 
This wage schedule would avoid the holdup problem.

Now imagine the rm chooses the wage structures such that 
yD (1)  yE (1) &gt; wD  wE &gt; c, (11) 
and then ex post decides whether the worker will be promoted. 
Again by backward induction, we have to look at the decisions in the 
nal period of the game. 
When it comes to the promotion decision, and the worker is unskilled, 
the rm will naturally choose to allocate him to the easy task (his 
productivity is higher in the easy task and his wage is lower). 
If the worker is skilled, and the rm allocates him to the easy task, his 
prots are yE (1)  wE . 
If it allocates him to the di cult task, his prots are yD (1)  wD .

Will Firms Invest in General Training? (continued) 
The answer is no. 
Consider the case with no wage compression, that is the case in which 
a marginal increase in skills is valued appropriately in the outside 
market. 
Mathematically this corresponds to 
v0 ()= f 0() for all . 
Substituting for this in the rst-order condition of the rm, (4), we 
immediately nd that if cf &gt; 0, then c0() = 0. 
So in other words, there will be no rm contribution to training 
expenditures.

The wage structure in (11) ensures that prots from allocating him to 
the di cult task are higher. 
Therefore, with this wage structure the rm has made a credible 
commitment to pay the worker a higher wage if he becomes skilled, 
because it will nd it protable to promote the worker. 
Next, going to the investment stage, the worker realizes that when he 
does not invest he will receive wE , and when he invests, he will get 
the higher wage wD . 
Since, again by (11), wD  wE &gt; c, the worker will nd it protable

With the same argument,workers who have been in a job for a long 
time will have high average  and thus high wages. This implies that 
in equilibrium there will be a tenure premium. 
Moreover, because Bayesian updating immediately implies that the 
gaps between 0 
h() and  and between 0 
l() and  are lowest when 
 is close to 1 (and symmetrically when it is close to 0, but workers 
are never in jobs where their beliefs are close to 0), workers with long 
tenure will not experience large wage changes. In contrast, workers at 
the beginning of their tenure will have higher wage variability.

Wage Determination without Binding Contracts 
In the context of the model here, the Nash bargaining solution 
amounts to choosing the wage, w, so as to maximize: 
(f (k)  w )1 (w  w) . 
The cost of investment, rk, does not feature in this expression, since 
these investment costs are sunk. 
In other words, the prots of the rm are f (k)  w  rk , while its 
outside option is rk. 
So the dierence between payo and outside option for the rm is 
simply f (k)  w. 
Therefore, the wage resulting from the Nash solution will be 
w (k)= f (k)+(1  ) w. 
This expression emphasizes the dependence of the equilibrium wage 
on the capital stock of the rm. 
Contrast this with the equilibrium in a competitive labor market; with 
the ways depend on the capital stock?

Now the subgame perfect equilibrium can be characterized as follows. 
At time t = 1, a worker of training  will receive w1 = y1 + f (). 
Realizing this, at time t = 0, the rm would oer training  = 0, 
irrespective of its contract promise. 
Anticipating this wage oer, the worker will only accept a contract 
oer of the form (0 , w0), such that w0  y0, and  does not matter, 
since the worker knows that the rm is not committed to this promise. 
As a result, we are back to the outcome conjectured by Pigou, with 
no training investment by the rm.

Are the contracts necessary for the Becker solution to work 
reasonable? 
In particular, can the rm make a credible commitment to providing 
training in the amount of  ? 
Such commitments are in general di cult, since outsiders cannot 
observe the exact nature of the training activities taking place 
inside the rm. 
For example, the rm could hire workers at a low wage pretending to 
oer them training, and then employ them as cheap labor. 
This implies that contracts between rms and workers concerning 
training investments are naturally incomplete.

If  = 0, wages will necessarily fall when workers quit (since before

 wage gain when they change jobs, since in this case  &lt; 0 because

Jovanovic assumes that workers always receive their full marginal 
product in each job. 
This is a problematic assumption, since match-specic quality is also 
rm specic, thus there is no reason for the worker to receive this 
entire rm-specic surplus. 
As in the models with rm-specic investments, the more natural 
assumption would be to have some type of wage bargaining. 
Let us assume the simplest bargaining structure in which a rm will 
pay the worker a fraction   (0, 1] of his expected productivity at 
that point. 
In particular, the wage of a worker whose posterior of a good match is 
 will be 
w ()=  [ (pyh +(1  p) yl )+(1  ) (qyh +(1  q) yl )] .

If we knew the experience premium, 1, we could then immediately 
compute the tenure premium 2. 
The problem is that we do not know the experience premium. 
Topel suggests that we can get an upper bound for the experience 
premium by looking at the relationship between entry-level wages and 
labor market experience (that is, wages in jobs with tenure= 0). 
This is an upper bound to the extent that workers do not randomly 
change jobs.

Consider the following two-period model. 
In period 1, the worker and/or the employer choose how much to 
invest in the worker s general human capital, . 
There is no production in the rst period. In period 2, the worker 
either stays with the rm and produces output y = f (), where 
f () is a strictly increasing and concave function. 
The worker is also paid a wage rate, w () as a function of his skill 
level (training) , or he quits and obtains an outside wage. 
The cost of acquiring  units of skill is again c(), which is again 
assumed to be continuous, dierentiable, strictly increasing and 
convex, and to satisfy c0(0) = 0. 
There is no discounting, and all agents are risk-neutral.

Why does wage compression matter for rm-sponsored training? 
Wage compression in the outside market translates into wage 
compression inside the rm, i.e., it implies 
w0 () &lt; f 0(). 
As a result, the rm makes greater prots from a more skilled 
(trained) worker, and has an incentive to increase the skills of the 
worker.

Therefore, the productivity gain of assigning a skilled worker to the 
di cult task is greater than the cost of the worker obtaining skills. 
In this situation, the rm can induce rm-specic investments in skills 
if it can commit to a wage structure attached to promotions. 
In particular, suppose that the rm commits to a wage of wD for the 
di cult task and wE for the easy task. 
Notice that the wages do not depend on whether the worker has 
undertaken the investment, so we are assuming some degree of 
commitment on the side of the rm, but not modifying the crucial 
incompleteness of contracts assumption.

Interpretation 
The empirical investigation of the importance of rm-specic skills 
and rents is a di cult and challenging area. 
There are two important conceptual issues: 
1 We can imagine a world in which rm-specic skills are important, 
but there may be no relationship between tenure and wages. This is 
because productivity increases due to rm-specic skills do not 
necessarily translate into wage increases. 
2 An empirical relationship between tenure and wages does not 
establish that there are imported from-specic eects. This might 
result because of backloaded compensation or because of selection.

Since outside rms do not know worker ability when they make their 
bids, this is a (dynamic) game of incomplete information. 
Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium 
First, note that all workers will leave their current employer if outside 
wages are higher. 
In addition, a fraction  of workers, irrespective of ability, realize that 
they form a bad match with the current employer, and leave whatever 
the wage is. 
The important assumption here is that rms in the outside market 
observe neither worker ability nor whether a worker has quit or has 
been laid o. 
However, worker training is publicly observed.

As usual, equilibrium wage rate w () is independent of c(): 
the level of training is chosen rst, and then the worker and the rm 
bargain over the wage rate; 
at this point the training costs are already sunk, so they do not feature

An alternative arrangement to encourage workers to invest in

Consider the following setup. 
Suppose that there are two investment levels, s = 0, and s = 1 which 
costs c. 
Suppose also that at time t = 1, there are two tasks in the rm, 
di cult and easy, D and E. 
Assume outputs in these two tasks as a function of the skill level are 
yD (0) &lt; yE (0) &lt; yE (1) &lt; yD (1) 
Therefore, skills are more useful in the di cult task, and without skills 
the di cult task is not very productive.

This observation, combined with (6), immediately implies that there 
is wage compression in this world, in the sense that 
pf 0 ()v 0 ()= &lt; f 0 () ,p +(1  p)

There is underinvestment in training relative to the rst-best which 
would have involved pf 0 ()= c0 () (notice that the rst-best 
already takes into account that only a fraction p of the workers will 
benet from training). This is because of two reasons:

2 a fraction  of the high ability workers quit, and the rm does not get 
any prots from them; 
even for the workers who stay, the rm is forced to pay them a higher 
wage, because they have an outside option that improves with their 
training, i.e., v 0 () &gt; 0. This reduces prots from training, since the 
rm has to pay higher wages to keep the trained workers.

To see this, note that a worker who is exogenously separated from his

pf () , 
whereas stayers, who are still subject of the monopsony power of their 
employer, obtain the wage of 
v ()

In the German context, workers who leave their apprenticeship rm to 
serve in the military provide a potential group of such exogenous 
separators. 
Interestingly, the evidence suggests that although these military 
quitters are on average lower ability than those who stay in the 
apprenticeship rm, the military quitters receive higher wages.

Introduction 
Important missing element so far: incomplete contracts 
For a variety of reasons, not all aspects of employment relations are 
regulated by contracts. 
Why are contracts incomplete? 
Two possibilities: 
1 Certain events are not (easily) observable by outside parties, in 
particular by courts. Therefore, writing contracts that are contingent 
on these nonveriable events might be impossible or too costly. 
Critique: implementation schemes can be used for creating 
contingencies on nonveriable events. 
2 There is in multitude of future contingencies, and often even describing 
them is di cult. 
Critiques: implementation schemes can overcome even these di culties. 
Despite these critiques, most contracts in practice seem to be 
incomplete.

Will Firms Invest in General Training? 
The result of no rm-sponsored investment in general training by the 
rm obtains when 
f () = v (), 
which is the case of perfectly competitive labor markets. (4) then 
implies that cf = 0, so when workers receive their full marginal 
product in the outside labor market, the rm will never pay for 
training. 
Moreover, as p  , so that the worker is severely credit 
constrained, there will be no investment in training. 
In all cases, the rm is not constrained, so one dollar of spending on 
training costs one dollar for the rm.

If we relax the symmetry axiom, so that the identities of the players

powers"), then we obtain: 
 1 xNS = arg max (u1 (x)  d1) (u2 (x)  d2) (2)

where   [0, 1] is the bargaining power of player 1. 
Next note that if both utilities are linear and dened over their share

solution to (2) is given by 
(1  ) (x1  d1 )=  (x2  d2) , 
with x1 = 1  x2, which implies the linear sharing rule: 
x2 =(1  ) (1  d1  d2)+ d2.

At time t = 1/2, the rm makes a wage oer w to the worker, and

whether to quit and work for another rm (competitive labor markets: 
suppose that there are many identical rms who can use the general 
skills of the worker, and the worker does not incur any cost in the

Introduction 
A large fraction of earnings growth in the US economy is due to 
growth of wages of workers along their careers. 
Ben-Porath: this is due to continued investment. 
What type of investment during the worker s career? Training. 
But training investments are somewhat dierent from those modeled 
by Ben-Porath, because both the decision to undertake the 
investments and the cost of investments are potentially shared by the 
worker and his current employer. 
First: incomplete contracts.

4 Firm-specic skills can be thought to result mostly from rm-specic 
training investments made by workers and rms. Here it is important 
to distinguish between rmsand workersinvestments, since they will 
have dierent incentives. 
Firm-specic skills simply reect what the worker learns on-the-job 
without making any investments. In other words, they are simply 
unintentional byproducts of working on the job. 
Firm-specic skills may reect matching . 
There may be no technologically rm-specic skills. Instead, all skills 
are technologically general but some are transformed into de facto 
rm-specic skills because of market imperfections (why is this 
dierent from 1?).

Other Problems 
Reduced-form wage equation problematic. 
Alternative: Bertrand competition among rms. 
Clearly the worker will start working for the rm where the prior of a 
good match is greatest. 
Bertrand competition implies that this rm will pay the worker his 
value at the next best job. 
Once the worker receives bad news and decides to quit, then he will 
switch to the job that was previously his next best option. 
But this implies that his wage, which will now be determined by the 
third best option (which may in fact be his initial employer) is 
necessarily smaller, thus job changes will always be associated with 
wage declines. 
Again: learning about general skills and job heterogeneity 
so that workers quit not only because they have received bad news in 
their current job but also because they have learned about their ability 
and can therefore go and work for higher-quality jobs.

Nash Bargaining theorem 
Suppose we impose the following four axioms on the problem and 
solution: 
(1) u1 (x) and u2 (x) are Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions, 
in particular, unique up to positive linear transformations; 
(2) Pareto optimality, the agreement point will be along the frontier; 
(3) Independence of the Relevant Alternatives; suppose X 0 X and 
the choice when bargaining over the set X is x0 X 0, then x0 is also 
the solution when bargaining over X 0; 
(4) Symmetry; identities of the players do not matter, only their 
utility functions. 
Then, there exists a unique bargaining solution that satises these 
four axioms. This unique solution is given by 
xNS = arg max (u1 (x)  d1) (u2 (x)  d2) .

However, as a declines further, we will eventually reach the point 
where w = f . 
Now the rm starts paying for training, and a further decrease in a 
increases investment in general training (from (4)). 
Therefore, there is a U-shaped relation between the skill premium and 
training starting from a compressed wage structure, a further 
decrease in the skill premium may increase training. 
Holding f () constant a tilting up of the wage schedule, w (), 
reduces the prots from more skilled workers, and the rm has less

Simplied version of the model in Acemoglu and Pischke (1998). 
Suppose that fraction p of workers are high ability, and have 
productivity f () in the second period if they receive training  in 
the rst period. 
The remaining 1  p are low ability and produce nothing (in terms of 
the above model, we are setting y = 0). 
No one knows the worker s ability in the rst period, but in the 
second period, the current employer learns this ability. 
Firms never observe the ability of the workers they have not employed, 
so outsiders will have to form beliefs about the worker s ability.

A similar conclusion would also be reached if the rm could write a

constraints and 
c (  ) &gt; y0, 
This implies that the worker cannot take enough of a wage cut to 
nance his training.

outcome, where there is no training investment, despite the fact that 
it is socially optimal to invest in skills

Pre-Becker Thinking (continued) 
No, because there are other rms who have access to exactly the 
same technology, they would be willing to bid a wage of w1 +  for 
this worker s labor services. 
Since there are no costs of changing employer, for  small enough 
such that 
w1 +  &lt; y1 + f () , 
a rm oering w1 +  would both attract the worker by oering this 
higher wage and also make positive prots. 
This reasoning implies that in any competitive labor market: 
w1 = y1 + f () . 
But then, the rm cannot recoup any of its costs and would like to 
choose  = 0. 
Despite the fact that a social planner would choose a positive level of 
training investment,   &gt; 0, the pre-Becker view was that this 
economy would fail to invest in training.

w (), decreasing the relative wages of more skilled workers because 
of bargaining between the rm and in the worker, with the outside 
wage v () as the threat point of the worker. 
Starting from a = 1 and p &lt; , a point at which the worker makes 
all investments, a decrease in a leads to less investment in training 
from (5). 
This is simply an application of the Becker reasoning; without any 
wage compression, the worker is the one receiving all the benets and 
bearing all the costs, and a decline in the returns to training will 
reduce his investments.

By backward induction again, starting in the last period. 
The worker will accept any wage oer w1  y1, since this is what he 
can get in an outside rm. 
Knowing this, the rm simply oers w1 = y1. 
In the previous period, realizing that his wage is independent of his 
specic skills, the worker makes no investment in specic skills.

Is Wage Compression Automatic? 
Let us modify the model so that high ability workers produce 
 + f () 
in the second period, while low ability workers produce f (). 
Training and ability are no longer complements. 
Both types of workers get exactly the same marginal increase in 
productivity (this contrasts with the previous specication where only 
high ability workers beneted from training, hence training and ability 
were highly complementary). Then 
p v ()= + f () ,p +(1  p) 
and hence 
v 0 ()= f 0 () . 
Thus no wage compression, and rm-sponsored training. 
Why?

Wage Compression and Training 
Next consider the case in which there is wage compression, i.e., 
v0 () &lt; f 0(). 
Now it is clear that the rm may be willing to invest in the general 
training of the worker. 
The simplest way to see this is again to consider the case of severe 
credit constraints on the worker, that is, p  , so that the worker 
cannot invest in training. 
Then, v 0(0) &lt; f 0(0) is su cient to induce the rm to invest in 
training.

Training in Imperfect Labor Markets 
The general conclusion of both the Becker model with perfect (credit 
and labor) markets and the model with incomplete contracts (or 
severe credit constraints) is that there will be no rm-sponsored 
investment in general training. 
This conclusion follows from the common assumption of these two 
models, that the labor market is competitive, so the rm will never be 
able to recoup its training expenditures in general skills later during 
the employment relationship. 
Is this a reasonable prediction? 
The answer appears to be no. 
There are many instances in which rms bear a signicant fraction 
(sometimes all) of the costs of general training investments.

Given this setup, the contributions to training expenses cw and cf will 
be determined noncooperatively. 
More specically, the rm chooses cf to maximize prots:

The worker chooses cw to maximize utility:

Mobility, Training and Wages (continued) 
Another implication: multiple equilibria in this economy. 
One equilibrium with a high quit rate, high wages for workers changing 
jobs, i.e. high v (), but low training. 
Another equilibrium with low mobility, low wages for job changers, and 
high training. 
Multiple equilibria as a stylistic description of the dierences between 
the U.S. and German labor markets. 
In Germany, the turnover rate is much lower than in the U.S., and also 
there is much more training. 
Also, in Germany workers who change jobs are much more severely 
penalized (on average, in Germany such workers experience a 
substantial wage loss, while they experience a wage gain in the U.S.).

Worker Power and Investment 
How can we improve the worker s investment incentives? 
General solution: make worker s earnings conditional on specic skills. 
One imperfect but realistic solution: increase the bargaining power of 
the worker. 
For example, the rm may purposefully give access to some important 
assets to the worker 
The rm may change its organizational form in order to make a 
credible commitment not to hold up the worker. 
Alternative: the rm may develop a reputation for not holding up 
workers who have invested in rm-specic human capital.

Minimum Wages and Training (continued) 
Comparative static result: higher minimum wages can increase 
training (as long as  &gt; 0 and su ciently large). 
In the standard Becker model with competitive labor markets, 
minimum wages always reduce training (why?). 
Empirical evidence: mixed, but more of a positive eect.

Investments without Binding Contracts 
A rm and a worker are matched together, and because of labor 
market frictions, they cannot switch partners, so wages are 
determined by bargaining. 
As long as it employs the worker, the total output of the rm is 
f (k) 
where k is the amount of physical capital of the rm. 
Standard assumptions on f : increasing, continuous and strictly 
concave.

The Becker Model (continued) 
To see why no other allocation could be an equilibrium, suppose that 
the rm oered (, w0), such that  6=   . 
For the rm to break even we need that w0  y0  c (), but by the 
denition of  , we have 
y0  c (  )+ y1 + f (  ) &gt; y0  c ()+ y1 + f ()  w0 + y1 + f () 
So the deviation of oering (  , y0  c ( )  ) for  su ciently 
small would attract the worker and make positive prots. 
Thus, the unique equilibrium is the one in which the rm oers 
training   . 
Therefore, in this economy the e cient level of training will be 
achieved with rms bearing none of the cost of training, and workers 
nancing training by taking a wage cut in the rst period of 
employment (i.e, a wage w0 &lt; y0).

Entry Wages in Training Firms 
What happens if equilibrium prots positive, i.e., 
 ()=(1  ) p [f ()  v ()]  c () &gt; 0 
If there is free entry at time t = 0, rms must make zero prots. 
Therefore, competition for workers implies that rst-period wages 
W =  () &gt; 0. 
This is because once a worker accepts a job with a rm, the rm 
acquires monopsony power over this worker s labor services at time 
t = 1 to make positive prots. 
Competition then implies that these prots have to be transferred to 
the worker at time t = 0. 
The interesting result is that not only do rms pay for training, but 
they may also pay workers extra in order to attract them.

Let us now analyze the equilibrium when the worker can invest. 
First note that at t = 1, the worker will be paid w1 = y1 + f (). 
Next recall that   is the e cient level of training given by 
c0 ( )= f 0 ( ). 
In the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, in the rst period the rm 
will oer the following package: training of   and a wage of 
w0 = y0  c (  ) . 
Then, in the second period the worker will receive the wage of 
w1 = y1 + f (  ) 
either from the current rm or from another rm.

Wage Consequences of Separation 
The second type of evidence comes from the wage changes of workers 
resulting from job displacement. 
A number of papers, most notably Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan, 
nd that displaced workers experience substantial drop in earnings. 
They typically ne big drops in wages when workers separate from 
their rms. 
The question is how to interpret this

Equilibrium (continued) 
The rm has monopsony power over the workers, enabling it to 
recover the costs of training. In particular, high ability workers who 
produce f () are paid v () &lt; f (). 
Monopsony power is not enough by itself. Wage compression is also 
essential for this result. To see this, suppose that we impose there is 
no wage compression, i.e., v 0 ()= f 0 (), then inspection of the rst 
line of (7) immediately implies that there will be zero training,  = 0.

But  = 1 would maximize rm-specic skills. 
The reason why the rm would not choose the structure of 
organization that achieves the best investment outcomes is that it 
cares about its own prots, not total income or surplus. 
Also, rms selling the rm to worker unlikely in practice.

          <text>Investment in Specic Training Evidence 
Wage-Tenure Relationship 
The rst type of evidence is from regression analyses of the 
relationship between wages and tenure exploiting within job wage 
growth. 
Here the idea is that by looking at how wages grow within a job (as 
long as the worker does not change jobs), and comparing this to the 
experience premium, we will get an estimate of the tenure premium. 
Imagine the following empirical model 
ln wit = 1Xit + 2Tit + it (9) 
where Xit this total labor market experience of individual i, and Tit is 
his tenure in the current job. 
Alternatively, wage growth within the job is 
 ln wit = 1 + 2 + it .

          <text>Investment in Specic Training Evidence 
Wage-Tenure Relationship (continued) 
Using this procedure Topel estimates relatively high rates of return to 
tenure. 
For example, his main estimates imply that ten years of tenure 
increase wages by about 25 percent, over and above the experience 
premium. 
It is possible, however, that this procedure might generate tenure 
premium estimates that are upward biased. 
For example, this would be the case if the return to tenure or 
experience is higher among high-ability workers, and those are 
underrepresented among the job-changers. 
Alternatively, returns to experience may be non-constant, and they may 
be higher in jobs to which workers are a better match. 
If this is the case, returns experience for new jobs will understate the 
average returns to experience for jobs in which workers choose to stay.

Do Firms Pay for General Training 
Very common in the German apprenticeship system. 
Estimates of the net cost of apprenticeship programs to employers in 
Germany in the 1990s are quite large. 
Another interesting example comes from the recent growth sector of 
the US, the temporary help industry. 
The temporary help rms provide workers to various employers on 
short-term contracts, and receive a fraction of the workerswages as 
commission. 
Most large temporary help rms oer (and pay for) such training to all 
willing individuals 
Management consulting rms hire highly paid MBAs and provide 
largely general training in the rst year. 
Other evidence using regression also consistent, but not as clear-cut 
(because of unobservant originate the problems).

Investments without Binding Contracts: Recap 
Is the assumption of incomplete contracts reasonable? 
There are two reasonsfor why binding contracts are generally not 
possible and instead contracts have to be incomplete : 
1 Such contracts require the level investment, k, to be easily observable 
by outside parties, so that the terms of a contract that makes 
payments conditional on k are easily enforceable (notice the 
important emphasis here; there is no asymmetric information between 
the parties, but outside courts cannot observe what the rm and the 
worker observe; can there be no contracts that transmits this 
information to outside parties in order to make contracts conditional 
on this information?). 
2 We need to rule out renegotiation.

1 
2 Firm-specic training: this provides a worker with rm-specic skills, 
that is, skills that will increase his or her productivity only with the 
current employer. 
General training: this type of training will contribute to the worker s 
general human capital, increasing his productivity with a range of 
employers. 
Naturally, in practice actual training programs could (and often do) 
provide a combination of rm-specic and general skills.

Pre-Becker Thinking: Is There a Mistake? 
The mistake in this reasoning was that it did not take into account 
the worker s incentives to invest in his own training. 
The worker is the full residual claimant of the increase in his own 
productivity, and in the competitive equilibrium of this economy 
without any credit market or contractual frictions, he would have the 
right incentives to invest in his training. 
Therefore, we have to look at worker investments in general training.

Note that if v () is high, many workers leave their employer because 
outside wages in the secondhand market are high. 
But also the right hand side of (8) is increasing in the fraction of 
quitters, 
[1  w ()+ v ()] , 
so v () will increase further. 
This reects the fact that with a higher quit rate, the secondhand 
market is not as adversely selected (it has a better composition).

          <text>Investment in Specic Training Evidence 
Wage Consequences of Separation: Interpretation 
Part of this is due to non-employment following displacement, but 
even after three years a typical displaced worker is earning about 
$1500 less (1987 dollars). 
Econometrically, this evidence is simpler to interpret than the 
tenure-premium estimates. Economically, the interpretation is 
somewhat more di cult than the tenure estimates, since it may 
simply reect the loss of high-rent (e.g. union) jobs. 
Overall, these two pieces of evidence together are consistent with the 
view that there are important rm-specic skills/expertises that are 
accumulated on the job.

Moreover, jobs are experience goods, meaning that workers can 
only nd out whether they are a good match to a job (and to a rm) 
by working in that rm and job. 
Therefore, this type of learning does not take place immediately. 
These ideas captured by learning and matching models a range of 
interesting predictions about labor market mobility and wage patterns.

          <text>General Equilibrium with Imperfect Labor Markets Evidence 
Evidence 
How can this model be tested? 
One way is to look for evidence of this type of adverse selection 
among highly trained workers. 
The fact that employers know more about their current employees 
may be a particularly good assumption for young workers, so a good 
area of application would be for apprentices in Germany. 
According to the model, workers who quit or are laid o should get 
lower wages than those who stay in their jobs, which is a prediction 
that follows simply from adverse selection. 
The more interesting implication here is that if the worker is separated 
from his rm for an exogenous reason that is clearly observable to the 
market, he should not be punished by the secondhand labor market. 
In fact, he s freed from the monopsony power of the rm, and he 
may get even higher wages than stayers (who are on average of higher 
ability, though subject to the monopsony power of their employer).

Josh Angrist 
MIT 14.661 (FALL 2017) 
1 Elasticities 
In the p-comp price-taking world, market-level supply and demand elasticities 
drive comparative statics. 
Suppose theres ther es one type of labor; demand for it is D(w), with deriva -
tive D0(w) and that homogeneous labor is supplied by natives according to 
S1(w). 
 The elasticity  of  demand is 
dLw D0(w)w  = = &lt; 0  dwL L 

 We similarly de ne the elasticity of (native) labor supply 
S10 (L)w " = &gt; 0  L 
Recall that these  describe movements along supply and demand curves. 
2 Market structure 
Johnson (1980) assumes that wages and employment of low-skill natives are 
determined by equilibrium in a perfectly competitive factor market. 
 n1 identical (low-skilled) natives supply this much labor: 
L1  S1(w)=n1h(w), (1) 
where h(w)is per-capita hours worked (normalized to vary from 0 to 1) 
 Firms demand D(w)low-skill  workers 
 Without immigration , equilibrium wages (w)a n d e m p l o y m e n t (L)i n 1
the low-skill labor market satisfy: 
L =n1h(w )=D(w )1

Separating Equilibrium (continued) 
If a low ability worker deviates to obtaining education, the market will 
perceive him as a high ability worker, and pay him the higher wage 
w (e = 1)= yH . But from (7), we have that 
yH  cL &lt; yL. 
Therefore, we have indeed an equilibrium. 
In this equilibrium, education is valued simply because it is a signal 
about ability.

Baseline Signaling Model 
Consider the following simple model to illustrate the issues. 
There are two types of workers, high ability and low ability. 
The fraction of high ability workers in the population is . 
Workers know their own ability, but employers do not observe this 
directly. They only observe schooling. 
High ability workers always produce yH , low ability workers produce 
yL. (No productive role of schooling for simplicity now).

          <text>Labor Market Externalities Econometric Issues and Evidence 
Interpretation (continued) 
Second problem: even if we have an instrument for average 
schooling in the aggregate, estimates of labor market externalities 
might be spurious. 
In particular, if individual schooling is measured with error (or for 
some other reason OLS returns to individual schooling are not the 
causal eect), some of this discrepancy between the OLS returns and 
the causal return may load on average schooling, even when average 
schooling is instrumented. 
This suggests that we may need to instrument for individual schooling 
as well (so as to get to the correct return to individual schooling).

          <text>Labor Market Externalities Pecuniary Externalities 
Pecuniary Externalities (continued) 
For now the important thing is that human capital externalities arise 
here because rms choose their physical capital in anticipation of the 
average human capital of the workers they will employ in the future. 
Since physical and human capital are complements in this setup, a 
more educated labor force encourages greater investment in physical 
capital and to higher wages. 
In the absence of the need for search and matching, rms would 
immediately hire workers with skills appropriate to their investments, 
and there would be no human capital externalities. 
Nonpecuniary and pecuniary theories of human capital externalities 
lead to similar empirical relationships since equation (6) is identical to 
equation (2), with c = ln B and  = / (1  ). 
Again presuming that these interactions exist in local labor markets, 
we can estimate a version of (2) using dierences in schooling across 
labor markets (cities, states, or even countries).

, indicating substantial positive human capital externalities; e.g., Jim 
Rauch s paper in the Journal of Urban Economics 1993.

Pooling Equilibrium (continued) 
The reason why this renement is called The Intuitive Criterion is 
that it can be supported by a relatively intuitive speech by the 
deviator along the following lines: 
you have to deduce that I must be the high type deviating to 
e = 1, since low types would never ever consider such a 
deviation, whereas I would nd it protable if I could convince 
you that I am indeed the high type). Of course, this is only very 
loose, since such speeches are not part of the game, but it gives 
the basic idea. 
The overall conclusion: separating equilibria, where education is a 
valuable signal, may be more likely than pooling equilibria. 
When would this not be the case?

Back to Negative Externalities (continued) 
Now returning to regression models, in a world where signaling or 
ranking is important, we might also want to estimate an equation of 
the form (2), but when signaling issues are important, we would 
expect  to be negative. 
When others invest more in their education, a given individual s rank 
in the distribution declines, hence others are creating a negative 
externality on this individual via their human capital investment.

A Feasible Strategy? 
Quarter of birth instruments might come close to this. 
Since quarter of birth instruments are likely to aect the same people 
as compulsory schooling laws, adjusting with the quarter of birth 
estimate, or using quarter of birth dummies as instrument for 
individual schooling, is the right strategy. 
So the strategy is to estimate an equation similar to (2) or (13) using 
compulsory schooling laws for average schooling and quarter of birth 
dummies for individual schooling.

Separating Equilibrium 
Suppose that we have 
yH  cH &gt; yL &gt; yH  cL (7) 
This is clearly possible since cH &lt; cL. 
Then the following is an equilibrium: all high ability workers obtain 
education, and all low ability workers choose no education. 
Wages (conditional on education) are: 
w (e = 1)= yH and w (e = 0)= yL 
Notice that these wages are conditioned on education, and not 
directly on ability , since ability is not observed by employers.

Pooling Equilibrium (continued) 
Take the pooling equilibrium above. Consider a deviation to e = 1. 
There is no circumstance under which the low type would benet 
from this deviation, since 
yL &gt; yH  cL, 
and the low ability worker is now getting 
(1  ) yL + yH . 
Therefore, rms can deduce that the deviation to e = 1 must be 
coming from the high type, and oer him a wage of yH . 
Then (8) ensures that this deviation is protable for the high types, 
breaking the pooling equilibrium.

Consider now signaling. Take the most extreme world in which 
education is only a signal it does not have any productive role. 
What happens if all of the other workers in my labor market become 
more educated? 
Perhaps the same thing as ranking?

A Little Bit of Econometrics 
To elaborate on the second problem, let Yijt be the log weekly wage, 
than the estimating equation is 
Yijt = Xi 0  + j + t + 1Sjt + 2i si + ujt + i , (10) 
To illustrate the main issues, ignore time dependence, and consider 
the population regression of Yijt on si : 
Yijt = 0 + j + t + 0si + 0it ; where E[0it si ]  0. (11) 
Next consider the IV population regression using a full set of state 
dummies. This is equivalent to 
Yijt = 1 + j + t + 1Sj + 1it ; where E[1it Sj ]  0, (12) 
since the projection of individual schooling on a set of state dummies 
is simply average schooling in each state.

An Aside on Pecuniary Externalities 
Here is a slightly more formal discussion. Consider an exchange 
economy with N + 1 agents with quasi-linear utility given by 
yi + ui (xi ), 
where yi is money and xi is the focal good. The price of this good is 
determined from market clearing: 
N 
 xi = 0, 
i =0 
since this is an exchange economy (some agents are sellers and some 
are buyers). Market clearing determines the price as 
p = p(x0, . . . , xN ). 
Suppose all of these functions are dierentiable.

Generalizations (continued) 
Why are high types are happy to do this? From the single-crossing 
property: 
yH (eh )  cH (eh )= yH (eh )  cL (eh )  (cH (eh )  cL (eh )) 
  &gt; yH (eh )  cL (eh )  (cH (el )  cL (el )) 
    = yL (el )  cL (el )  (cH (el )  cL (el )) 
 = yL (el )  cH (el ) , 
High ability workers investing in schooling more than they would have 
done in the perfect information case, in the sense that eh 
characterized here is greater than the education level that high ability 
individuals chosen with perfect information, given by 
0  0  yH (eh )= cH (eh ).

Nonpecuniary Positive Externalities (continued) 
Instead, more compelling (at least from one perspective) sources of 
spillovers: 
Interactions in the labor market mediated by prices, but externalities 
might still be at present; pecuniary externalities. 
Interactions in the product market; when computer users become more 
productive, they can supply cheaper computers to retail companies, 
again pecuniary externalities. 
Interactions via R&amp;D and innovation; the semiconductor or the 
combustion engine have increased the productivity of many workers in 
many dierent sectors of the economy. 
The last one may or may not be a pecuniary externality. 
However, except those working in the labor market, the remaining 
externalities would be economy-wide (sometimes even world-wide), 
thus di cult to estimate with cross-sectional or panel data variation. 
Thus, let us focus on labor market interactions.

The separating equilibrium is not the only one. 
Consider the following allocation: both low and high ability workers 
do not obtain education, and the wage structure is 
w (e = 1)=(1  ) yL + yH and w (e = 0)=(1  ) yL + yH 
(Does this wage structure make sense?) 
Again no incentive to deviate by either workers or rms. 
Is this Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium reasonable?

Now suppose that we change the behavior of agent 0 and consider 
the welfare impact of this on all agents. 
This is given by: 
N dui (xi |p) pU =  
i =0 dp x0 
where ui (xi |p) is the reduced-form utility function of agent i 
(meaning that after we substitute in the budget constraint). 
We also have 
dui (xi |p) ui (xi |p) ui (xi |p) dxi = +dp p xi dp 
First suppose that all agents are optimizing. Then the second term in 
this expression is equal to zero because ui (xi |p)= 0 by the envelope xi theorem, and the rst term is equal to 
ui (xi |p) = xi . p

Individual earnings can then be written as

Taking logs: 
ln Wi = ln B +  ln H +  ln hi . (2) 
If external eects are stronger within a geographical area, as seems 
likely in a world where human interaction and the exchange of ideas 
are the main forces behind the externalities, then equation (2) should 
be estimated using measures of H at the local level. 
This is a theory of non-pecuniary externalities, since the external 
returns arise from the technological nature of equation (1). 
Nonpecuniary externalities unattractive for a number of reasons: 
Very reduced form.

Pooling Equilibrium (continued) 
Simplest renement: Intuitive Criterion by Cho and Kreps. 
The underlying idea: if there exists a type who will never benet from 
taking a particular deviation, then the uninformed parties (here the 
rms) should deduce that this deviation is very unlikely to come from 
this type. 
This falls within the category of forward induction where rather 
than solving the game simply backwards, we think about what type of 
inferences will others derive from a deviation.

Now the equilibrium is straightforward to characterize. 
Substituting (5) into (3), and using the fact that wages are equal to a 
fraction  of output, the wage income of individual i is given by 
/(1) R/(1)(hi )Wi =  ((1  )H) . 
Taking logs, this is: 
ln Wi = c + ln H +  ln hi , (6)1   
where c is a constant and / (1  ) and  are positive coe cients. 
The presence of ln H on the right hand side corresponds to positive 
pecuniary externalities (in the local labor market). 
What about education choices? This actually is a trickier issue and I 
will return to it later.

Baseline Signaling Model (continued) 
Workers can invest in education, e {0, 1}. 
The cost of obtaining education is cH for high ability workers and cL 
for low ability workers. 
Crucial assumption (single crossing ) 
cL &gt; cH 
That is, education is more costly for low ability workers. This is often 
referred to as the single-crossing assumption, since it makes sure 
that in the space of education and wages, the indierence curves of 
high and low types intersect only once. For future reference, I denote 
the decision to obtain education by e = 1. 
To start with, suppose that education does not increase the 
productivity of either type of worker. 
Once workers obtain their education, there is competition among a 
large number of risk-neutral rms, so workers will be paid their 
expected productivity .

A Search Model of Pecuniary Externalities 
Consider an economy lasting two periods, with production only in the 
second period, and a continuum of workers normalized to 1. 
Take human capital of each worker i, hi , as given. 
A continuum of risk-neutral rms. 
In period 1, rms make an irreversible investment decision, k, at cost 
Rk. 
Workers and rms come together in the second period. 
The labor market is not competitive; instead, rms and workers are 
matched randomly, and each rm meets a worker. 
The only decision workers and rms make after matching is whether 
to produce together or not to produce at all (since there are no 
further periods).

The answer is no. 
This equilibrium is being supported by the belief that the worker who 
gets education is no better than a worker who doesn t. 
But education is more costly for low ability workers, so they should be 
less likely to deviate to obtaining education. 
This can be ruled out by various dierent renements of equilibria.

Not necessarily. 
If all of the spillover is within the rm, the rm will internalize it in its 
hiring decisions and in its compensation of dierent workers with 
dierent amounts of human capital. 
In that case, there is a technological spillover, but no labor market 
externality. 
Externalities require 
either that productivity spillovers are beyond rm boundaries 
or that rms are unable to compensate workers appropriately for their

case?)

          <text>Labor Market Externalities Pecuniary Externalities 
Pecuniary Positive Externalities 
First suggested in Alfred Marshall s Principles of Economics in the 
context of benets of geographic concentration of industry. 
A complementary story with labor market imperfections, innovation 
investment by rms and training by workers developed in Acemoglu 
(1997). 
Firms nd it protable to invest in new technologies only when there is 
a su cient supply of trained workers to replace employees who quit. 
This is a pecuniary externality, since it is not built in in the form of 
technological spillovers, but works through market interactions and 
results from the fact that prices at which labor is transacted is not 
equal to its marginal product. 
A related model developed in Acemoglu (1996). Here is simplied 
version of this model.

Interpretation 
There are at least two problems with this type OLS estimates. 
First problem: high-wage cities or states may attract a large number 
of high education workers or give strong support to education. 
Rauch uses a cross-section of cities. 
Including city or state xed aects ameliorates this problem, but does 
not solve it, since statesattitudes towards education and the demand 
for labor may comove. The ideal approach would be to nd a source of 
quasi-exogenous variation in average schooling across labor markets. 
Acemoglu and Angrist (2000): exploit exogenous sources of variation 
due to cross-state dierences in compulsory schooling laws. The 
advantage is that these laws not only aect individual schooling but 
average schooling in a given area.

Then we can write the incentive compatibility constraint for the low 
type, such that when the market expects low types to obtain 
education el , the low type does not try to mimic the high type. 
  yL (el )  cL (el )  w (e)  cL (e) for all e, (9) 
Let eh be the level of education for high type such that this constraint 
holds as an equality: 
  yL (el )  cL (el )= yH (eh )  cL (eh ) . 
Question: why did we write w (eh )= yH (eh )? 
Then the Riley equilibrium is such that low types choose el and 
obtain the wage 
 w (el )= yL (el ) , 
and high types choose eh and obtain the wage 
w (eh )= yH (eh ) .

Ranking and Negative Externalities 
The above models focused on positive externalities to education. 
In contrast, in a world where education plays a ranking role, we 
might also expect negative externalities . 
Suppose that there are dierent types of jobs with dierent 
quality/attributes and higher-quality jobs pay higher wages (this may 
be due to bargaining reasons). 
Suppose also that higher education workers get the higher quality jobs 
(a sort of assignment rule). 
What will happen if all of the other workers in my labor market 
become more educated?

Third approach: Tyler, Murnane and Willett. 
Passing grades in the Graduate Equivalent Degree (GED) dier by 
state. 
So an individual with the same grade in the GED exam will get a 
GED in one state, but not in another. 
If the score in the exam is an unbiased measure of human capital, and 
there is no signaling, these two individuals should get the same wages. 
If the GED is a signal, and employers do not know where the 
individual took the GED exam, these two individuals should get 
dierent wages. 
Using this methodology, the authors estimate that there is a 10-19 
percent return to a GED signal.

What Can Be Done? 
Instrument for both individual and average schooling, we would solve 
this problem. 
But what type of instrument? 
Consider the relationship of interest, and for simplicity ignore the time 
dimension: 
Yij =  + 1Sj + 2isi + uj + i , (15) 
which could be estimated by OLS or instrumental variables, to obtain 
an estimate of 1 as well as an average estimate of 2i , say 2 .
An alternative way of expressing this relationship is to adjust for the 
eect of individual schooling by directly rewriting (15): 
e Yij  2 si  Yij (16) 
=  + 1Sj + [uj + i + (2i  2  )si ].

Now consider the estimation of the empirical analogue of equation 
(2): 
Yijt =  + j + t + 0si + 1Sj + it ; where E[it si ] = E[it Sj ]  0.
(13) 
Then, we have 
0 = 1 + (0  1 ) (14) 
1 = (1  0)
where 
 = 1/(1  R2) &gt; 1,
and R2 is the rst-stage R-squared for the 2SLS estimates in (12). 
Therefore, when 1 &gt; 0, for example because there is measurement
error in individual schooling, we may nd positive external returns 
even when there are none.

Equilibrium Responses in Signaling Models 
The second approach was pioneered by Lang and Kropp (1986), who 
observed that in the presence of signaling, binding compulsory 
schooling laws should increase the education investments of those not 
directly aected as an equilibrium response to the behavior of others 
whose education is being increased by the laws because they want to 
signal themselves apart. 
E.g., you could send a signal distinguishing yourself from certain
workers by graduating from high school, but now everybody is forced to
graduate from high school, so you have to go to college.
A related idea is tested in Bedard (2001): the introduction of access 
to university should lead to an increase in high school dropout rate. 
Why? 
Bedard tests this by comparing high school dropout rates in labor 
markets with and without two-year or four-year colleges

Back to Negative Externalities 
Now suppose there is signaling, and suppose there are no direct 
productivity benets from education. 
Contrast two situations: in the rst, all individuals have 12 years of 
schooling and in the second all individuals have 16 years of schooling. 
Since education has no productive role, and all individuals have the 
same level of schooling, in both allocations they will earn exactly the 
same wage (equal to average productivity). 
Therefore, here the increase in aggregate schooling does not translate 
into aggregate increases in wages. 
But in the same world, if one individual obtains more education than 
the rest, there will be a private return to him, because he would signal 
that he is of higher ability. 
Is this a pecuniary or a nonpecuniary externality?

          <text>Labor Market Externalities Econometric Issues and Evidence 
Interpretation (continued) 
This shows that to obtain consistent estimates of external returns to 
schooling we should set 
E[2i si |zi = 1]  E[2isi |zi = 0]  = (17)2 E[si |zi = 1]  E[si |zi = 0]
E[(Yij  1Sj )|zi = 1]  E[(Yij  1Sj )|zi = 0]= E[si |zi = 1]  E[si |zi = 0]
This is typically not the OLS estimator of the private return, and we 
should be using some instrument to simultaneously estimate the 
private return to schooling. The ideal instrument would be one 
aecting exactly the same people as the compulsory schooling laws.

Nonpecuniary Positive Externalities 
A simple model of nonpecuniary externalities: 
Suppose that the output (or marginal product) of a worker, i, is 
yi = Ahi  , 
where hi is the human capital (schooling) of the worker, and A is 
aggregate productivity. 
Assume that labor markets are competitive. So individual earnings are 
Wi = Ahi  . 
Key idea: the exchange of ideas among workers raises productivity. 
This can be modeled by allowing A to depend on aggregate human 
capital. In particular, suppose that 
A = BH  E [hi ], (1) 
where H is a measure of aggregate human capital, E is the 
expectation operator, B is a constant, and  &gt; 0 (the case where &lt; 0 
would have negative externalities).

Discussion 
The estimation results from using this strategy in Acemoglu and 
Angrist (2000) suggest that there are no signicant external returns. 
The estimates are typically around 1 percent or less, and statistically 
not dierent from zero. 
They also suggest that in the aggregate signaling considerations are 
unlikely to be very important (at the very least, they do not dominate 
positive externalities). 
But caveat : the fweaker signicantly weaker is a full set of state times 
linear trends are included.

Introduction 
General interest over the recent two decades or so on the modeling 
and estimation of various aspects of labor market externalities. 
Two dierent aspects of externalities: 
Externalities in (local) labor markets due to production, matching or 
other market interactions. 
Externalities in social environments, including schools, friendships, 
1 
2 
neighborhoods, and networks as well as their implications for social 
mobility, inequality 
Both types of externalities may be important in practice and have 
major welfare consequences. 
Both types of externalities present a range of challenges in estimation. 
These two lectures on labor market externalities, and then we will 
turn to social mobility and peer eects.

where  &lt; 1,   1  . 
Since it is costly for the worker-rm pair to separate and nd new 
partners in this economy, employment relationships generate 
quasi-rents. 
Wages will therefore be determined by rent-sharing. Here, simply 
assume that the worker receives a share  of this output as a result of 
bargaining, while the rm receives the remaining 1   share (a 
simplied version of Nash bargaining). 
An equilibrium in this economy is a set of schooling choices for 
workers and a set of physical capital investments for rms.

Separating Equilibrium (continued) 
Let us now check that all parties are playing best responses. 
Given the strategies of workers, a worker with education has 
productivity yH while a worker with no education has productivity yL. 
So no rm can change its behavior and increase its prots. 
What about workers? 
If a high ability worker deviates to no education, he will obtain 
w (e = 0)= yL, but 
w (e = 1)  cH = yH  cH &gt; yL.

Direct Signals (continued) 
An interesting result we can see from the above table is that there are 
no GED returns to minorities. 
This is also consistent with the signaling view, since it turns out that 
many minorities prepare for and take the GED exam in prison. 
Therefore, GED would be not only a positive signal, but also likely a 
signal that the individual was at some point incarcerated. Hence not 
a good signal at all.

Suppose education is continuous e  [0, ).

The single crossing property is that

that is, the marginal cost of investing in a given unit of education is

Labor Market Externalities 
What happens to my wages/earnings if other workers in the same 
labor market/economy increase their schooling by one year? 
The Becker-Mincer-Ben Porath framework silent on this (it answers 
the question of how much my earnings increased when I increase my 
schooling by one year). 
Useful to distinguish between non-pecuniary externalities (where the 
eect of otherseducation on me as technological ) vs. pecuniary 
externalities (where the eect of otherseducation on me works 
through changes in equilibrium prices).

          <text>Shapiro-Stiglitz Evidence on E ciency Wages 
Evidence on E ciency Wages 
Two types of evidence oered in the literature in support of e ciency 
wages. 
First: presence of substantial inter-industry wage dierences (e.g., 
Krueger and Summers, 1989). 
Such wage dierentials are consistent with e ciency wage theories 
since the monitoring problem (q in terms of the model above) is 
naturally more serious in some industries than others. But they are also 
consistent with lots of other models. 
Moreover, the exact extent of true inter-industry wage dierentials is 
quite debatable (e.g., Abowd, Kramartz and Margolis, 1999). 
For example, these dierentials may reect compensating wages (since 
some jobs may be less pleasant than others) or premia for unobserved 
characteristics of workers, which dier systematically across industries 
because workers select into industries based on their abilities. 
Even if there were such dierentials across rms industries, this could 
be rent-sharing (e.g., Van Reenen, 1996, Hildreth and Oswald, 1997).

Non-Steady-State Dynamics (continued) 
Could there be non-steady-state dynamics coming from the 
non-shirking condition? 
Not really. With the argument given above, we have VN = VS at all E E 
points in time, and thus 
VEN = VES . 
But this implies that even without imposing steady state, the exact 
same non-shirking condition is obtained. 
Intuitively, the non-shirking condition has to hold at all points in time 
this, which removes the possibility of higher wages in the future 
incentivizing workers. (Or vice versa). 
But note a very important assumption here: no wage discrimination 
across workers. What would happen if rms could oer (and commit 
to) dierent wages for dierent workers, and in particular as a 
function of their tenure in the rm?

Environment 
Model in continuous time and all agents are risk neutral and innitely 
lived. 
Workers have to choose between two levels of eort, and are only 
productive if they exert eort. 
eort 0 ~cost = 0, not productive 
1 ~cost = e, productive 
Without any informational problems rms would write contracts to 
pay workers only if they exert eort. 
The problem arises because rms cannot observe whether a worker 
has exerted eort or not, and cannot deduce it from output, since 
output is a function of all workerseorts. 
This introduces the moral hazard problem. 
In addition, workers cannot be punished for low output. 
This introduces the limited liability problem.

Dynamic Programming Equations (continued) 
Let us rst focus on steady state. 
Suppose that a shirking worker always shirks and worker who exerts 
eort always does so also (is this necessary?). Then we can write (2) 
as w  e + bVUVN = ,E r + b 
and (1) as 
w + (b + q)VUrV S = .Er + b + q 
Combining those, we can reexpress (4) as 
e w  rVU + e +(r + b) [non-shirking condition]. q 
Intuitively, the greater is the unemployment benet and the greater is 
the cost of eort, the greater should the wage be. 
More importantly, the more likely the worker is to be caught when he 
shirks, the lower is the wage.

Equilibrium (continued) 
Non-shirking conditionlabor supply (why?) 
For equilibrium, we also need to consider labor demand. 
Suppose that the aggregate demand for labor is given from the 
production side represented by the aggregate production function 
AF (L). 
Let us make the standard assumptions on F , in particular, it is 
increasing and strictly concave, i.e. F 00 &lt; 0. 
No adjustment costs are dynamics, so rms maximize static prots. 
Therefore, aggregate labor demand is given by 
AF 0 (L)= w.

Environment (continued) 
Continuous timeow rates instead of probabilities. 
If a worker shirks , there is eort = 0, then there is a ow rate q of 
getting detected and red. 
What does this mean mathematically? 
Formally, this corresponds to a Poisson process in continuous time, 
meaning that in the interval of length t, the probability of a shirking 
worker being caught is q  t + o(t), where o(t) designates terms 
o(t)that are second-order in t, i.e., limt0 t = 0. 
What does it mean economically? 
Suppose that the worker s actions aect the probability distribution of 
some observable signal on the basis of which the rm compensates him 
or besides to re him.

Why Not Pareto Improvements? 
A subsidy on wages nanced by a tax on prots will increase output. 
But this is not a Pareto improvement. 
Who owns the rms? 
If rms are owned by capitalists, the above policy will increase output, 
but will not constitute a Pareto improvement. 
If rms are owned by workers, the above policy will constitute a 
Pareto improvement. 
But in this case workers have enough income. 
Why do they not already enter into bonding contracts or at least 
write better contracts as in our moral hazard models?

Since there is unemployment, rents and information problems here, it 
is also natural to ask the welfare question: is the level of 
unemployment too high? 
Answer: depends on what notion of welfare we are using and whether 
rms are owned by nonworkers. 
Incorrect answer: the equilibrium is Pareto suboptimal. 
Why is this incorrect?

What is the problem with backloading? 
Perhaps rm-side moral hazard rms may claim workers have shirked 
and re them either to reduce labor costs when the worker s wage has

1 Second: look for direct evidence for e ciency wage considerations. 
Krueger (1991) compares wages and tenure premia in franchised and 
company-owned fast food restaurants. Idea: less monitoring of 
workers in a company-owned restaurant. Why? He nds higher wages 
and steeper tenure-which proles in company-owned restaurants. 
2 Cappelli and Chauvin (1991): look at the number of disciplinary 
dismissals, as a measure of shirking, in the dierent plants located in 
dierent areas, but all by the same automobile manufacturer (and 
covered by the same union). The rm pays the same nominal wage 
everywhere (because of union legislation), which translates into 
greater wage premia in some areas because outside wages dier. 
Result: when wage premia are greater, there are fewer disciplinary 
dismissals. Is this su cient evidence? 
3 Bewley (1999) and Campbell and Kamlani (1997) present survey 
evidence. Firms often unwilling to cut wages because this will reduce 
worker eort and increase shirking. Alternative explanations?

at the ow rate b, he separates from the rm exogenously, and at the

unemployed, receiving VU and losing VES . In continuous time, the

Non-Steady-State Dynamics 
Are there interesting non-steady-state dynamics? 
In search models, which are also characterized by a ow in = ow 
out type equation, there will be dynamics. 
So let s rst think about this equation. Instead of steady state, if we 
look at it more generally, we can write it as 
U= workers losing their jobs  hires. 
Could there be slow dynamics coming from this equation? 
Suppose that unemployment is above its equilibrium value, U , 
determined previously. What would happen? 
Answer: there will immediately be a huge increase in hires until 
unemployment reaches immediately U . Why?

Equilibrium: Interpretation 
Higher unemployment makes losing the job more costly, hence 
encourages workers not to shirk. 
Source of the idea that unemployment is a worker discipline device 
(what happens if unemployment is equal to 0?) 
Now in this light, let us revisit the implicit assumption that a rm 
always res a worker who is caught shirking. What happens if the 
rm does not re but pays a lower wage to such a worker? What 
happens if the rm res such a worker only with some probability, ?

Steady state requires that = 
ow into unemployment = ow out of unemployment 
In equilibrium, no one shirks because the non-shirking condition holds 
(similar to the agents doing the right thing in the agency models). 
Therefore, 
bL = aU 
where L is employment, and U unemployment. 
This implies
