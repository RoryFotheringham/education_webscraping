          <text>Ways to Impact Energy Use: Technology
1.Shift the vehicle performance/fuel economy tradeoff towards 
l
ower fuel consumption
2.Improve vehicle maintenance, lubricants, tire pressure, r
educe parasitic loads
3.Lighter weight, l ess big vehicles
4.Implement more efficient engine, drivetrain, and vehicle tec
hnologies
5.Develop and implement use of hydrogen as an energy c
arrier with fuel cell powered vehicles
6.Use electricity with advanced battery technologies to shift par
t of transportation energy demand away from petroleum

A.Numbers matter, at least they should:
Massachusetts Avenue carries as many people 
i
n peak buses as in autos
Speed is important for longer trips, but 20 mph i
sn't so different than 50 mph as a top speed; 
when you look at travel time, avoiding 5 mph is  the big issue.
Pedestrians are often very important, but i
gnored.
Bicycles are tiny, get a lot of attention, and c
omplicate traffic a lot, but need safer 
conditions

          <text>Can We Be Realistic AND Positive?
Currently 750 million vehicles in world.  By 2050, number 
i
s projected to be 2 billion.  [Factor of 3]
Is it feasible to reduce petroleum consumption per v
ehicle by a factor of 4?  Could we really change?
Maybe.  If we can implement a 20% fuel consumption r
eduction in each of 6 different areas:
0.86 = 0.26
Will require changes in technology, vehicles, system oper
ation, and behavior.  Technology is key, but not 
enough.

Urban Transportation Planning 181.Decide who you are, and what 
your relationship is to the other actors
2.Scan the environment, review history, identify trends, project future conditions
3.Identify relevant actors, primary roles and interests and culture
4.Define your communication mechanism(s)
5.Define problem(s)
6.Identify opportunities
7.Develop solution(s)
8.Consider implementation
9.Consider operation and maintenance of facilities, services
10.Who are the apparent decision 
makers?
11.Predict outcomes, benefits, 
costs, impacts (4 -step model)
12.Consider finance
13.Evaluate alternatives
14.Develop vision
15.Choose course of action
16.Build constituency, consolidate 
allies, attempt to convert opponents
