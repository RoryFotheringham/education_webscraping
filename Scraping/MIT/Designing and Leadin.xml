          <text>Candidate 2
He is a trustworthy consensus-builder and has a low-
stress demeanor. He is very smart, thoughtful, and 
careful, but does not exhibit the forceful demeanor of 
someone who will get up and rouse the troops. He has 
a very good understanding of the product, but doesnt 
have much experience in marketing shrink-wrapped software.

Describing someone he respects 
Andy Marcuvitz is a heavyset guy who wears badly 
fitting suits. He has no discernible personality, sense of 
humor, or compassion  ideal traits for a venture 
capitalist. During eighteen months of extremely intense 
interaction, we never had a personal conversation, I 
never heard him make a joke, and he rarely smiled In 
arguments, and we had many, hes relentless; his voice 
remains even, he never loses his temper, and he can dig 
in for hours And yet, he was good for me, and in a 
slightly twisted way, I respect him a great deal. (p.69)</text>

?	Candidate 1: VP of marketing of a r eputable west coast database  company, in 
his late 30s, he has strong marketin g skills, and relevant experience in 
client/server technology. In  his current position, he manages 25 people. Prior to 
joining the datab ase company in its st artup phase, he was the proprietor of a 
small advertising business. 
?	Candidate 2: VP of systems management prod ucts with a large east coast-
based software company, in his early 30s, he has the reputation for being 
extraordinary team build er and earning the loyalty of emp loyees at al l levels. In 
his current position as the manager of a business unit, he has increased revenue 
from $1 million to $50 million in 30 mont hs. Hes been the vice president of 
engineering for the comp anys subsidiar y. Yet he has li mited experience in sales 
and mark eting. 
?	Candidate 3: President for five years of an  east coast based software 
company, in his early 40 s, he took the company fr om startup to IPO. The 
company produces a high-e nd graphic user interface, programming languag e, 
and client/server tools. It sells directly to customers, of ten entering into long-
term relationships with them. The IPO led to a management c hange and, as a 
result, he hasnt been ac tive in software for appr oximately a year. He is 
interested in reentering the industry.</text>

          <text>Candidate 1
He projects tremendous enthusiasm about Vermeers 
future and has offered numerous ideas about leveraging 
the companys lead in the marketplace through strategic 
partnerships. The VCs have really liked him as a 
magnetic, gregarious, smart, and down to earth person. 
But Randy is afraid this person may be a little too 
slick[T]he candidate doesnt possess a deep 
understanding of the technology. I am somewhat 
concerned that he has never held profit and loss 
responsibility in the past. Also, he doesnt seem terribly 
enthusiastic about relocating from the west coast.

On Entrepreneurship 
Starting a company, raising money, and making 
deals was a constant battle against sharks and 
suits  s ome of the ruthless and dishonest, 
others equally dangerous because they were simply incompetent 
its not a place where the good guys, or the best ideas, always win, and one finds little 
evidence that the meek shall inherit the earth. A 
wide array of powerful incumbents, ruthless people, and old-boy networks make life difficult.</text>

          <slideno>8</slideno>
          <text>Candidate 3
He has a strong, polished style. References are 
universally of the opinion that he is someone who can do 
the job, and he has the track record to prove it. In his previous organization, he had created a flat structure, 
and encouraged purposeful competition among 
subordinates. However, some of his ex-employees feel 
that he was a bit aloof with others, which led to lack of clarity in the organization about management agenda. 
He has an extensive marketing background, but not in shrink-wrapped software. Although he has a fairly good 
knowledge about Vermeer and its product, some of us 
are concerned about the depth of his technical ability.

?	By 1997, Rodgers had done away with the killer 
software and made use of the goals system 
voluntary (~1/2 Cypress managers use it). 
?	Rodgers acknowledged that HR had a critical 
role to play and hired seasoned professionals to 
help enhance individual development. 
?	In September, Cypress stock reached 24, a 
fourfold increase since April.</text>

James K. Sims, who built the busine ss to more than $ 600 million in 
annual sales but was ousted after failing to manage the c ompany's 
explosive growth. Without strong systems in place, the company 
floundered. Internal spats pitted division against division, earnings 
suffered, and the company failed to sh ift its focus to the booming Web, 
say a dozen former and current em ployees. (Boston Globe, May 31,

          <text>Groups That Work 
. . . those who create and lead work groups 
might most appropriately focus their efforts on 
the creation of conditions that support effective 
team performance. Rather than attempting to 
manage group behavior in real time, leaders 
might better spend their energies creating 
contexts that increase the likelihood . . . that 
teams will prosper . . .

          <text>Mounting Tensions

--who had previously worked as a line manager in the 
fashion industry -- was unqualified for the job.</text>

          <text>The Star Model
Attachment to challenging work
Select stars, usually from elite sources
Professional control
We recruit only top talent, pay them top wages, and give them
the resources and autonomy they need to do their job. 
Scientists like autonomy and independence. I value it myself
and its important to make sure that they have that. They feel
the environment is exciting and that the leadership is there to
provide the kind of place where their career is constantly
renewing and growing. This essentially is most of my work-- to 
see that they reach their maximum potential to grow.</text>

to the impact of different models: 
? The effects of history (the founders model)

          <text>The Commitment Model
Attachment to people or culture 
Select for cultural fit Cultural/peer control 
I wanted to b uild the kind of company where peo ple would 
only leave when they retire. 
I think people should be trea ted as human beings, as real
people. And really care for them. We are still pretty much like
family. We try to keep as much of that as possible even as the
company is bigger. Thats one think I learned from HP 
[Hewlett-Packard]. Bill Hewlett still  flipped hamburgers for us at
the comp any picnic.</text>

? Time to IPO 
? Commitment model most likely/fastest t o go public (and, to a
lesser extent, star models) . 
? Hybrid models are the slowest/l east likely to go public. 
? Likelihood of failure 
? All other things equal, commitme nt firms are significantly less
likely to fail (disap pear, de-listing , liquidation). 
? Post-IPO Performance 
? Star firms have the largest post-IPO increases in market cap,
followed closely by commitment firms. 
? Autocracy firms per form the wo rst, followed by engineering.</text>

One thing we wanted to avoi d was consensus management. I 
think it lends it self to majo r slow-downs in development 
schedules. We have good c ommunication around a core group, 
but we certainly know who makes the call on things We dont 
have the resources available to spend a lot of time getting 
everyone warm and fuzzy rather than to a decision.

          <text>Effects of Changing the Model 
? Changing the Founders Model 
? Is most likel y to occur when the CEO is replaced 
? Is more likely to occur with star and commitment models 
? Is most likel y to change toward a bureaucracy 
? Is associated with a lower probability of IPO 
? Increase s the likelihood of failure 
? Has less growth in market cap after going public 
?	Tends to have more disruptive effects when the move is away 
from one of the basic blueprints. 
?	Is higher when models shift towa rd a bureaucracy or hybrid and 
lower in a shift to an engineering model.</text>

Attachment to challenging work

We w ere very committed . It was a skunk-works mentality and 
the binding energy was very high. 
We wanted to assemble teams of people who are turned on by 
difficult  problems. The emphasis was to build an environment 
of individuals who are performance driven, achievement 
oriented, customer focused, feel relatively at ease to join and 
disband from specific  teams, skilled at interdisciplinary problem 
solving irrespective of culture or disc ipline.</text>

Control by formal procedures
Were not hierarchical as much as we are procedures,
methodologies, and systems. I really try to see that everybody
in the c ompany maintains proced ures rather than just hand
wave and do things any way. We dont  want to be so 
hierarchical as to be startling, nor do we want to be so flat as to 
have everybo dy poking into everyb ody elses business. 
We make sure things are documented, have job descriptions
for people, project descriptions , and pretty rigorous project
management techniques.</text>
