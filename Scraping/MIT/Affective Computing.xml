But the person  wouldn t frustrate 
people if he/she was only more intelligent ? 
 
Fact:  The most intelligent people are still 
frustrating (at least sometimes).   
People and computers can t always prevent frustration.  Thus, they 
should be prepared to handle it intelligently.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that one suicide 
happens every 40 seconds, and that suicide is increasing at a rate 
that is predicted to be 1 suicide every 20 seconds by the year 
2020  
 
Major Depressive Disorder is the leading cause of disability in the 
U.S. for ages 15-44. (World Health Org. 2004)  
 
Depression affects 30 million adults in the U.S.  (Kessler et al 
2003)  
 
41,149 suicides were reported in 2013 (CDC 2013)

How many times does it seem like
I've interrupted you today?
more than 30
times
25-29
20-24
15-19
less than 15
times
Sorry for so many
interruptions.  It'd be
great if you could give
me feedback how to be
less frustrating.
Give feedback now
Ask me later
No thanks
Thanks so much for
all your input today.  I
hope I wasn't too
frustrating. See you
tomorrow - bye.
Give feedback
Bye!

          <text>The cover story we told subjects was that we 
had a new, high-tech, Web-based game 
prototype we needed them to evaluate, but to 
do their absolute  best at.  Two $100 prizes 
would be given to the top two scorers, and get 
this,  even novice gamers could do well, since 
success was based on intelligence (and these 
were mostly MIT students, so this got them 
going).

Strategy:    
1. Recognize situation as frustrating 
2. Is user willing to talk?  If so: 
 Practice active listening, with empathy and 
sympathy 
 Sorry to hear 
your experience wasn t better 
 This computer apologizes to you for    
 Allow for repair 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evaluation:   
Build it.  Test this AFFECT -SUPPORT  with 70 subjects 
against two control conditions:  IGNORE and VENT.

 1. You can t always fix the problem at the time the user is 
frustrated.  
 
 2. You can still help:  actively support someone in their ability to 
regulate, manage, and recover from their own negative emotional 
states.

          <text>Heres the 6 conditions again, from a different view.  We ran 70 subjects, half men half women, 
and heres what they did: first they were briefed on the cover story from a script.  Then they 
played a timed game for 5 minutes, in which the user directs a character to go through a maze 
and find treasure we deliberately designed it to be boring, and users confirmed this.  Folks in 
the top half of this diagram just played the game, but subjects in the bottom  of this diagram got 
nailed.    
 
(POINT)  See it only appeared  to be a web browser (the whole thing was done in Director).  
During the five minutes of timed play, we faked a mess of web-server delays, so that the 
character was frozen to the user s controls but the on -screen timer continued to elapse.  This 
was the DELAY condition.  
 
Then subjects answered one of three apparent on-line questionnaires:  One asked questions 
about the user and the game through radio buttons, not allowing the user to report anything 
related to a problem.  The second questionnaire asked some of the same questions as the first, 
but then enabled subjects to report the problem and describe any emotional reaction.  The third 
questionnaire started out like the first two, but then turned into the AFFECT-SUPPORT agent I 
showed you. 
 
All subjects were then asked to play the game a second time for at least 3 minutes, after which 
they could quit at any time (up to a 20 minute max).  This time there was no prize or any other 
incentive to play for any length of time.
