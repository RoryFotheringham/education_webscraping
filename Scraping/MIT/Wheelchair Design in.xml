          <text>February 16, 2007THE DETERMINISTIC DESIGN PROCESS
Start vague and gradually become specific
1. Strategy: A PLAN of how to do something 
(with no specific embodiment)
2. Concept: Idea for DEVICE to fulfill need 
(rough physical picture)
3. Module: Important aspect of design (ex-
linkage, motor, color scheme)
4. Component: Specific part design

Read Nothing about us without us
 Focus on designing for specific problems and utilizing 
local materials
Read 2.007 Design Process notes
Watch remainder of workshop movies 
Coordinate with lab instructor and choose 
lab time
 I will email each team who their lab instructor is and 
make email lists 
Email mentors and community partners
Start working on defining functional requirements for your project
 Ask your community partners and mentors for input

          <text>February 16, 2007BE DETERMINISTIC AT EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS
FRDPARRC: Your new best friend
FR= Functional Requirements (WHAT the design has to do)
DP= Design Parameters (HOW the design is going to meet the FR)
A= Analysis (justify your decisions; can be qualitative or quantitative)
R= Research (dont reinvent the wheel)
R= Risk (what is going to bit you in the ass if it doesnt work?)
C= Countermeasure (If S*#T hits fan, how c an you maintain progress?)
Identify your Design Freedoms :What elements of the 
local environment or available resources can you capitalize on? 
Identify your Design Constraints :What material/ 
processes/resources/knowledge/et c can you absolutely not use?
ITS TIME TO DESIGN!
Example: FR  Allow a person who is disabled to have

Make engineering choices for a reason
 Determine what best engineering decision
 Example Factors: cost, size, time, color, etc. 
Manage your projects effectively
 Time, money, performance
Always have a backup plan
 First rule of engineering  it rarely works 
perfectly the first time

Motivation: Engage many bright students 
in advancing wheelchair technology 
Activities of students in the class: 
 Use science and technology to improve the lives 
of others 
 Learn the technical, social, and economic 
factors preventing appropriate wheelchair 
technology from being implemented 
 Study engineering, business, and biomechanics 
theory in context of wheelchairs 
 Work in teams, collaborating with developing 
country partners and wheelchair specialists, to 
design and prototype wheelchair technology

Worlds disabled 
	 The World Bank and other authorities estimate that there are as 
many as 600 million persons with disabilities around the world , 
making them one of the largest minority groups of unserved, 
marginalised people. (UNESCO Bangkok) 
	 About 600 million people in the world experience disabilities of 
various types. 80% of the world's disabled people live in low-
income countries ; the majority of them are poor and do not have 
access to basic services including rehabilitation facilities. (World Health Organization) 
	 Between 20 and 50 million people globally are estimated to be 
injured or disabled in road traffic accidents each year . (World 
Health Organization, 2004) 
	 Close to ten million severely or moderately disabled people are 
added each year to the total global figure  or about 25,000 every 
day. (Helander, 1999) 
	 70% of disabled people in developing countries are estimated to live in rural areas (Groce, 1999)

          <text>Disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty . 
Eliminating world poverty is unlikely to be achieved unless the rights 
and needs of people with disabilities is taken into account. (UK 
Department of International Development) 
	 In Tanzania, households with disabled members are 20% more likely to be living in poverty . (UK Department of International 
Development, 2005) 
	 98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not 
attend school. Earlier studies by UNESCAP and UNICEF show that this deplorable condition also applies to the Asia-Pacific region, where only around 2% of children with disabilities  one in every fifty children  have access to education of any sort. (UNESCO Bangkok) MOTIVATION 
Consequences due to lack of mobility 
	 Worldwide, only 2% of disabled children get any schooling . 
(Action on Disability and Development, 2006) 
	 Men, women and children who are discriminated against often 
end up excluded from society, the economy and political 
participation . They are more likely to be poor. (UK Department of 
International Development, 2005) 
	 Women and girls with disabilities face double discrimination based on disability and gender. As a group, they fare far worse 
than nondisabled women or disabled men on most indicators of 
financial, educational and vocational success. (Mobility International 
USA, 2002)

Need for wheelchairs 
	 The WHO and Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), 
estimate that only 1-3% of people with disabilities in the 
South who require rehab services have access to them . 
(Helander, 1999) 
	 Most people who sustain a spinal cord injury in the South 
die within two years , compared to a normal life expectancy 
in the North. (Werner, 1998) 
	 Conservative estimates put the number of people with 
disabilities in developing countries at close to half a billion. Of these, an estimated 20 million require wheelchairs to 
be mobile . (United States Agency for International 
Development, 2003) 
	 An estimated 95% of people who need a wheelchair dont 
have one . (Werner, 1998) 
	 Below 1% of the need for wheelchairs in Africa is being 
met through local production . (United Nations 
Development Project, 2002)

          <text>CLASS ACTIVITY 
Measuring human power output 
Next class: Meet in lab 
Break into teams of 4 to 5, get a mobility aid from office , 
and go to tunnels in basement 
Tasks: 
	 Measure the rolling resistance of your teams mobility aid and 
calculate the coefficient of rolling friction 
	 Measure your MAX mechanical power output on a flat surface for 
each person in the group (must travel at least 50 feet). Can use rolling start to negate transient effects. 
	 Estimate the angle of one of the tunnel ramps (you can do this mathematically and/or experimentally  dont just eyeball it) 
	 Measure each group members mechanical power out while going up a ramp. (Note: one wheelchair team should go up backwards)

Considerations during assessment 
Wheelchair Foundation in Tanzania 
Considerations during prescription
	Diagnosis and prognosis 
	Age 
	Communication status 
	Cognitive function 
	Perceptual function 
	Physical ability 
	Level of independence in activities 
during daily living 
	Transfer ability and modality 
	Mobility (ambulation and wheelchair
mobility)
	Body weight 
	Sensory status 
	Presence of edema 
	Leisure interests 
	Transportation to and from home 
	Roughness of usage 
	Time spent in wheelchair daily 
	Financial resources of patient 
List from (Mayall, 1995) Tanzania Big Game Safari: 
Largest donator in Tanzania, giving away 
nearly 7,000 chairs so far. 
Said Wheelchair Foundation will give a 
chair to anyone who seems to need one  
a loose requirement that may include people who are crawling on the ground to people who may walk with a crutch. 
Admitted they get so many chairs every 
year that after the first few hundred have 
been distributed, it is very difficult to find genuinely disabled people to whom they can give them. 
Monduli Rehab Center: 
Criticized the WC Foundation and said 
wheelchairs should not be given out like 
candy. 
Because the village terrain is so rough, 
people should be encouraged to walk with 
crutches or braces, and WCs should be a last resort.

Safety factors 
Uncertainties in strength
p= y/ns 
Where p = permissible stress, 
y = yield strength, 
ns = strength factor of safety
(typically 1.2 to 1.4)
Uncertainties in Loading
Fp = Fy/nL 
Where Fp = permissible load, 
Fy = max load, 
nL = strength factor of safety
ntotal = n s nL 
For machines that can cause injury or death, ntotal is typically 4 to 10+
When choosing a safety factor, consider: 
Does the load come from human activity 
Does loading come from natural sources (terrain, etc) 
What are the consequences of failure? 
Is the loading due to a prelaod? 
Does the load come from a power source (ex. starting vs. steady torque)? 
Does the load come from driven machinery that can change its output?

Complications from improper fitting 
Sitting habits 
	Able bodied person  long period of sitting 
usually 1-2 hours, shifting weight all the time 
	Disabled person may sit for 3 to 10 hours per day without repositioning 
Complications due to poor posture 
	Contractions and deformities 
	Tissue breakdown 
	Reduced performance and tolerance 
	Urinary and respiratory infection 
	Fatigue and discomfort
