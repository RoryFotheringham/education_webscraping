Problem of practice: How can states design
family-friendly approaches to school report cards thatmake school data more transparent and accessible?
Existing solutions: This information is a key resource tohelping parents and communities understand how theirschool is performing, evaluate what is working and whatneeds to change, and drive changes that help kidssucceed. Yet, few current report cards are not accessibleto the public. What do you think about Massachusettsschool report cards?

Opportunity 8: Making Learning Accessible to All Students
Addressing students differing educational needs  so that all learners
can participate in learning activities
Functionality (e.g. font size, text read aloud)
Address specific learning needs  (e.g. digital word board)
Personalize learning  to adapt to variety of learner needs
Resources: CAST website , National Center for Learning Disabilities
Generally content should be communicated in multiple forms
Features that  customize delivery must not clutter or confuse
Important note:  Schools will not be able to use your innovation if it
is not accessible to students with disabilities
See guidance on two civil rights laws, Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act  and the Americans with Disabilities Act

Opportunity 9: Closing Opportunity Gaps
Unequal access to resources or opportunities (e.g. rural students,
less wealthy communities)
Technology gaps
All students have a right to an equitable education (see US Dept. of
Education Office of Civil Rights Dear Colleague Letter )
Innovation opportunities: tools that make reams of open education
resources (OER) easier to sift through, teachers access to expertise
Be mindful of technical accessibility/connectivity
Opportunity 10: Closing Achievement Gaps
Relatedly, achievement gaps persist in the U.S. on standardizedtests, Advanced Placement (AP) course enrollment, completion, testing(e.g. females and minorities are underrepresented in AP ComputerScience)

Opportunity 7: Improving Educator Productivity
Reducing educator administrative burden  (e.g. preparing lessons,
grading, finding teaching materials, grading, reporting,
communicating with parents)
Areas for innovation include tools that help teachers personalize
student learning, facilitating feedback to students/parents, tools tocreate, share, and adapt lesson plans and resources with othereducators, make sense of data, track student progress (one example isthe Ellevation software )
Need for custom productivity tools  found in other professions

Opportunity 5: Designing Effective AssessmentsSource: USED (2015)
Teachers must know what students know and what they are learning
Need for efficiencies- teachers spend hours reviewing and grading!
Well-designed formative and summative assessments  can provide
just-in-time feedback, personalize learning, and adjust instruction
Innovation opportunities  include tools for teachers to share and
create formative assessments, automate grading, streamline feedback,
more sophisticated test questions (simulations, heat maps, ranking)
Opportunity 6: Improving Educator Professional Devt (PD)
Just-in-time  professional, personalized  learning also benefits
educators through teaching tips, access to experts
PD should be job-embedded, differentiated, on-demand access, align
with adult learning standards  (e.g. growth mindset)

1. When asked if scores on the end of the unit test would be an accurate students responded
a. The tests were hard. Im just not good at tests and I get all nervous and then I dont know what to
do.
b. I dont know why we have to take all these tests anyway. When I need to put together something,
like the other day my mom got a new vacuum . . . and she was reading the directions for like anhour and couldnt put it together and I just looked at it and figured out how to do it in 10 minutes.
c. The problem with those tests is that all the words sound so much alike in my head. First I think I
know the answer, then I think its something else, then I just get confused. Usually I give up whenthat happens.

Setting - Think about where, when, and how users will experience 
your learning experience. Be as specific as possible. 
Design should fit learning objective - Make sure that there is a 
clear relationship between your proposed design and the learning 
objective of the practice spac. 
Scaffold reflection - Include scaffolding mechanisms such as 
reflection questions to guide reflection - dont assume that people 
will be able to interpret data without guidance.
Integrate feedback - Think about ways that the practice space can 
provide feedback to teachers on how they are doing while they are 
going through the practice space.

Practices spaces are learning experiences
that help teachers practice and reflect 
on key teaching decisions. 
!Teaching is complex
!Teachers have limited opportunities
to practice specific skills
!Technology as a way to scale up
teacher learning and feedback
!Focus on authenticity of task ratherthan authenticity of setting

Research on deliberate practice (Ericsson, Krampe, &amp;
Tesch-Rmer, 1993; Ericsson, 2002) which found thatrepetition and feedback are critical to improvingperformance
New teachers have few opportunities to practice. Mostteacher preparation programs do not give studentsopportunities to apply skills until they are already inthe classroom.

Goal: to prototype, test, and refine an innovative edtech 
solution to a problem of practice in education
Three possible paths (working individually or in pairs):
Option 1: identify an extension of one of your mini-projects-- must 
reflect a substantial new contribution to your project
Option 2: identify a project of your own choosing, in consultation with 
the instructor(s)
Option 3: remix a classmates project-- must ask their permission and 
also must reflect a substantial new contribution to the project

After reviewing your design journal reflection slide at 
the end of each mini-project: (1) Which proposed improvements do you feel more excited about? (2) Which improvements seem most promising to you? (3) Of the the potential extensions you have identified, what challenges do you anticipate in implementing your own recommendations? You may also conclude that none of your mini-projects are suitable for further exploration and propose a new innovation for a user/partner of your choosing.
You may include text plus images, sketches, code, or other 
media in your response. Be prepared to share your responses in class.

          <text>Related Fields or Concepts
Academic Analytics: More focused on the institutional 
side, e.g. use of resources or admission process
Action Research: Focused on teaching practices and quality, e.g. qualitative methods, teachers and students
Educational Data Mining: Developing methods, different types of ed data e.g. new Item Response Theory (IRT) algorithm or method adapted feedback
Recommender Systems: Based on previous data, what items can we recommend? Content-based or Collaborative Filtering (CF)
Personalized Adaptive Learning: Adaptivity (course materials adapt automatically) vs. Adaptability (learners personalize those materials)

          <text>activity: Brainstorming around these questions
No looking at the papers! Use your critical thinking skills 
to answer the following questions: 
Define your own view of learning analytics, point outyour keywords
LA has grown a lot in the last decade. What have been theenablers and drivers?
What are the steps in the LA process? List examples ofeach step.
What value can LA bring to education?
What are the main challenges of LA?

          <text>More ideas - of varying technical complexity
1. Low complexity: Reports with summary statistics/charts
Mixed methods analysis on the influence of course in demographics and
participation funnel
MOOC summary report for high level stakeholders i.e. donors orinstitutional leaders e.g. see these reports
2. Medium complexity: Viz dashboards or data mining
Viz dashboards: Tableau Public  or R Shiny dashboard for Administrators
or Instructors? E.g. see this post
Classification or regression models? E.g. see this study
Clustering of different profiles of students or courses
3. High complexity: Advanced analysis or combination
Combining visualization dashboards with data mining
Anomaly detection to find outliers, e.g. maybe to detect academicdishonesty or data processing issues
Network analysis of courses/students

          <text>HarvardX-MITx Dataset items
The dataset has three items
Creating the dataset and anonymization process:
EdX and ToS, raw data, edx2bigquery processing,
anonymization (careful with quasi-identifiers, e.g.Netflix challenge)
A codebook (i.e. description  the contents,
structure, and layout of a dataset )
A comma-delimited file with the person-course data
where each row represents the registration of an
account to a course
Why is this dataset important?19</text>

          <text>Stakeholders (Who?)
Who is involved?
Students (personal data, help in learning, evaluation)
Teachers (improve teaching, not feeling controlled, new
literacy and competencies)
Educational institutions and administrators (supportdecision making, students at risk)
Private educational companies (selling their solutions)
Governmental institutions (funding, education policy)
Education technologists (implementation of solutions)
Learning Analytics researchers (transfer research topractice challenge)

          <text>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
The term MOOC was coined in 2008 after CCK08 (cMOOC)
In 2012 Coursera, edX and Udacity emerged (xMOOC)
Exciting for practitioners and for human development
Plenty of data to study the worldwide classroom
...but research did not accomplish a huge impact
A number of regional initiatives emerged (e.g.
Edraak, MiriadaX, XuentangX, FUN...)
Many of these use Open edX software
In 2013 Udacity announced first MOOC-based MSc
Seeking financial sustainability
Numerous Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs)18</text>

          <text>Objectives (Why?)
Multiple objectives depending on the point of view of 
stakeholders (useful ideas or in-depth references):
Monitoring and analysis: ANALYSE visualization dashboard
Prediction and intervention: Self-regulation intervention
Assessment and feedback: Immediate and adapted feedback
Adaptation: Exercise difficulty or gaming the system
Personalization and recommendation: Courses or threads
In-class support: Multimodal approaches in the classroomand real-world examples in China
