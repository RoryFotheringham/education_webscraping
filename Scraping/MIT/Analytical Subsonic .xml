The remaning boundary conditions belong to the inner region and are to be obtained by matching. 
We assume: 
i = U  
i 
0(x,z)+ i 1(x,z) + 2i 2(x,z) + ...  
z = z/ 
The stretching enables us to focus on the ow in the immediate neighborhood of the airfoil in the 
limit of   0 since the airfoil shape then remains independent of  and the width of the inner region 
becomes of order unity. 
The zeroth-order inner term is that of a parallel ow, that is: 
i 
0 = x 
(Both inner and outer ow must be parallel in the limit   0.) 
Examining the W-velocity component in the inner region, we may write: 
1   i i i iW =  =  = U  (x,z)+  (x,z)z z 1z 2z 
Since Q must vanish in the limit of zero , i 1 must be independent of z. Hence, let: 
1 i = g1(x) 
g1(x) may be different above and below the airfoil 
We now write: 
i = U  
x + g1(x)+ 2i 
2(x,z)+ ...  
Substituting the above equation into the governing equation and boundary conditions, we obtain: 
i = 02zz 
d f u i2z = for z = f u(x)dx 
d f l  i 2
z = for z = fl (x)dx 
The the solution must be linear in z, 
d f u i2 = z + g2u (x) , z  f udx 
d  i fl2 = z + g2l (x) , z  f ldx

          <text>The inner solution cannot give vanishing disturbances at innity since the boundary condition be -
longs to the outer region. We need to match the inner and outer solutions. 
We will employ the asymptotic matching principle to complete the required matching. From 
i above we note that Wi is independent of z to lowest order. Thus, in the outer limit at z =  , 
we have: 
1 d f uWi 0 i= z(x,) =   dx 
and 
0W 0 = 1z 
Equating the inner limit ( z = 0+), we obtain: 
d f u 0 (x,0+) = 1z dx 
d  0 fl (x,0) = 1z dx 
Matching the potential, we nd: 
0g1u (x) = 1(x,0+) 
To determine g2 it is necessary to include higher order terms in the outer solution. 
First, we write the two-term outer ow in inner variables, 
  
0 = U x + 0
1(x,z)+ ... 
Taking the three term inner expansion of this: 
  
0 = U x + 01(x,0+)+ 2z0(x,0+)+ ...1z 
Rewriting the above equation in outer variables: 
 0 0 0 = U x + 1(x,0+)+ z (x,0+)+ ...1z 
The three-term inner expansion, expressed in outer variables, reads: 
 d f u  
i = U x + g1u (x)+ z + 2g2u (x)+ ... dx 
Now equate the two-term outer expansion of the three term inner expansion: 
 d f u  
i = U x + g1u (x)+ z + ... dx 
To the three term inner expansion of the two-term outer expansion leads to: 
g1u = i 0(x,0+) 
d f u0
1z (x,0+) = dx 
And Cp takes the following form: 
0Cp = 21x (x,0)

          <text>= Small dimensionless quantity measuring maximum cross wise extension of the airfoil 
We will treat two dimensional ow. Extension to three dimensions is straightforward. We week the 
leading terms in a series expansion in  of . We have shown the governing equations to be: 
2 2(a2  x )xx + (a2  z )zz  2x z xz = 0

The boundary conditions are: 
 A) Q = U i ,(x,z)   
B) Flow is tangent to the airfoil surface 
d f uz /x =  ,z =  f udx 
d f lz /x =  ,z =  f ldx 
C) Pressure is continuous at the trailing edge - Kutt-Jovkowsky condition 
Assume in outer expansion: h i 
0 = U 0(x,z)+ 0
1(x,z) + ... 
Since the airow in the limit of   0 collapses to a line parallel to the free stream, the zeroth order 
term must represent parallel undisturbed ow. Thus,

Perturbation Methods / Overview 
1 O VERVIEW 
1. Regular/straight perturbation method 
a) Systematically generates approximations order by order 
b) Proceeds to higher degree of approximations by generating corrections of higher-
order in the expansion parameter,  
c) Breaks down when higher-order perturbation solutions fail (less accuracy) in a do-main of interest: nonuniformity of the perturbation expansion 
2. Types of nonuniformities 
a) Secular - nonuniformity occurs as t   
b) Singular - nonuniformity occurs as t  0 
c) Boundary layer - systems, resulting in a loss of boundary conditions 
2 S ECULAR NONUNIFORMITY 
Approximations break down (inaccurate) for large values of t. 
Example: 
dx + x = 0,x(0) = 1,0 &lt;  &lt;&lt; 1 dt 
Apply regular perturbation theory and obtain:

          <text>Consider: 
dx (t + ) + x = 0,x(1) = 1 dt 
Substitute: 
x(t;) = x0(t)+ x1(t)+ ... 
Obtain: 
dx0 t + x0 = 0 dt 
dx1 dx0 t + x1 =  dt dt 
dxn dxn1 t + xn =  dt dt 
Zeroth order solution: 
1 x0(t) = t 
First order solution: 
1 1 x1(t) =  tt2 
Hence to O() 
1 1 1 x(t;) = + (  )t tt2 
Problems! 
x0(t) is singular at t = 0 
x1(t) is more singular at t = 0 
x1(t) is better than x0(t) for large values of t 
Exact solution: 
1 +  x(t;) = t +  
Expanding above for large values of t: 
1+   x(t;) = (1 + ...) t t

          <text>or 
x0 c2 x1(s) =  (t1 + 1) + s s 
And x0 = 1/s to satisfy the boundary conditions. Thus, unless t1 = 1, x1(s) will be more singular 
than x0(s). With t1 = 1, we have 
t = s + t1(s)+ ... = s   
so 
t = s   
or 
s = t +  
Hence, substituting 
c1 c1 x(t;)  | s(t) = s t +  
c1 = arbitrary constant 
Note the uniformity condition at the rst order led to the correct change of variables and the 
exact solution. This procedure can be applied at each order as required.

          <text>Can write

Substitute and re-write transformed governing equation: 
d dt1[s + t1(s)+ ...+ ] [ x0(s)+ x1(s)+ ...]+ (1+  + ...)[x0(s)+ x1(s)+ ...] ds ds 
Equating like powers of 1 to rst order: 
sx0 0+ x0 = 0 
0 0 0sx1 + x1 = [(t1 + 1)x0 + t1x0] 
dxn 0x n ds 
Zeroth order solution 
c1 x0(s) = s 
c1 = arbitrary constant 
Note x0(s) is singular at s = 0 
x(s : ) is uniform as  0, provided x1(s) is no more singular than x0(s). That is, as s  0, x1(s) 
1cannot be singular like s , &gt; 1. This means that higher-order perturbation solutions are no 
more singular than lower-order ones. Hence, 
x0t1 0+ (t1 + 1)x0 0= 0 
Solving for t1(s) we have 
t1 = 1 
and 
0 0 0sx1 + x1 = [( t1 + 1)x0 + t1x0] 
Takes the form 
d d (sx1) =  [x0(t1 + 1)]ds ds 
Integrating 
sx1 = x0(t1 + 1)+ c2

Solve recursively 
2t2 ntn 
x(t;) = 1 t +  ...+ (1)n + ... 2! n! 
For a complete, convergent, summable innite series we may write: 
tx(t;) = e 
Which is the exact solution to the above problem. If summation is not possible (general term 
cannot be determined), we truncate series and write: 
n n X X 
ix(t;) = xi (t) = (1)i iti 
i !0 i =0 
Problems! 
So long as t = O(1) or less 
2t2 
x(t;) = 1  t +  ... 2! 
Is a good approximation. But for t  O(1), accuracy begrades as n increases. Hence x(t;) =  
x0(t)+x(t)+... is secularly nonuniform [it breaks down for large values of t]. Use multiple time 
scales method to solve this problem.

Velocity gradients near axis are very large. Continuity equation yields:

vr = a0 + a1r + a2r 2 + ...

For a line source, we let A be the volume of uid sent out per unit time per unit length of the 
line source. Recall the line source: 
A (x,r ) = p
(x2 + r 2) 
For a distribution of sources, we write: 
A(x) f (x)(x,r ) = p = p
(x2 + r 2) ( x2 + r 2) 
At a distance r , the ow is distributed uniformly over a cylindrical surface with a circumference 
of 2r . Hence, at any x: 
f (x)  v = = 2r r 
At the surface of the slender body: 
  v dR = U+ uR dx 
or 
  v dR = U R dx 
Therefore: 
dR vR = U dx 
Substituting: 
f (x) dR = U2R dx 
dR f (x) = 2UR dx 
Any any x: 
S(x) = R2 
Therefore: 
S0(x) = 2R dR

Consider the boundary condition on the airfoil surface. 
y = f (x), airfoil shape in x, y (1.21) 
 = q(), airfoil shape in ,  (1.22) 
Our boundary condition may be expressed as follows: 
d f  1 e e 
U= = = (1.23) dx y  y  
(x, y) space 
Similarly in (, ) space 
dq e 
U= (1.24) d  
(,) space 
Therefore, 
d f dq U= U (1.25) dx d 
or 
d f dq = (1.26) dx d 
Conclusions 
(a) The shape of the airfoil in x, y space is the same in ,  space. 
(b) e,, implies that the compressible ow over an airfoil in x, y space is related to an incom-
pressible ow in , space over the same airfoil. 
Now, lets return to the pressure coefcient:

1 M2 (1.30) 
This is the Prandtl-Glauert rule. It is a similarity rule that relates incompressible ow over a given 
two-dimensional prole to subsonic compressible ow over the same prole. From above results, it can be shown that

For our assumed asymptotic sequence n , we balance the leading term with no contradiction, 
i.e., the distinguished limit: 
0() =  
Hence 
 0 = f 0(x) (x,0;M)y

There is no contradiction since 1 is determined from 0. This means that our perturbation 
solution yields a linearized boundary condition at the body surface at each order of n .

Consider the surface boundary condition. First, we expand y [x,f (x)] in a Taylor series about

y (x,f (x))  y (x,0)+ f (x)y y (x,0)+ ...

y (x,f (x))  U[00y (x,0;M)+ 11y (x,0;M)+ ...]+Uf (x)[00y y (x,0;M)+ ...] 
Thus:

We may also calculate  x (x,f (x)):

          <text>variables for large time are of order unity, they need not be rescaled or stretched. The independent 
variables must be stretched: 
 = 2t (4.1) 
To rescale the distance we note that for large time, i.e. inside the inner region, the outer solution may be approximated by their asymptotic expansions. This means that outside the "shock" everything is constant and our interest should be directed toward the shock interior. Hence as t   or   , we 
center the inner distance coordinate with the shock and stretch it by  to make the shock thickness 
on the inner scale to be order unity. Hence 
p 
q 
 = (x  t) =  2X (4.2) 
Substituting equations (4.1) and (4.2) into Navier-Stokes equations one obtains a redundant system of equations to rst order in . The redundancy is a result of stretching the x-coordinate as to make 
the inner equations inviscid to rst order. Expanding the inner dependent variables in a power series in   e.g. 
i i i  = 0 + i 
1 + 2 2 + ... (4.3) 
and substituting equations (4.1), (4.2), and (4.3) into the Navier-Stokes equations, we obtain 
1 1i i i i  + ( + 1)  =  (4.4) 2  2  
(Viscous dissipation - no dispersion) 
Equation (4.4) is Burgerss equation. 
The boundary conditions for equation (4.4) is obtained by matching the inner and outer solutions: 
( i )o = ( o )i (4.5) 
The inner solution is re-expressed in outer variables and re-expanded in  for xed x and t, the result 
ought to be the same as if the outer solution were put in inner variables and re-expanded for xed  
and . We obtain as initial conditions for  
i : 
( 
i (,0) = 0,  &gt; 0 (4.6) 
 i (,0) = 1,  &lt; 0 
Hence on the inner scale we have an initial value problem. First we transform  i : 
i 2   =  (4.7) ( + 1)  
Combining equations (4.4), (4.6), and (4.7) and integrating over , we nd 
1  =  (4.8) 2 
( 
(,0) = exp(( + 1)/2),  &lt; 0 (4.9) 
(,0) = 1,   0 
Equation (4.8) is the heat equation. Solution can be obtained by disturbing heat sources along the 
-axis. See Moran (1966). The inner solution when matched to the outer solution shows that the asymptotic matching principle is satised (as opposed to the limit matching principle).

2 B ACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION 
In the absense of friction and heat conduction (small gradients in velocity and temperature are as-
sumed), an isentropic disturbance will propagate without change in shape. The particle velocity under these conditions is governed by the wave equation: 

2u 
t2 2u2= a1 x2 (2.1) 
whose solution may be expressed as: 
u(x,t) = F (x  a1t) +G(x + a1t) (2.2) 
The wave propagates at the local speed of sound a1, where a1 is a constant. 
An acoustic wave of nite amplitude will propagate with shape being distorted in the process. The theoretical description is expressed in terms of non-linear equations. The wave speed for acoustic waves of nite amplitude is 
  + 1 c = a
1  u (2.3) 2 
n h   1 io + 1 2 c = a11  1 (2.4)   1 1 
Thus, the regions of higher condensation, (  ) &gt; 1, tend to overtake those of lower condensation. 1 
This non-linear steepening effect resulting from the convective terms of the equations of motion is 
1</text>
        </slide>
        <slide>
          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>eventually balanced by the diffusive terms. The diffusive terms become important as the velocity and 
temperature gradients become larger (steepening effect). When complete balance is obtained, the wave is then "stationary" and propagates without further distortion. 
Thus, for acoustic waves of nite amplitude one may anticipate two time scales. Physically the time 
scales would correspond to (a) the time in which the non-linear convective terms determine the na-ture of the wave propagation and (b) the time in which the diffusive terms are of the same order as the non-linear convective terms. 
3 T HE LINEARIZED SOLUTION 
We shall discuss the formation of weak plane shock waves by impulsive motion of a piston as treated by Moran and Shen (JFM, 1966). In this problem we also have two time scales. After the piston is set in motion the wave propagation is governed by the viscous diffusive terms resulting from the steep gradients in ow initially. This part of the wave propagation constitutes a time scale. The second time scale is characterized by the non-linear convective terms balancing the viscous diffusive terms, the initial gradients being smaller on this scale. 
Using a continuum ow formulation Moran and Shen consider the phenomenon for time large com-
pared with the mean time spent by a gas molecule between collisions. Denoting the piston Mach number by  the linearized Navier-Stokes equations may be shown to be valid up to time of the order 
of 1/
2 mean free times after the piston is set in motion. At large times the solution may be shown 
to be governed by Burgerss equation. Boundary conditions for the large time solution are obtained by applying the matching principle of the method of inner and outer expansions. In their analysis Moran and Shen assumed  to be small; the gas is viscous and heat conducting. 
The basic equations and non-dimensionalization are: 
    =  q 
RT0  ,  = 0(1+ ) (3.1) 
  p = p0 (1 + p), T = T0  (1+ T ) (3.2) 
where ( ) denotes a dimensional variable, R is the gas constant.  is a perturbation parameter, 
dened so that  = 1 on the piston.  is proportional to the piston Mach number. ( ) 0 enotes the 
undisturbed value of the variable. 
The viscosity is given by 
   = 0(1+ ) (3.3) 
The dimensionless independent variables x and t are given by 
n qo 
   x = 0/0 RT0  x (3.4) 
n o 
   t = 0/0 RT0  t (3.5) 
The exact Navier-Stokes conservation equations in a one dimensional unsteady ow may be written: 
t + x + ( )x = 0 (3.6) 
h i 
t + px  xx +  t + x  ( x )x + 2 x = 0 (3.7)

          <text>The linearized solution indicate a shock-like behavior at large times, i.e. the ow properties eventu -
ally exhibit a smooth transition between differing constant values. Also, the center of the transition 
propagates at the speed of sound (local) and the Pankine-Hugoniot relations are satised. 
Let qpX = (x  t)/ 2 (3.23) 
The asymptotic behavior of the linearized solution may be written: 
 h p i 
 o(x,t) ~ 1erfc X / t + o(t 21 )  2 
1o (x,t) ~ p  o (x,t)+ o(t 21 ) (3.24) 
 (1)To(x,t) ~ p  o(x,t)+ o(t 1
2 ) 
oWe also note that the relation between  ,o ,andT o is the same as that obtained by solving the prop -
agation of isentropic, innitesemal amplitude wave problem (the one-dimensional wave equation). 
p
From equation (3.24) we note that the width of the transition zones grows in time like t. The width 
of a weak shock in steady ow, in the above notation, is of order of 1/. Physically, we expect the solu -
tion of the piston problem to yield a steady (convective and diffusive terms enter to the same order)p
travelling shock as t   . This suggests that the linearized solution will break down when t = o 1 
 
or t = o( 1
2 ). A more formal argument leading to the above result is given in Moran (1966). 
4 T HE SOLUTION AT LARGE TIMES 
We now dene an "inner region" where t is of the same order or greater than 1/2. In the inner 
regions the "inner variables" and their derivatives are of order unity in the limit   0. Since the outer

The linearized solution is obtained by letting   . As expected from the physics of the problem, by 
letting    the non-linear convective terms are lost and the rst order viscous diffusive terms are 
retained. Our equation system reduces to the following linear set of equations:

          <text>SOLUTION AT LARGE TIMES ("INNER REGION ") 
Re-scale t: 
 = 2t (0.30) 
    p
(Linearized, outer solution breaks down when t = o 1 or t = o 1) 2 
Now require a shock thickness, on the inner scale, to be order unity: 
p q 
 = (x  t) =  2X (0.31) 
Expansion 
i i i  = 0 + 1 i + 2 2 + ... (0.32) 
Substitute into Navier-Stokes equations, and obtain Burgers equation: 
1 1i i i i  + ( + 1)  =  (0.33) 2  2 
Boundary conditions (matching principle): 
( i )o = ( o )i (0.34) 
Initial conditions 
 i (,0) = 0, &gt; 0 (0.35) 
 i (,0) = 1, &lt; 0 (0.36) 
Thus on the inner scale (large times) we have an initial value problem. 
Consider the transformation 
2   i =  (0.37) ( + 1)  
Burgers equation becomes: 
1  =  (0.38) 2 
(Heat conduction equation) 
( + 1)(,0) = exp( ), &lt; 0 (0.39) 2 
(,0) = 1, &gt; 0 (0.40) 
Match inner and outer solutions using the asymptotic matching principle (not the limit matching 
principle).

The pressure coefcient may be written

Likewise:

Therefore:

Two airfoils of the same family of shapes characterized by the thickness ratios T 1 and T 2 have 
pressure distributions given by coefcients Cp1 and Cp2. If the mach numbers of the ows are 
M1 and M2, respectively, then Cp1 = Cp2 provided:

A1A = A2 
Or, formally:

This restriction allows us to express the perturbation velocity potential as: 
(x,z, t) = (x,z) +  (x,z,t) (5.4) 
Where (x,z) and its derivatives are much greater than  (x,z,t) and its derivatives. The above 
formulation is valid for small unsteady perturbations. 
Within the above restrictions, equation (4.7) becomes: 
h  i 
1 M2  M2( + 1) x xx + zz = 0 (5.5) 
h  i 
1 M2  M2( + 1) x  xx  M2( + 1) xxx (5.6) 
+  t  2M2 zz  M2(  1) xx xt  M2 tt = 0 
Where we set M= M, why? 
Note that equation (5.5) is non-linear and steady. It is used to simulate thickness, camber, and 
mean angle of attack. 
Note that equation (5.6) is linear and unsteady. It is strongly coupled to equation (5.5).

Singular Perturbation Method 
What formal analytical methods do we apply to solve "boundary layer" problems? 
What formal analytical methods do we apply to solve differential equations where in the limit of a 
small parameter vanishing, one or more highest-order derivative terms drop out? 
What formal analytical methods do we apply to solve problems where competing physical mech-
anisms vary over time? 
To "answer" the above questions, we introduce the singular perturbation method. In applying the 
singular perturbation method (SPM), one should 1. focus on competing physical mechanisms, 2. identify a small parameter, and/or 3. observe that the governing differential equation degenerates in the limit of a small parameter vanishing. 
Consider the mass-string-damper system shown in the gure below. 
m = body mass, constant 
d = viscous damping constant 
k = spring constant 
I = applied impulse, at t = 0 
t = time 
x = displacement 
Governing equation and boundary conditions: 
d2x dx m + d + kx = 0 dt2dt 
x(0) = 0 
 dx I u(0) = = dtt=0 m 
The completing physical mechanisms are:

Exact solution: s    I mk  2t  e 1tx = e 1  4 d d2 
s   d mk 1,2 =  1 1  4 2m d2 
For large I and small m, the competing forces are acceleration forces and damping forces in the ini -
tial stages (small times). 
For large times, after the mass has reached its maximum deviation, the competing forces are damp-
ing and spring constant. 
Solutions valid for small times are called inner solutions. 
Solutions valid for small times are called outer solutions. 
Note for the mass-spring-damper problem: 
h iI2 (d /m)tInner solution: x = 1  e d 
I0 (k /d)tOuter solution: x = e d 
We now apply SPM to solve the above problem. First, introduce dimensionless variables: 
k d  t = t x = x d I 
Substitute and obtain: 
d2x dx 
  + + x = 0 dt2 dt 
  dx 1

We will consider a slender body immersed in a uniform ow, viz., 
in the uniform ow: 
Q = Ui 
in the perturbed ow: 
Q = ui + v j + wk 
0 0 0 Q = (U+ u )i + vj + wk 
Q =  
Now dene a perturbation velocity potential, ( x, y,z), where 
0  u = x 
0  v = y 
0  w = z 
 (x, y,z) = Ux + (x, y,z) 
Using the notation in eqn(*): 
0   u = U+ w = = U+ x x 
0   v = v = = y y 
0   w = w = = z z 
2 xx = = xx x2

          <text>since, p = p(),  = 0 
 Q  1 1+ Q2 +  p = 0 t 2  
or   1 Z p + Q2 + = 0 t 2  
therefore Z  1 dp + Q2 + = f (t)t 2  
Absorb f (t) into  and obtain Z  1 dp + Q2 + = constant t 2  
Differentiate above equation with respect to time, t: 
2  Q 21  +Q  + a = 0 t2 t  t 
Expressing the continuity equation in terms of :

Linear momentum equation rewritten yields

Combining the above three equations yields:

          <text>Example Problem - Illustration 
Consider the dynamics of an incompressible uid ow with constant. 
Equation of incompressibility: 
Dp   = + ui = 0 Dt t xi 
Equation of continuity: 
ui = 0 xi 
Introduce dimensionless variables: 
0 ui 0  0 p 0 xi 0 tU u = ,  = , p = x = , t = i iU 0 0U 2, L L 
U ,0,L  reference quantities

U  inertia forces Froude no: F =pgravity force 
UL  inertia force gL 
Reynolds no: Re =  viscous force 
F and Re must be the same for both ows. This is sufcient for dynamic similarity along with similar 
boundary geometry. 
U ,0,L may be different for both ows. 
4 E QUATIONS GOVERNING IRROTATIONAL FLOWS OF A HOMENTROPIC GAS 
For this class of ows the simplication is through the introduction of the velocity potential, , where 
Q =  
or 
 ui = xi 
and the vorticity is zero:  =  Q =  = 0 where  is the vorticity vector. 
The unsteady Bernoulli equation may be written, for this class of ows: 
 Q  1 1+ Q2 Qx =  pt 2

2.7 PRESSURE , VELOCITY RELATIONS IN ISENTROPIC FLOW 
With some effort, one may show: 
h  Q2 i  p   1 1 = 1+ M 21 p 2 u2  
Expanding the right-hand side: 
    2   3   4 p  Q2  Q2 (2 ) Q2 (2 )(3  2) Q2 
= 1+ 1 M 2 + 1 M 4 + 1 M 6 + 1 M 8 +... p 2 u 28 u 2 48 u 2 384 u 2 
Obtain an expression for 
p  p cp = 1 u2

Let 
V Q = u+ V,  1 U 
Find c p and discuss its limitations. 
3 S IMILARITY OF FLOWS 
3.1 REQUIREMENTS FOR SIMILARITY OF FLOWS 
1. Similarity in boundary geometry 
Boundary of one ow can be made to coincide with that of another if its linear dimensions are multiplied by a constant 
2. Dynamic constraint Dependent variables of one ow are proportional to those of another at the corresponding points.

          <text>8 C ROCCO S THEOREM 
Consider the motion of a uid element. The uid element may both translate and rotate. 
Let: 
v = translational velocity 
w = rotational velocity 
 = angular velocity 
where 1 w =  v 2 
 v  vorticity 
Combine Eulers equation, rst and second laws of thermodynamics: 
v  + (v )= pt 
pT s = h  vp = h   
h = h0  2v
2 
We obtain: 
T s = h0  v  (  v)+ v 
t n 
Croccos Theorem 
For steady ow, we obtain 
T s = h0  v  ( v) 
or 
v  ( v) = h0  T s 
For two-dimensional, steady ows:   1 s h02w = T  v n n 
Vorticity = rates of change of entropy and stagnation enthalpy normal to the streamlines

          <text>7 L INEARIZED PRESSURE COEFFICIENT 
Lets revisit the pressure coefcient, c p : 
p  p cp  1 
2 U 2  
where p is the pressure (local, static) at the location or point of interest in the ow eld. Note that cp 
is dimensionless. 
Since, 
1 1 p  U 2 U 2 = U 2 = p = pM 2 
2 2 p 2 a22 
then h i2 p cp =  1 M2 p  
for an inviscid, adiabatic, isentropic, steady ow and 
0 0 0 Q = (U+ u )i + vj + wk 
We show that 
h + 1 Q2 = h+ 1 U 2 
2 2 
which for a calorically perfect gas leads directly to 
T   1 U 2 Q2 
= T 2 a2  
  1 0 = 1 [2u U+ u 02 + v 02 + w 02]2a2  
Isentropic ow conditions lead to: h T i  p 1 = p T 
h 0 02 i  p   1  2u u02 + v02 + w 1 = 1 M2 + p 2  U U 2  
In the case of small velocity perturbations, 
0u  1 U 
 u0  2 n 1 U 
 0  2v n 1 U 
 0  2w n 1 U 
Using the binomial expansion, we show that 
 0 02  p  u u02 + v02 + w = 1  M22 + + ... p 2  U U 2  
therefore: 02u cp =  U 
Discuss the limitations implied in the above expression for c p .

          <text>2 xz = = xz xz 
Substituting  = Ux +  and multiplying eqn(*) by a2 we obtain the perturbation equation or per -
turbation velocity potential equation, for steady ow: 
[a2(U+x )2]xx +[a2( y )2]y y +[a2(z )2]zz 2(U+x )y xy 2(U+x )z xz 2 y z yz = 0 
Note a2 may be expressed as: 
2 2   1 0 02 + v 02 + w 02) a = a (2u U + u 2 
  12 2a = a (2 xU+ (x )2 + (y )2 + (z )2)2 
Also, note that eqn(**) is exact! It is also non-linear. 
5.1 PERTURBATIONS 
Assume the perturbations are small, viz., 
0 0 0 u v w  1;  1;  1 U U U 
In the limit of small perturbations, we may neglect the terms containing squares of the perturbation 
velocities in comparison to those containing rst powers. Eqn(**) with a2 substituted becomes 
x x y z(1M 2)xx +y y +zz = M 2(+1) xx +M 2(1) ( y y +zz )+2M 2 xy +2M 2 xz U U U U 
Note that each term on the right-hand side is non-linear. Each term on the right-hand side contains a perturbation velocity (
x ,y , or  z ). Hence, we may neglect the right-hand side in comparison to 
the left-hand side. We obtain 
(1 M 2)xx + y y + zz = 0 
5.2 QUESTIONS 
1. What is the equation where M 1? 
2. What is the equation where M 1? 
6 B OUNDARY CONDITIONS 
1. The body surface is a stream line. (inviscid, irrotational ows) 
2. Flow velocity must be tangent to body surface 
3. Velocity vector has to be orthogonal to the unit normal of the body surface

          <text>The body surface is described by f (x, y,z) 
f (x, y,z) = 0 
Boundary condition is expressed as 
Q  f (x, y,z) = 0 
or 
f ui = 0 xi 
Introducing the perturbation velocities 
0 u = U+ u 
0 v = v 
0 w = w 
Substituting, 
0 f f 0  f (U+ u ) + v + w = 0 x y z 
0 Since u  U, we may write: 
f 0 f 0 f U+ v + w = 0 x y z 
This equation must be satised on the surface of the body. Consider the two-dimensional case: 
0 w = 0 
f = 0 z 
We obtain: 0 v f /x d y =  = U f /y dx 
1 Therefore Uu 
 is the slope of the body (approximately) the slope of the streamline. Recall that 
 0  d y u = = Uy dx BODY 
Now for thin bodies, a small angle of attack, yBODY  0: this suggests an expansion of v 0 (x, y) in a 
powers of y: 
0  0 0  v v (x, y) = v (x,0) + y + ... yy=0 
 0  d y  v(x, y) = v (x,0) = U dx BODY 
For three-dimensional planar ows 
f = 0 z 
and the boundary condition becomes 
 0  y v (x,0,z) = U x BODY 
at innity: 
0 u  0 
0 v  0 
0 w  0 
0 0 0 or w ,v , and w are nite.
