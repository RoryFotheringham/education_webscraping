Richard Feynman, QED :
What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our 
physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate 
schooland you think Im going to explain it to you so 
you can understand it? No, youre not going to be able 
to understand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you 
with all this? Why are you going to sit here all this time, 
when you wont be able to understand what I am going 
to say? It is my task to convince you notto turn away 
because you dont understand it. You see, my physics 
students dont understand it either. That is because I 
dont understand it. Nobody does.</text>

          <text>TWO AIMS OF 
SCIENCE:
1. EXPLANATION:
Science should provide us with theories that render 
intelligible and unsurprising phenomena that would 
otherwise seem incomprehensibly mysterious.
Example: Fresnel spot.
Science should provide us with theories that can 
accurately and precisely predict the phenomena in 
their domains, in a non -ad hoc fashion .2. PREDICTION:
Example: Newtonian celestial mechanics.</text>

Richard Feynman, QED :
George Greenstein &amp; 
Arthur Zajonc, The In our view, modern research has only made 
the [quantum] theorys paradoxical nature 
more evident. Our thesis in this book is that 
the quantum universe forces upon us a 
radical revision in our conception of the 
physical world, a revision that has by no 
means been achieved. Our aim is not to 
accomplish this task, for we have no idea 
how this could be done. Rather, our aim is to 
make as vivid as possible the difficulties of 
interpretation posed by quantum mechanics.Quantum Challenge :</text>

Dreams of a Final 
Theory :Most physicists use quantum mechanics every day in 
their working lives without needing to worry about the 
fundamental problem of its interpretation. Being sensible 
people with very little time to follow up all the ideas and 
data in their own specialties and not having to worry 
about this fundamental problem, they do not worry about 
it. A year or so ago, while Philip Candelas (of the 
physics department at Texas) and I were waiting for an 
elevator, our conversation turned to a young theorist 
who had been quite promising as a graduate student and 
who had then dropped out of sight. I asked Phil what had 
interfered with the ex-students research. Phil shook his 
head sadly and said, He tried to understand quantum 
mechanics. WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY:</text>

Freudian psychology.)
One might have thought notuntil quantum 
mechanics came along. (By the way, how good are 
the predictions of quantum mechanics? Uncanny.
For example, here is Feynman, from QED :)Just to give you an idea of how the theory has been put 
through the wringer, Ill gi ve you some recent numbers: 
experi ments have Diracs number at 
1.00115965221
(with an uncertainty of about 4 in the last di git); the theory 
puts it at 
1.00115965246
(with an uncertainty of about fi ve times as much). To give 
you a feeling for the accuracy of these numbers, it comes 
out something like this: If  you were to measure the 
distance from Los Angeles to New York to this accuracy, it 
would be exact to the thickness of a human hair.</text>

          <text>WHAT IS QUANTUM 
MECHANICS?
Answer: The physical theory that describes the world on a 
very small scale.
However:
 Not just the small scalesince large things are made out of small things.
 Not just one theory, but a family of related theoriese.g., the quantum 
theory of particles, fields, strings, etc.
We will  focus on the simplest q uantum theory: the non-relativis tic 
quantum theory of particles.</text>

The End of 
Physics :The founding principle of classical physics is that a 
real, objective world exists, a world the scientist can 
understand in limitless detail. Quantum theory takes 
away this certainty, asserting that scientists cannot 
hope to discover the real world in infinite detail, not 
because there is any limit to their intellectual ingenuity 
or technical expertise, nor even because there are laws 
of physics preventing the attainment of perfect 
knowledge. The basis of quantum theory is more 
revolutionary yet: it asserts that perfect objective 
knowledge of the world cannot be had because there is 
no objective world.</text>

PHILOSOPHY?
One (passable) answer: The discipline that studies 
RIGOROUSLY! questions too fundamental to be of 
interest to anyone else.
Examples: Is there an external world? If so, how is knowledge 
about it possible? Etc.
Ground rules for philosophical discussion:
1. Be clear.
2. Be explicit.
3. Stay focused.
4. Be sincere!</text>

INEQUALITIES
WHAT DO THEY 
SHOW?
Two questions we can ask about a theory (in particular, 
a theory of the phenomena exhibited in the 
experiments that violate Bells Inequalities):
1. Is it local? 
YES NOCommon view:
What is ruled out is 
this option
and this option.YES

deterministic?

          <text>CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE
First step : Let us abandon the assumption of perfect correlation.
Second step : Let us try to devise as general a theory as possible 
(really, a framework for a theory) of the behavior of the particles in 
these experiments, making use only of locality and no-conspiracy 
assumptions.
Third step : Let us examine the theory  to see if it has any testable
predictions .
Fourth step : Let us check to see if the actual experiments conform 
to these predictions.
THEY DONT.</text>

          <text>1. Is it local?

2. Is it 
deterministic? This is a mistake . This option is ruled out by Bells Inequalities, 
plus the observed data:

NOThis is a mistake . This option is ruled out by Bells Inequalities, 
plus the observed data:
But this option is not, since it denies locality:
Whats more, this option was ruled out from the beginning, since
according to it, the perfect correlations are a massive coincidence :</text>

        <slide>
          <slideno>4</slideno>
          <text>A LOOPHOLE?
Consider the following objection:
The derivation of Bells Inequalities assumes that when 
1= 2, the outcomes will always be opposite; that is, 
that we have perfect (anti-) correlation, in such a case. 
But life in the real world of the laboratory is never so 
simple: correlations are always at least a little less than 
perfect. So we do not yet have an experimental refutation 
of locality, after all.
How might we respond to this objection?</text>

Suppose system Sis in a state represented by the unit vector . 
Suppose experiment Eis performed on S, where Eis

S2,}, with subspace Sicorresponding to outcome i .
To calculate Prob(outcome i) :
1. Project onto the subspace Si.
This can be done by pick ing an arbitrary orthonormal basis {1, 2, } forSi, and calculating
&lt; 1| &gt; 1+ &lt; 2|  &gt; 2+ 
2. Square the length of the resulting vector.
Given our choice of orthonormal basis {1, 2, } forSi, this w ill equal

Suppose the vector space for our system has five dimensions.
Suppose the experiment (measurement) we are going to 
perform on it has only four possible outcomes.
Still, we represent that experiment by an orthonormal basis
which must have five elements in it.
So: Two of the elements must correspond to the same

          <text>The basic principles of qm
(1) The physical state of any system is represented by a vector in some 
vector space (usually an infinite-dimensional vector space; note that 
this will be a different vector space for each different system). 
(2) If is a vector representing one possible physical state of some 
system, and is another vector representing another possible physical 
state of that system, then any arbitrary linear combination a+ b
also represents a possible physical state of the system. This is called 
the principle of superposition .
(3) Any experiment that can be performed on a system is represented 
by an orthonormal basis in the vector space for that system. Each 
basis element can be thought of as labeled with one of the possible 
outcomes of the experiment.
We will now amend this principle.</text>

Represent outcome 4 notby an orthonormal pair of vectors,
but rather by the subspace they span .
So: An experiment will now be represented by a set of
pairwise-orthogonal subspaces , each corresponding to a 
distinct outcome. These subspaces span the entire vector

Pairwise-orthogonal?

          <text>Hermitian operators 2
Some cool results:
1. If and are eigenvectors of (linear) operator A, with 
the same eigenvalue c, then so is (a+ b).
That means that for each eigenvalue cof A, there is a subspace consisting 
of all and only those vectors with eigenvalue cfor A. We call these 
subspace eigenspaces for A.
2. If and are eigenvectors of Hermitian operator A, with 
different eigenvalues, then and are orthogonal .
That means that for a Hermitian operator A, itseigenspaces are
pairwise-orth ogonal .
So a Hermitian operator automatically picks out a set of
pairwise-orthogonal subspaces, each labeled with a distinct
eigenvalue. That makes these operators particularly well 
suited to represent experiments .</text>

we are to represent such position measurements. It also turns out 
that the very same vector space can be used to represent

(1) The physical state of any system is represented by a vector in some 
vector space (usually an infinite-dimensional vector space; note that 
this will be a different vector space for each different system). 
(2) If is a vector representing one possible physical state of some 
system, and is another vector representing another possible physical 
state of that system, then any arbitrary linear combination a+ b
also represents a possible physical state of the system. This is called 
the principle of superposition .
(3) Any experiment that can be performed on a system is represented 
by an orthonormal basis in the vector space for that system. Each of 
basis element can be thought of as labeled with one of the possible 
outcomes of the experiment.</text>

          <text>Schrodingers Equation
Suppose that our system starts out in state , and changes, over some time (5 
minutes, say), into state . Of course, it could have started out in any of a multitude 
of differ entstates. So suppose it starts out in state , and changes over the 5 minute 
interval into state . We can schematically represent these two possible 
trajectories thus:

.
Since and are possible states of the system, so is their arbitrary linear
combination a+ b. What Schrodingers Equation tells us is that given that and 
would change in the ways just indicated, their linear combination must change in 
the following way:
a+ ba + b.
That fact turns out to make it surprisingly easy to analyze what look like complex 
experiments. Note that SE holds only if no measurement is taking place.</text>

NO!!! These tensor products work like multiplication:
xy + zw  (x+z)(y+w) .Note, however, that they do
distribute, so that
1/2 | up, 0&gt; | in R &gt; + 1/2 | down, 0&gt; | in R &gt;
can be rewritten as
1/2 (| up, 0&gt; +| down, 0 &gt; ) | in R &gt; =| up, 90&gt; | in R &gt;</text>

          <text>The statistical algorithm,
continued: Multiple outcomes
Weve dealt with an experiment with twooutcomes.
How about an experiment (measurement) with, say, 17 
outcomes?
Answer :
(1) We need a vector space with at least 17 dimensions.
(2) We need to choose, within it, a set of 17 pairwise-orthogonal axes.
(3) We need to associate one of the outcomes with each axis.
(4) We need to find a unit vector to represent the state of the system being 
measured.
Then we can apply the statistical algorithm in the same 
way that we did, in the case of spin measurements.</text>

          <text>Entangled states
Not all states of spin-1/2 partic les can be written in this way. 
Suppose that R and S are two distinct regions of space. Then 
| up, 0&gt; | in R &gt; 
is one possible state-vector for our particle; so is
| down, 0&gt; | in S &gt;.
The superposition principle tells us  that any linear combination
of two state-vectors is itself a state-vector. So
1/2 | up, 0&gt; | in R &gt; + 1/2 | down, 0&gt; | in S &gt;
is also a state-vector. You cannot rewrite this as a simple 
product of a spin part and a position part. Spin and 
position are entangled.</text>

Assume : Every orthonormal basis represents some possible 
experiment.
Then : for every state-vector V, there is some experiment Eand 
outcome such that if the system has state V, then Eis certain to 
produce . 
This fact gives us a handy way to write down the vector for a 
system: pick some such experiment  and outcome, and describe the 
state-vector by reference to them.
Ex: a spin-1/2 particle certain to go up through 0 is in state | up, 0 &gt; .

its position will, with certainty, reveal it to be in Ris in state | in R &gt; .</text>

If a measurement istaking placesay, of some system Sthen an entirely 
different story gets told about how the state of the system changes: during the 
measurement, the system S must jump (sometimes we say collapse) into a state 
that is certain to produce the observed result of the measurement . For example, 
suppose we have a particle in the state 
1/2| up, 0&gt; | in R &gt; + 1/2| down, 0&gt; | in S &gt; ,
and we look for it by placing a detector in region R. If we findit there (if our 
detector triggers , that is), then its state instantly changes to
| up, 0&gt; | in R &gt;.
On the other hand, if we dont find it there (our detector does not trigger), then its 
state instantly changes to 
| down, 0&gt; | in S &gt;.</text>

Suppose system Sis in a state represented by the unit vector V. 
Suppose experiment Eis performed on S, where Eis represented 
by the orthonormal basis {e1, e2,}, with vector ei
corresponding to outcome i .
To calculate Prob(outcome i) , calculate &lt;V | ei&gt;2.</text>

aspects of states
For the experiments we will analyz e, it is very convenient to 
keep separate track of those aspects of a particles state tha t 
have to do with its spini.e., that determine the probabilities 
that it will get deflected up or down through any given 
magnetfrom those having to do with its position (and 
momentum, although we wont care so much about that). To do 
this, we will represent its state, in the simplest case, by a 
product of vectors. For example,  if a particle is located in 
region of space R, and is cert ain to go up through a 0-magnet, 
we will write its state as | up, 0&gt; | in R &gt; .</text>

          <text>SOME HYPOTHETICAL 
PHYSICS
Bell-locality is violated in 
this example. Why?
Is our intuitive notion of 
locality (no action at a 
distance) violated?
Is special relativity 
violated?</text>

          <text>SOME HYPOTHETICAL 
PHYSICS
When the shock wave 
reaches a certain critical 
distance, two localized 
flashes appear on its 
surface, at opposite
positions , with their axis 
randomly determined :</text>
