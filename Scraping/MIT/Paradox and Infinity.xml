          <text>&#8226; MBB is impossible: 
&#8211; At Stage 3, it produces as long a sequence of ones as a machine 
with 2k states could possibly produce. 
&#8211; But (as noted above) MI = 2k. 
&#8211; So at Stage 3, it produces as long a sequence of ones as it itself 
could possibly produce. 
&#8211; So at Stage 4, it produces a longer string of ones than it itself 
could possibly produce. 
&#8226; So MH isn&#8217;t computable after all. 
3 The Universal Turing Machine 
There is a Universal Turing Machine , MU , which does the following: 
&#8226; if the mth Turing Machine halts given input n, leaving the tape in 
con&#64257;guration p, then MU halts given input hm, ni leaving the tape in 
con&#64257;guration p. 
&#8226; if the mth Turing Machine never halts given input n, then MU never 
halts given input hm, ni. 
4 The Fundamental Theorem 
The reason Turing Machines are so valuable is that it is possible to prove the 
following theorem: 
Fundamental Theorem of Turing Machines A function from natural num-
bers to natural numbers is Turing-computable if and only if it can be 
computed by an ordinary computer, assuming unlimited memory and 
running time. 
&#8226; One shows that every Turing-computable function is computable by 
an ordinary computer (given unlimited memory and running time) by 
showing that one can program an ordinary computer to simulate any 
given Turing Machine.

&#8226; Construct Turing Machine MI , which behaves as follows on an empty

Step 1: Print a sequence of k ones, for a certain k (speci&#64257;ed below). 
Result: k. 
Step 2: Duplicate your string of ones. 
Result: 2k. 
Step 3 Apply BB to your string of ones (using MBB). 
Result: BB(2k). 
Step 4 Add one to your string of ones. 
Result: BB(2k) + 1. 
&#8226; Let k = b + c + d 
b = the number of states used in Step 2 (to duplicate) 
c = the number of states used in Step 3 (to apply BB) 
d = the number of states used in Step 4 (to add one) 
Note: since a Turing Machine can output k using k states, 
MI = k + b + c + d = 2k

5 Church-Turing 
Computer scientists tend to think that something stronger than the Funda-
mental Theorem is true: 
Church-Turing Thesis A function is Turing-computable if and only if it 
can be computed algorithmically. 
For a problem to be solvable algorithmically is for it to be possible to 
specify a &#64257;nite list of instructions for solving the problem such that: 
1. Following the instructions is guaranteed to yield a solution to the prob-
lem, in a &#64257;nite amount of time. 
2. The instructions are speci&#64257;ed in such a way that carrying them out 
requires no ingenuity of any kind: they can be followed mechanistically. 
3. No special resources are required to carry out the instructions: they 
could in principle be carried out by a machine built from transistors. 
4. No special physical conditions are required for the computation to suc-
ceed (no need for faster-than-light travel, special solutions to Einstein&#8217;s 
equations, etc).

&#8226; We&#8217;ll focus on functions f : N &#8594; N. 
&#8226; For a computer program to compute f is for it to yield f(n) as output 
whenever it is given n as input (n &#8712; N).

(And I can give you examples!) 
2 How We&#8217;ll Get There 
&#8226; Turing Machines are computers of an especially simple sort. 
&#8226; We&#8217;ll see that some functions are not Turing-computable. 
&#8226; But: any function that can be computed using an ordinary computer 
is also computed by some Turing Machine.

A &#64257;nite list of command lines: 
hcurrent stateihcurrent symbolihnew symbolihdirection ihnew statei 
Think of a command line as encoding the following instruction: 
If you are in hcurrent statei and your reader sees hcurrent symboli 
written on the memory tape, replace hcurrent symboli with hnew symboli. 
Then move one step in direction hdirectioni, and go to hnew statei. 
Operation 
&#8226;Start out in state 0. Then carry out the following procedure, for as
long as you are able:
&#8211;Perform the instruction corresponding to the (&#64257;rst) command line
that matches your current state and the symbol on which your
reader is positioned.
&#8211;Repeat.
&#8226;If you are unable carry out the procedure, halt.

only a sequence of n ones (with the reader positioned at the left-most

1 if the nth Turning Machine halts when given input m;&#8226; H(n, m) = 0 otherwise. 
For instance: H(2310, 0) = 0 and H(2310, 2310) = 1. 
&#8226; H(n) = H(n, n) 
For instance: H(2310) = 1. 
6 H(n) is not Turing-computable 
&#8226; Assume for reductio : Turing Machine MH computes H(n). 
&#8226; Construct Turing Machine MI , which behaves as follows on input k: 
Step 1: Check whether H(k) (using MH ).( 
If H(k) = 1, go right forever. Step 2: If H(k) = 0, halt. 
&#8226; Informally: What happens when you run MI on input MI ? It &#64257;gures 
out whether it itself would halt on input MI . If the answer is yes, it 
goes o&#64256; on an in&#64257;nite task; if the answer is no, it immediately halts. 
&#8226; Formally: H(MI ) 1 or 0? 
&#8211; Suppose H(MI ) = 1. Then (by Step 2) MI goes right forever on 
input MI . So H(MI ) = 0. 
&#8211; Suppose H(MI ) = 0. Then (by Step 2) MI halts on input MI . 
So H(MI ) = 1. 
&#8226; So MI is impossible. So MH isn&#8217;t computable after all.

&#8211; We&#8217;ll assume that the tape is only unbounded on the right. 
&#8226; Turing Computabiity: 
&#8211; M computes a function f(x) if and only if it delivers f(n) as 
output whenever it is given n as input. 
&#8211; M takes n (n &#8712; N) as input if it starts out with a tape that 
contains only a sequence of n ones (with the reader positioned at

          <text>Standard Coin-Toss Procedure You toss a fair coin once for each natural 
number. Each time the coin lands Heads you write down a zero, and 
each time it lands Tails you write down a one. This gives you an in&#64257;nite 
binary sequence hd1, d2, d3, . . .i, Pick 0.d1d2d3 . . . (in binary notation).3 
&#8226; We get uniformity: 
0 1 
&#8226; Given certain assumptions about the probabilities of sequences of 
coin tosses, we get the Lebesgue Measure. 
Square Root Coin-Toss Procedure As before, but this time you pick &#8730; 0.d1d2d3 . . . (in binary notation). 
&#8226; We do not get uniformity:

4 Non-Measurable Sets 
&#8226; There are subsets of R that are non-measurable: 
they cannot be assigned a measure by any extension of &#955;, unless one 
gives up on one of Non-Negativity, Countable Additivity and Unifor-
mity. 
3Rational numbers have two di&#64256;erent binary expansions: one ending in 0s and the other 
ending in 1s. To simplify the present discussion, I assume that the Coin-Toss Procedure 
is rerun if the output corresponds to a binary expansion ending in 1s.

          <text>5 The Axiom of Choice 
It is impossible to prove that there are non-measurable sets without some 
version of the Axiom of Choice: 
Axiom of Choice Every set of non-empty, non-overlapping sets has a choice 
set. 
(A choice set for set A is a set that contains exactly one member from each 
member of A.)

          <text>Measure Theory 
1 Additive notions of size 
&#8226; the length of two (non-overlapping) line segments placed side by side 
is the length of the &#64257;rst plus the length of the second; 
&#8226; the mass of two (non-overlapping) objects taken together is the mass 
of the &#64257;rst plus the mass of the second. 
&#8226; The probability that either of two (incompatible) events occur is the 
probability that the &#64257;rst occur plus the probability that the second 
occur; 
The notion of measure is a very abstract way of thinking about additive 
notions of size. 
2 Generalizing the notion of length 
The standard notion of length: 
&#8226; [a, b] = {x &#8712; R : a &#8804; x &#8804; b} 
&#8226; Length([a, b]) = b &#8722; a. 
2.1 The Borel Sets 
A Borel Set is a set that you can get to by performing &#64257;nitely many ap-
plications of the operations of complementation and countable union on a 
family of line segments.1 
&#8226; The complementation operation takes each set A to its comple-
ment, A = R &#8722; A. 
&#8226; The countable union operation takes each countable family of setsS A1, A2, A3, . . . to their union, {A1, A2, A3 . . . }. 
1Formally, the Borel Sets are the members of the smallest set B such that: (i) every 
line segment is in B, (ii) if a set is in B, then so is its complement, and (iii) if a countable 
family of sets is in B, then so is its union.

7 Constructing the Ordinals 
Construction Principle At each stage, we introduce a new ordinal, namely: 
the set of all ordinals that have been introduced at previous stages. 
Open-Endedness Principle However many stages have occurred, there is 
always a &#8220;next&#8221; stage, that is, a &#64257;rst stage after every stage considered 
so far.&#8224; 
&#8224;It is important to interpret the Open-Endedness Principle as entailing that there is 
no such thing as &#8220;all&#8221; stages&#8212;and therefore deliver the result that there is no such thing 
as &#8220;all&#8221; ordinals.

          <text>The Ordinals 
1 How We&#8217;ll Get to the Ordinals 
Ordering &#8594; Total Ordering &#8594; Well-Ordering &#8594; Well-Order Type &#8594; Ordinal 
2 Orderings 
Think of x &lt; y as meaning &#8220;x precedes y&#8221;. We say that &lt; is an ordering 
on set A if and only if for any a, b, c &#8712; A: 
Asymmetry If a &lt; b , then not-(b &lt; a). 
Transitivity If a &lt; b and b &lt; c, then a &lt; c. 
3 Total Orderings 
A total ordering &lt; on A is an ordering on A such that for any distinct 
elements a, b of A: 
Totality a &lt; b or b &lt; a 
4 Well-Orderings 
A well-ordering &lt; of A is a total ordering on A such that: 
Well-Ordering Every non-empty subset S of A has a &lt;-smallest member. 
5 Well-order types 
The orderings &lt;1 and &lt;2 are of the same type if they are isomorphic.&#8727; 
&#8727;Let &lt;1 be an ordering on A and &lt;2 be an ordering on B. Then &lt;1 is isomorphic 
to &lt;2 if and only if there is a bijection f from A to B such that, for every x and y in A, 
x &lt; 1 y if and only if f(x) &lt;2 f(y).

          <text>Time Travel and Free Will 
1 The Grandfather Paradox 
Bruno travels back in time to kill Grandfather, who is yet to have any chil-
dren. He has a loaded gun at point-blank range. 
&#8226; If Bruno succeeds, Grandfather will never have any children. So Bruno 
will never be born, which contradicts the setup of the story. 
&#8226; If Bruno doesn&#8217;t succeed, what stops him? 
2 What Does the Paradox Show? 
Some possible answers: 
1. It shows that the concept of time travel is incoherent. 
2. It raises questions about whether the laws of physics could rule out 
paradoxical time travel in a principled way, without banning it alto-
gether. 
3. It shows that time travel is incompatible with free will. 
I think these answers are all mistaken! 
3 What is Free Will 
The following hypothesis is meant to capture the idea that someone who acts 
freely has control over the action she performs: 
Control Hypothesis An agent acts freely in doing X if and only if: (1) 
she does X by making a certain decision, and (2) she is in a position 
to do something other than X by making a di&#64256;erent decision. 
&#8226; The Control Hypothesis is actually incorrect. But it is a good starting 
point for elucidating the connection between time travel and free will, 
so we&#8217;ll treat it as our working hypothesis for now.

        <slide>
          <slideno>3</slideno>
          <text>&#8226; If Bruno had managed to aim just right, we would would have ended 
up in a situation that cannot be accounted for while keeping the rest 
of the story &#64257;xed. 
6 Why the Control Hypothesis is Incorrect 
&#8226; Suppose Susan freely decides to stay in New York. But had she at-
tempted to leave she would have been prevented from doing so. (Per-
haps she would have even been prevented from deciding to leave.) 
&#8226; Then Susan acts freely. But the Control Hypothesis entails (incor-
rectly) that she does not.

        <slide>
          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>&#8226; We&#8217;ll assume the Control Hypothesis, and consider a couple of argu-
ments purporting to show that Bruno fails to act freely because he was 
not in a position to make a di&#64256;erent decision about how to take his 
shot. 
4 First Argument 
Argument: We know that, on pain of contradiction, Bruno&#8217;s assassination 
attempt will fail. So Bruno isn&#8217;t free to pull the trigger. 
Reply: It is important to make the following distinction&#8212; 
&#8226; Whether we&#8212;who live in the present day&#8212;have information about 
Grandfather&#8217;s future that entails Bruno&#8217;s assassination attempt will 
fail. 
&#8226; Whether Bruno was in a position to kill Grandfather, regardless of 
whether we&#8212;who live in the present day&#8212;happen to know that things 
won&#8217;t actually turn out that way. 
5 Second Argument 
Argument: If Bruno were ever on track to kill Grandfather, the laws of 
physics would intervene to derail him. 
5.1 Determinism 
For a system of laws to be determinisitic is for it to entail, on the basis 
of a full speci&#64257;cation of the state of the world at any given time, a full 
speci&#64257;cation of the state of the world at any later time. 
&#8226; Note: Possessing free will is not simply a matter of having a decision-
making process that is not subject to deterministic laws.

          <text>&#8226; Note: There are two di&#64256;erent conceptions of physical law, 
1. The laws tell us what will happen, on the basis of what has hap-
pened. 
2. The laws tell us what must happen, on the basis of what has 
happened. 
time 
5.2 Back to the Argument 
&#8226; On the second conception of physical law&#8212;a law tells us what must 
happen, on the basis of what has happened&#8212;it is indeed the case that 
the laws make it impossible for Bruno to act otherwise. 
&#8226; On the &#64257;rst conception of physical law&#8212;a law tells us what will happen, 
on the basis of what has happened&#8212;the laws are silent on whether 
Bruno could have acted otherwise. 
(They are simply descriptions of the patterns that, as a matter of fact, 
characterize our world&#8217;s mosaic.) 
But, what would have happened if Bruno acted di&#64256;erently? 
&#8226; Don&#8217;t say that some additional defeater would have appeared and saved 
Grandfather. 
(That assumes that aiming just right would have caused the additional 
defeater to come about and we have been given no reason to think that 
such a causal structure is in place.)

          <text>Omega-sequence Paradoxes 
1 What is a Paradox? 
A paradox is an argument that appears to be valid, and goes from seemingly 
true premises to a seemingly false conclusion. So we must: 
&#8226; learn to live with the conclusion; 
&#8226; learn to live without one of the premises; or 
&#8226; show that the reasoning is invalid. 
An omega-sequence paradox is a paradox based on an &#969;-sequence (||| . . . ) 
or a reverse &#969;-sequence (. . . |||). 
2 Zeno&#8217;s Paradox1 [Paradox Grade: 2] 
You wish to walk from point A to point B. In order to do so, you 
must carry out an &#969;-sequence of tasks: 
Task 1: reach
Task 2: reach
Task 3: reach1 
2
3 
4
7 
8 mark 
mark mark 
... ... 
2
n&#8722;1Task n: reach mark2n 
7 
8 3 4 ... 
1 
2 ... 
A B 
. . . 
But it&#8217;s impossible to complete in&#64257;nitely many tasks in a &#64257;nite 
amount of time. So movement is impossible. 
1This is a variant of one of several paradoxes attributed to ancient philosopher Zeno 
of Elea, who lived in the 5th Century BC.

          <text>3 Thomson&#8217;s Lamp2 [Paradox Grade: 3] 
You have a lamp with a toggle button: press the button once and the lamp 
goes on, press it again and the lamp goes o&#64256;. Here&#8217;s what happens: 
Time to midnight Status of lamp shortly thereafter 
60s o&#64256; 
30s on 
15s o&#64256; 
7.5s on 
... ... 
60 s o&#64256; 22n 
60 s on 22n+1 
... ... 
Is the lamp on or o&#64256; at midnight? 
&#8226; For every time the lamp gets turned o&#64256; before midnight, there is a later 
time before midnight when it gets turned on. So the lamp can&#8217;t be 
o&#64256; at midnight. 
&#8226; For every time the lamp gets turned on before midnight, there is a later 
time before midnight when it gets turned o&#64256;. So the lamp can&#8217;t be 
on at midnight . 
4 The Demon&#8217;s Game3 [Paradox Grade: 4] 
P1, P2, P3, . . . take turns answering aye or nay: 
&#8226; If exactly n people say aye (n &#8712; N), each person gets $n. 
&#8226; If in&#64257;nitely many people say aye, they all get nothing. 
It seems rational for Pk to say aye: she can&#8217;t hurt anyone and might help 
everyone. But if it&#8217;s rational for Pk it&#8217;s rational for everyone. So nobody gets 
anything. 
2Thomson&#8217;s Lamp was devised by the late James Thomson, who was a professor of 
philosophy at MIT (and was married to the great philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson). 
3I learned about this paradox from philosophers Frank Arntzenius, Adam Elga, and 
John Hawthorne.

          <text>5 The Bomber&#8217;s Paradox4 [Paradox Grade: 6] 
There are in&#64257;nitely many bombs: 
Bomb When bomb is set to go o&#64256; 
B0 12:00pm 
B1 11:30am 
B2 11:15am 
... ... 
1 Bk hours after 11:00am 2k 
... ... 
Should one of the bombs go o&#64256;, it will instantaneously disable all other 
bombs. So a bomb goes o&#64256; if and only if no bombs have gone o&#64256; before it: 
(0) B0 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; 0). 
(1) B1 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; 1). 
(2) B2 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; 2). 
. . . 
(k) Bk goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; k ). 
(k + 1) Bk+1 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; k + 1). 
. . . 
Will any bombs go o&#64256;? 
4This paradox is due to Josh Parsons, who was a fellow at Oxford until shortly before 
his untimely death in 2017. (It is a version of Bernadete&#8217;s Paradox.)

          <text>Ordinals as Blueprints 
1 Ordinal Precedence v. Cardinal Precedence 
We have discussed two di&#64256;erent precedence relations, &lt;0 and &lt;: 
&#8226; &lt;o is the precedence relation for ordinals. 
&#945; &lt; o &#946; means that &#945; precedes &#946; in the hierarchy of ordinals. 
&#8226; &lt; is an ordering of set-cardinality. 
|A| &lt; |B| means that there is an injection from A to B (but no bijec-
tion). 
Important: &#945; &lt; o &#946; does not entail |&#945;| &lt; |&#946;|. 
2 Ordinals as Blueprints for Large Sets 
&#8226; An ordinal can be used as a &#8220;blueprint&#8221; for a sequence of applications 
of the power set and union operations. 
&#8226; The farther up an ordinal is in the hierarchy of ordinals, the longer the 
sequence, and the greater the cardinality of the end result. 
Speci&#64257;cally, each ordinal &#945; can be used to characterize the set B&#945;: 
&#9127; 
&#9130;N, if &#945; = 0 &#9128; 
B&#945; = &#8472;(B&#946; ), if &#945; = &#946;0 
&#9130;S&#9129; {B&#947; : &#947; &lt; o &#945;} if &#945; is a limit ordinal (other than 0) 
3 Later Ordinals, Bigger Cardinalities 
&#8226; By Cantor&#8217;s Theorem: if &#945; &lt; o &#946;, then |B&#945;| &lt; |B&#946; |. 
&#8226; For instance: 
&#969; &lt; o (&#969; &#215; &#969;) &lt;o &#969;&#969; &lt;o&#969;&#969;. So: |B&#969;| &lt; |B&#969;&#215;&#969;| &lt; |B&#969;&#969; | &lt; |B&#969; &#969;|.

          <text>4 Initial Ordinals 
&#8226; Initial ordinal: an ordinal that precedes all other ordinals of the same 
cardinality. 
&#8226; An initial ordinal &#954; can be used as proxy for its own cardinality: &#954; = |&#954;|. 
5 The Beth Hierarchy 
&#8226; i&#945; (read &#8220;beth-alpha&#8221;) is the initial ordinal of cardinality |B&#945;|. 
&#8226; So: i&#945; = |B&#945;|. 
&#8226; i0 = |N| and i00 = |&#8472;(N)| (so i00 is an uncountable ordinal). 
Since the beths are ordinals, they can be used to de&#64257;ne sets bigger than 
anything we&#8217;ve considered so far. For instance: 
&#8226; Bi00 (where i00 = |&#8472;(N)|) 
&#8226; Bii&#969; (where ii&#969; = |Bi&#969; |) 
6 The Continuum Hypothesis 
Continuum Hypothesis There is no set A such that i0 &lt; |A| &lt; i1. 
Generalized CH There is no set A such that i&#945; &lt; |A| &lt; i&#945;+1. 
7 The Burali-Forti Paradox 
Suppose, for reductio, that &#937; is the set of all ordinals. Then: 
&#8226; Since &#937; consists of every ordinal, it consists of every ordinal that&#8217;s been 
introduced so far. But a new ordinal is just the set every ordinal that&#8217;s 
been introduced so far. So: &#937; is an ordinal. 
&#8226; If &#937; was itself an ordinal, it would be a member of itself (and therefore 
have itself as a predecessor). But no ordinal can be its own predecessor. 
So: &#937; is not an ordinal. 
So there is no set of all ordinals!

          <text>Newcomb&#8217;s Problem 
1 The Problem 
There are two boxes. The transparent box contains $1K; you&#8217;re not sure what 
the opaque box contains but it&#8217;s either $0 or $1M. You have two choices: 
Two-Box Keep both boxes. 
One-Box Keep the large box; leave the small box behind. 
The boxes were sealed before you entered the room, and your choice will not 
cause their contents to change. How should you choose? 
2 A Predictor 
The contents of the box were selected by a predictor, who is known to be 
99% accurate: 
Prediction Opaque Box Transparent Box 
One-Box $1M $1K 
Two-Box $0 $1K 
As before, the boxes were sealed before you entered the room, and your choice 
will not cause their contents to change. How should you choose? 
&#8226; Wait! Could there even be such a predictor? 
3 A Case for One-Boxing 
&#8226; if you one-box, it is almost certain (99%) that the large box will contain 
a million dollars; 
&#8226; if you two-box, it is almost certain (99%) that the large box will be 
empty.

5 Decision Theory 
your options + your probabilities + your values &#8722;&#8594; a recommendation 
Expected Value Maximization Choose an option whose expected value 
is at least as high as that of any rival option. 
The expected value of an option A is the weighted average of the value of 
the outcomes that A might lead to, with weights determined by the proba-
bility of the relevant state of a&#64256;airs, given that you choose A. 
5.1 Formally Speaking. . . 
EV (A) = v(AS 1) &#183; p(S 1|A) + . . . + v(AS n) &#183; p(S n|A) 
&#8226; S1, S2, . . . S n is any list of (exhaustive and mutually exclusive) states of 
the world; 
&#8226; v(AS i) is the value of being in a situation in which you&#8217;ve chosen A 
and Si is the case; 
&#8226; p(S|A) is the probability of S, given that you choose A.

b W+ 
a c 
mirror A 
W-b 
space time 
Particle A is on a &#8220;paradoxical path&#8221;. It travels rightward, passes through 
spacetime point a and enters the wormhole at spacetime point b, jumping to 
the past. It exits the wormhole and continues its rightward trajectory until 
it reaches the mirror at spacetime point c. But what happens next? 
4.3 An answer to the toy paradox 
&#8226; One does not characterize a world by &#64257;rst deciding how many particles 
the world is to contain (and assigning them each a position and velocity 
at a time), and then using the dynamical laws to calculate the spacetime 
trajectories of these particles. 
&#8226; Instead, one characterizes a world by &#64257;rst drawing a family of spacetime 
trajectories that conform to the dynamical laws and then using the laws 
to determine how many particles the resulting world must contain. 
&#8226; So: it is a mistake to think that one can characterize a world by stipu-
lating that it is to contain a single particle traveling as in &#64257;gure ?? and 
then ask what happens when the dynamical laws are used to calculate 
the particle&#8217;s spacetime trajectory.

Law 1 In the absence of collisions, a particle&#8217;s velocity remains constant. 
Law 2 When two particles collide, they exchange velocities. (There are no 
collisions involving more than two particles.) 
4.1 Wormholes 
Our laws are consistent with wormholes. For instance: 
A 
W+ 
B 
B 
W-
A 
space time 
In this diagram, the points represented by W-are identi&#64257;ed with the points 
represented by W+. A jumps to the future when its spacetime trajectory 
reaches a point at which the wormhole is active; B jumps to the past when 
its spacetime trajectory reaches a spacetime point at which the wormhole is 
active. 
1The model is due to philosophers Frank Arntzenius and Tim Maudlin.

Figure 1: A change in George&#8217;s timeline. The straight lines represent events 
as they &#8220;originally&#8221; occurred. The jagged line represents events as they occur 
&#8220;after&#8221; the change. 
3 The Grandfather Paradox 
You travel back in time to kill your grandfather, who is yet to have any 
children. You have a loaded gun at point-blank range. 
&#8226; If you succeed, Grandfather will never have any children. So you&#8217;ll 
never be born, which contradicts the setup of the story. 
&#8226; If you don&#8217;t succeed, what stops you? 
Some reasons you might think the Grandfather Paradox is interesting: 
1. It shows that the concept of time travel is incoherent. 
2. It raises questions about whether the laws of physics could rule out 
paradoxical time travel in a principled way, without banning it alto-
gether. 
3. It shows that time travel is incompatible with free will. 
(For what it&#8217;s worth: I think these reasons are all mistaken.)

          <text>Time Travel 
1 Time Travel 
Our working de&#64257;nition: to travel in time is for there to be a discrepancy 
between: 
1. the start-time and end-time of one&#8217;s journey, and 
2. the duration of the journey from the perspective of one&#8217;s own perspec-
tive. 
2 Inconsistent Time Travel Stories 
For a time travel story to be consistent is for it to never make con&#64258;icting 
statements about what the world of the story is like at a given time. 
&#8226; For instance, Back to the Future is an inconsistent time travel story: 
What we&#8217;re told When we&#8217;re told 
In 1985, George is unhappy beginning of &#64257;lm 
In 1985, George is happy end of &#64257;lm 
2.1 Caveat: No &#8220;Changing Timeline&#8221; Stories 
&#8220;Changing Timeline&#8221; stories rely on two di&#64256;erent senses of time: 
1. an ordinary notion of time, which is used to describes changes within 
a given timeline; 
2. a non-ordinary sense of time, which is used to describe &#8220;changes&#8221; in 
the timeline itself. 
But: is the second sense really intelligible? 
2.2 Caveat: No World Travel Stories 
One can make some inconsistent time travel stories consistent by interpreting 
them as world travel stories. 
But: that just means that we&#8217;ve changed the subject.

2 Constructing the Ordinals 
Construction Principle At each stage, we introduce a new ordinal, namely: 
the set of all ordinals that have been introduced at previous stages. 
Open-Endedness Principle However many stages have occurred, there is 
always a &#8220;next&#8221; stage, that is, a &#64257;rst stage after every stage considered 
so far.1 
3 Ordering the Ordinals 
The ordinals are well-ordered by the following precedence relation: 
&#945; &lt; o &#946; &#8596;df &#945; &#8712; &#946; 
1It is important to interpret the Open-Endedness Principle as entailing that there is 
no such thing as &#8220;all&#8221; stages&#8212;and therefore deliver the result that there is no such thing 
as &#8220;all&#8221; ordinals.

          <text>4 Representing Well-Order Types 
Since every ordinal is a set of ordinals, the elements of an ordinal are always 
well-ordered by &lt;o. So we may set forth the following: 
Representation Principle Each ordinal represents the well-order type that 
it itself instantiates under &lt;o. 
5 Some De&#64257;nitions 
&#8226; &#945;0 = &#945; &#8746;{&#945;} 
&#8226; A successor ordinal is an ordinal &#945; such that &#945; = &#946;0 for some &#946;. 
&#8226; A limit ordinal is an ordinal that is not a successor ordinal. 
6 Ordinal Addition 
The intuitive idea: A well-ordering of type (&#945; + &#946;) is the result of starting 
with a well-ordering of type &#945; and appending a well-ordering of type &#946; at 
the end. 
Formally: 
&#945; + 0 = &#945; 
&#945; + &#946;0 = (&#945; + &#946;)0 
S &#945; + &#955; = {&#945; + &#946; : &#946; &lt; &#955;} (&#955; a limit ordinal) 
&#8226; Ordinal addition is associative: (&#945; + &#946;) + &#947; = &#945; + (&#946; + &#947;). 
&#8226; Ordinal addition is not commutative: it is not generally the case that 
&#945; + &#946; = &#946; + &#945;. 
7 Ordinal Multiplication 
The intuitive idea: A well-ordering of type (&#945; &#215; &#946;) is the result of starting 
with a well-ordering of type &#946; and replacing each position in the ordering 
with a well-ordering of type &#945;.

          <text>The Cantorian Theory of Size 
1 Basic De&#64257;nitions 
Cardinality |A| is the size of set A. 
Bijection Principle |A| = |B| i&#64256; there is a bijection from A to B. 
Injection Principle |A| &#8804; |B | i&#64256; there is an injection A to B. 
2 Extended De&#64257;nitions 
Notation How it&#8217;s de&#64257;ned Informal notion 
|A| = |B| bijection from A to B just as many members in A as in B 
|A| &#8804; |B | injection from A to B at most as many members in A as in B 
|A| &lt; |B||A| &#8804; |B| and |A| 6= |B| fewer members in A than in B 
|A| &#8805; |B | |B| &#8804; |A| at least as many members in A as in B 
|A| &gt; |B||A| &#8805; |B | and |A| 6= |B| more members in A than in B 
3 Properties of &#8804; 
Re&#64258;exivity |A| &#8804; |A| 
Anti-symmetry If |A| &#8804; |B | and |B| &#8804; |A|, then |A| = |B| 
Transitivity If |A| &#8804; |B | and |B| &#8804; |C|, then |A| &#8804; | C| 
Totality&#8727; For any sets A and B, either |A| &#8804; |B | or |B| &#8804; |A| 
&#8727;One can only prove Totality if one assumes a controversial set-theoretic axiom: the 
Axiom of Choice. We&#8217;ll come across this axiom again. Stay tuned! </text>

          <text>4.2 The Proof 
&#8226; Suppose otherwise: &#955;(C q) is well-de&#64257;ned for some q &#8712; Q[0,1). 
0 &#8712; Q[0,1)&#8226; By Uniformity, &#955;(Cq 0 ) = &#955;(C q) for any q . 
&#8226; By Non-Negativity, &#955;(C q) is either 0, or a positive real number, or &#8734;. 
&#8226; By Countable Additivity, it can&#8217;t be any of these: 
&#8211; Suppose &#955;(C q) = 0. By Countable Additivity: 
&#955;([0, 1)) = &#955;(C q) + &#955;(C q0 ) + . . . 
0 + 0 + 0 + . . .= | {z } 
once for each integer 
= 0 
&#8211; Suppose &#955;(C q) = r &gt; 0. By Countable Additivity: 
&#955;([0, 1)) = &#955;(C q) + &#955;(C q0 ) + . . . 
r + r + r + . . .= | {z } 
once for each integer 
= &#8734; 
Moral: There is no way of assigning a measure to a Vitali set without giving 
up on Uniformity, Non-Negativity or Countable Additivity. 
5 Revising Our Assumptions? 
&#8226; Giving up on Uniformity means changing the subject : the whole point 
of our enterprise is to &#64257;nd a way of extending the notion of Lebesgue 
Measure without giving up on uniformity. 
&#8226; Non-Negativity and Countable Additivity are not actually needed 
to prove the existence of non-measurable sets. 
&#8226; Some mathematical theories would be seriously weakened by giving up 
on the Axiom of Choice.

          <text>The Vitali Sets 
1 Non-Measurable Sets 
&#8226; There are subsets of R that are non-measurable: 
They cannot be assigned a measure by any extension of &#955;, without 
giving up on Non-Negativity, Countable Additivity, or Uniformity. 
2 The Axiom of Choice 
Proving that there are non-measurable sets requires: 
Axiom of Choice Every set of non-empty, non-overlapping sets has a choice 
set. 
(A choice set for set A is a set that contains exactly one member from each 
member of A.) 
3 De&#64257;ning the Vitali Sets 
3.1 A sketch of the construction 
&#8226; De&#64257;ne an (uncountable) partition U of [0, 1). 
&#8226; Use the Axiom of Choice to pick a representative from each cell of U. 
&#8226; Use these representatives to de&#64257;ne a (countable) partition C of [0, 1). 
&#8226; A Vitali Set is a cell of C. 
3.2 De&#64257;ning U 
a, b &#8712; [0, 1) are in the same cell if and only if a &#8722; b &#8712; Q.

L counts as &#8220;rich enough&#8221; if one can prove: 
Lemma L contains a formula (abbreviated &#8220;Halt( k)&#8221;), which is true if and 
only if the kth Turing Machine halts on input k. 
(As it turns out, even our simple language L satis&#64257;es this condition!) 
5 A Proof of G&#168; odel&#8217;s Theorem (V1) 
&#8226; Assume for reductio : M decides the truth of sentences of L. 
&#8226; By the Lemma, we can use M &#8217;s program to construct a Turing Machine 
MH , which computes the Halting Function. 
&#8226; Since the Halting Function is not Turing-computable, our assumption 
must be false. 
We&#8217;ve proved G&#168; odel&#8217;s Thoerem!

1 The Theorem 
Let L be a (rich enough) arithmetical language: 
G&#168; odel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorem (V1) No Turing Machine can do the 
following: when given a sentence of L as input, it outputs &#8220;1&#8221; if the 
sentence is true and &#8220;0&#8221; if the sentence is false. 
G&#168; odel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorem (V2) No Turing Machine can: 
1. run forever, outputting sentences of L; 
2. eventually output each true sentence of L; and 
3. never output a false sentence of L. 
G&#168; odel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorem (V3) No axiomatization of L is both 
consistent and complete. 
2 What the Theorem Teaches Us 
&#8226; Mathematically: 
Arithmetical truth is too complex to be &#64257;nitely speci&#64257;able. 
&#8226; Philosophically: Interesting mathematical theories can never be established beyond any 
possibility of doubt. 
3 A Simple Arithmetical Language, L 
&#8226; An arithmetical language is a language to talk about the natural 
numbers and their basic operations (e.g. addition and multiplication). 
&#8226; L is an arithmetical language built from the following symbols:1 
1With some e&#64256;ort, the exponentiation symbol can be de&#64257;ned using &#8220;+&#8221; and &#8220;&#215;&#8221;, as 
G&#168; odel showed. I include it here because it will make proving the theorem much easier.

3. Bayes&#8217; Law; 
4. the Principle of Indi&#64256;erence. 
3.1 Internal Coherence 
For a credence function to be internally coherent is for it to constitute a 
probability function. 
A probability function, p(. . .), is an assignment of real numbers between 
0 and 1 to propositions that satis&#64257;es the following two coherence conditions: 
Necessity p(A) = 1 whenever A is a necessary truth 
Additivity p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B) whenever A and B are incompatible 
propositions 
3.2 Update by Conditionalization 
If S is rational, she will update here credences as follows upon learning 
that B: 
new(A) = p old(A|B ) p 
where pold is the function describing S&#8217;s credences before she learned 
that B, and pnew is the function describing her credences after she 
learned that B. 
3.3 Bayes&#8217; Law 
p(AB ) = p(A) &#183; p(B|A) 
3.4 The Principle of Indi&#64256;erence 
Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;d like to have in place: 
Principle of Indi&#64256;erence Consider a set of propositions and suppose one 
knows that exactly one of them is true. Suppose, moreover, that one 
has no more reason to believe any one of them than any other. Then, 
insofar as one is rational, one should assign equal credence to each 
proposition in the set.

          <text>Probability, Subjective and Objective 
1 Two Kinds of Probability 
Subjective Probability A person&#8217;s subjective probability in p is the degree 
to which she is con&#64257;dent in p. 
Example: Jones&#8217;s subjective probability that it&#8217;ll rain tomorrow is 0.3 
because she is 30% con&#64257;dent that it&#8217;ll rain tomorrow. 
Objective Probability The objective probability of an event is meant to 
be a feature of the world that does not depend on the beliefs of any 
particular subject. 
Example: the objective probability that a particle of 256Sg will decay 
in the next 8.9 seconds is 50%. 
2 How are they related? 
The Objective-Subjective Connection The objective probability of A 
at time t is the subjective probability that a perfectly rational agent 
would assign to A, if she had perfect information about the world at 
times &#8804; t and no information about the world at times &gt; t. 1 
3 Subjective Probability 
A credence function for subject S is a function that assigns to each propo-
sition a real number between 0 and 1, representing S&#8217;s degree of con&#64257;ndence 
in that proposition 
What does it take for a credence function to be rational? 
1. internal coherence; 
1Here I am tacitly presupposing that a perfectly rational agent is always certain about 
the objective probabilities at t, given full information about how the world is before t. So, 
in particular, for each complete history of the world up to t, Ht, there is a speci&#64257;cation Pt 
of the objective probabilities at t such that the agent treats Ht and HtPt as equivalent. 
(This assumption is potentially controversial but adds simplicity to our discussion.)

4 Objective Probability 
By the Objective-Subjective Connection, our conclusions about rational sub-
jective probability deliver tell us that the objective probabilities: 
1. constitute a probability function; 
2. update by an analogue of conditionalization; 
3. satisfy Bayes&#8217; Law; 
4. [satisfy a Principle of Indi&#64256;erence?].

          <text>8 G&#168; odel&#8217;s Theorem (v3) 
8.1 Axiomatization 
&#8226; An axiom is a sentence that is taken to require no proof. 
&#8226; A rule of inference is a rule for inferring some sentences from others. 
&#8226; An axiomatization for L is a (Turing Computable) list of axioms and 
rules of inference for L. 
8.2 Provability, completeness and consistency 
For A an axiomatization of L: 
&#8226; A sentence S of L is provable in A if there is a &#64257;nite sequence of 
sentences of L such that: 
&#8211; Every member of the sequence is either an axiom of A, or re-
sults from previous members of the sequence by applying a rule 
of inference of A. 
&#8211; The last member of the sequence is S. 
&#8226; A is complete if every true sentence of L is provable in A. 
&#8226; A consistent if it is never the case that both a sentence of L and its 
negation are provable in A. 
8.3 Proving the Theorem 
&#8226; For reductio : A is a consistent and complete axiomatization of L. 
&#8226; Since L can talk about &#64257;nite sequences, it can talk about sentences 
(i.e. &#64257;nite sequences of symbols) and proof (which are &#64257;nite sequences 
of sentences). 
&#8226; One can program a Turing Machine M to output all and only the 
sentences of L that are provable in A. 
&#8226; If A is consistent and complete, M outputs all and only the true sen-
tences of L, which contradicts G&#168; odel&#8217;s Theorem (v2).

1 The Theorem 
Let L be a (rich enough) arithmetical language: 
G&#168; odel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorem (V1) No Turing Machine can do the 
following: when given a sentence of L as input, it outputs &#8220;1&#8221; if the 
sentence is true and &#8220;0&#8221; if the sentence is false.

1. run forever, outputting sentences of L;

3. never output a false sentence of L. 
G&#168; odel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorem (V3) No axiomatization of L is both 
consistent and complete. 
2 The Crucial Lemma 
L counts as &#8220;rich enough&#8221; if one can prove: 
Lemma L contains a formula (abbreviated &#8220;Halt( k)&#8221;), which is true if and 
only if the kth Turing Machine halts on input k. 
Today we&#8217;ll verify that our simple language L satis&#64257;es this condition.

          <text>5 The key idea 
&#8226; The key is to be able to express claims about sequences in L. 
&#8226; We need a formula&#8212;abbreviated &#8220;Seq(c, n, a, i)&#8221;&#8212; which is true if and 
only if c encodes a sequence of length n of which a is the ith member. 
&#8226; With that in place, proving the lemma is totally straightforward.

where pi =6 pj whenever i =6 j and ei =6 0. 
&#8226; We say that c&#8217;s non-trivial exponents are e0, e1, . . . , e k. 
&#8226; Each number can be thought of a code for the set of its non-trivial 
exponents.

secting its axis of rotation. 
&#8226; So whenever c is such that some such problem point is the endpoint 
of some Cayley Path, we will have di&#64256;erent Cayley Paths sharing an 
endpoint. 
The good news: 
&#8226; There are only countably many problem points. 
&#8226; One can deal with these points separately, by applying a sophisticated 
version of the trick we used in Warm-Up Case 2. 
8 Duplicating the Ball 
&#8226; Use the same procedure as before, but rather than working with points 
on the surface of the ball, work with the lines that connect the center 
of the ball with each point. 
&#8226; Wait! What about the center of the ball? 
9 A region with no volume 
Some of the Banach-Tarski pieces must be non-measurable must therefore 
lack de&#64257;nite volumes!

          <text>3 An external coordinate system 
&#8226; The x-axis runs from your right to your left through the center of the 
ball. 
&#8226; The y-axis runs is orthogonal to the x-axis. It runs from the wall in 
front of you to the wall in behind of you, through the center of the ball. 
&#8226; The the z-axis is orthogonal to the other two. It runs from the ground 
to the sky, through the center of the ball. 
4 A spherical interpretation of the Graph 
&#8226; The &#8220;center&#8221; of our graph is interpreted as an arbitrary point c on the 
surface of our ball. 
&#8226; A &#8220;step&#8221; is interpreted as the result of performing a rotation on the 
sphere, by a certain angle &#952;: 
&#8211; An &#8220;up&#8221; rotation is a counterclockwise rotation of &#952; degrees about 
the x axis. (When you&#8217;re holding the ball in front of you, you 
perform this rotation by rotating the ball from bottom to top.) 
&#8211; A &#8220;down&#8221; rotation is a clockwise rotation of &#952; degrees about the 
x axis. (When you&#8217;re holding the ball in front of you, you perform 
this rotation by rotating the ball from top to bottom.) 
&#8211; A &#8220;right&#8221; rotation is a counterclockwise rotation of &#952; degrees 
about the z axis. (When you&#8217;re holding the ball in front of you, 
you perform this rotation by rotating the ball from left to right.) 
&#8211; A &#8220;left&#8221; rotation is a clockwise rotation of &#952; degrees about the z 
axis. (When you&#8217;re holding the ball in front of you, you perform 
this rotation by rotating the ball from right to left.) 
5 The endpoints of Cayley Paths 
&#8226; To each rotation &#961; corresponds a function f&#961;, which takes each point p 
on the surface of the ball to the point on the surface of the ball whose 
current location (relative to an external reference frame) would come 
to be occupied by p were rotation &#961; to be performed.

          <text>4 The Two-Envelope Paradox 
&#8226; Two envelopes: 
&#8211; one contains $n, for n chosen at random from Z+ . 
&#8211; the other contains 2n. 
&#8226; You are handed one of the envelopes, but don&#8217;t know which. 
&#8226; Then you are o&#64256;ered the chance to switch. Should you switch? 
An argument for switching: 
Say that your envelope contains $k. If k is odd, you should switch. 
If k is even, there&#8217;s a 0.5 chance that the other envelope has $2k 
and a 0.5 chance that the other envelope has $k/2. So: 
EV (switch) = $k/2 &#183; 0.5 + $2k &#183; 0.5 = 5 /4 &#183; $k 
EV (not switch) = $k 
5 Broome&#8217;s Variant of the Paradox 
&#8226; Two envelopes: 
&#8211; Toss a die until it lands One or Two. If the die &#64257;rst lands One or 
Two on the kth toss, place 2k&#8722;1 in the &#64257;rst envelope. 
&#8211; Place twice that amount in the other envelope.

          <text>2.1 In&#64257;nitesimals to the rescue? 
What if we had an in&#64257;nitesimal value &#953; with the following property? 
&#953; + &#953; + &#953; + . . . = 1| {z } 
once for each positive integer 
Then: 
p(G 1 or G3 or G5 or . . .) = p(G 1) + p(G 3) + p(G 5) + . . . 
&#953; + &#953; + &#953; + . . .= | {z } 
once for each positive integer 
= 1 
and 
p(G 2 or G4 or G6 or . . .) = p(G 2) + p(G 4) + p(G 6) + . . . 
&#953; + &#953; + &#953; + . . .= | {z } 
once for each positive integer 
= 1 
So, by (&#64257;nite) Additivity: 
p(G 1 or G2 or G3 or . . .) = 2 (!) 
3 For Countable Additivity 
&#8226; X, Y &#8838; Z+ 
&#8226; p(X) is the probability that God selects a number in X. 
&#8226; p(X|Y ) is the probability that God selects a number in X given that 
She selects a number in Y . 
Here is a natural way of characterizing p(X) and p(X|Y ): 
|X &#8745; Y &#8745;{1, 2, . . . , n}|p(X|Y ) = d f lim 
n&#8594;&#8734; |Y &#8745;{1, 2, . . . , n}| 
p(X) = d f p(X|Z+)

          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>&#8226; p(X) is &#64257;nitely additive but not countably additive. 
&#8226; p(X) is not well-de&#64257;ned for arbitrary sets of integers.1 
Also, there is a set S and a partition Ei of Z+ such that: 
&#8226; p(S) = 0 
&#8226; p(S|Ei) &#8805; 1/2 for each Ei. 
Example: 
S = {12 , 22 , 32 , . . . }; Ei be the set of powers of i (whenever i 
which is not a power of any other positive integer). In other 
words: 
S 
E1 
E2 
E3 
[No E4, since 4 = 22] = 
= = = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . }
{1}
{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . . }
{3, 9, 27, 81, 243, . . . } 
E
5 = 
. {5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, . . . } 
. . 
3.1 Is this really so bad? 
Yes. There is a sequence of bets BE1 , BE2 , BE3 , BE5 , . . . such that: 
&#8226; you are con&#64257;dent that you ought to take each of the bets, 
&#8226; you are 100% con&#64257;dent that you will lose money if she takes them all. 
BEi : Suppose God selects a number in Ei. Then you&#8217;ll receive $2 if the 
selected number is in S and you&#8217;ll be forced to pay $1 if the selected 
number is not in S. (If the selected number is not in Ei, then the bet 
is called o&#64256; and no money exchanges hands.) 
Problems of this general form are inescapable: they will occur whenever a 
probability function on a countable set of possibilities fails to be countably 
additive. 
&#8804; k &lt; 2m+1 1For instance, when X consists of the integers k such that 2m , for some 
even m.

          <text>Countable Additivity 
1 The Principle of Countable Additivity 
(Finite) Additivity p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B) 
whenever A and B are incompatible propositions 
Countable Additivity p (A1 or A2 or . . .) = p(A 1) + p(A 2) + . . . 
whenever A1, A2, . . . are countably many propositions with Ai and Aj 
incompatible for i 6= j. 
2 Against Countable Additivity 
&#8226; God has selected a positive integer, and that you have no idea which. 
&#8226; For n a positive integer, what credence should you assign to the propo-
sition, Gn, that God selected n? 
Countable Additivity entails that your credences should remain unde&#64257;ned 
(unless you&#8217;re prepared to give di&#64256;erent answers for di&#64256;erent choices of n). 
Proof: suppose otherwise. Then p(Gn) = r, for r &#8712; [0, 1]. 
&#8226; Suppose r = 0. By Countable Additivity: 
p(G 1 or G2 or G3 or . . .) = p(G 1) + p(G 2) + p(G 3) + . . . 
0 + 0 + 0 + . . .= | {z } 
once for each integer 
= 0 
&#8226; Suppose r &gt; 0. By Countable Additivity: 
p(G 1 or G2 or G3 or . . .) = p(G 1) + p(G 2) + p(G 3) + . . . 
r + r + r + . . .= | {z } 
once for each integer 
= &#8734; 
Moral: Countable Additivity entails that there is no way of distributing 
probability uniformly across a countably in&#64257;nite set of (mutually exclusive 
and jointly exhaustive) propositions.

1 The Theorem 
Banach-Tarski Theorem It is possible to decompose a ball into a &#64257;nite 
number of pieces and reassemble the pieces (without changing their size 
or shape) so as to get two balls, each of the same size as the original. 
1.1 Warm-Up Case 1: A Line 
It is possible to decompose [0, &#8734;) &#8722;{1} into two distinct parts, 
and reassemble the parts (without changing their size or shape) 
so as to get back [0, &#8734;). 
1 
&#8226; Decompose [0, &#8734;) &#8722;{1} into: (i) {2, 3, 4, . . . } and (ii) everything else. 
&#8226; Translate {2, 3, 4, . . . } one unit to the left. 
1.2 Warm-Up Case 2: A Circle 
It is possible to decompose S1 &#8722;{p} into two distinct parts, and 
reassemble the parts (without changing their size or shape) so as 
to get back S1 . 
p S1 
&#8226; Decompose S1 &#8722;{p} into: (i) B and (ii) everything else. 
&#8226; Rotate B one unit counter-clockwise.

          <text>&#8226; Each person as assigned a red or blue hat, based on the outcome of a 
coin toss. 
&#8226; Everyone can see the hats of people in front of her, but cannot see her 
own hat (or the hat of anyone behind her). 
&#8226; At a set time, everyone has to guess the color of her own hat by crying 
out &#8220;Red!&#8221; or &#8220;Blue!&#8221;. 
&#8226; People who correctly call out the color of their own hats will be spared. 
Everyone else will be shot. 
Problem: Find a strategy that P1, P2, P3, . . . could agree upon in advance 
and that would guarantee that at most &#64257;nitely many people are shot. 
4 The Three Prisoners4 [Paradox Grade: 2] 
&#8226; Three prisoners. Each of them is assigned a red or blue hat, based on 
the outcome of a coin toss. 
&#8226; Each of them can see the colors of the others&#8217; hats but has no idea 
about the color of his own hat. 
&#8226; The prisoners are then taken into separate cells and asked about the 
color of their hat. They are free to o&#64256;er an answer or remain silent. 
&#8211; If all three prisoners remain silent, all three will be killed. 
&#8211; If one of them answers incorrectly, all three will be killed. 
&#8211; If at least one prisoner o&#64256;ers an answer, and everyone who o&#64256;ers 
an answer answers correctly, then all three prisoners will be set 
free. 
Problem: Find a strategy that the prisoners could agree upon ahead of time 
which would guarantee that their chance of survival is above 50%. 
4I don&#8217;t know who invented it, but I learned about it thanks to philosopher and 
computer scientist Rohit Parikh, from the City University of New York.

1 The Bomber&#8217;s Paradox1 [Paradox Grade: 6] 
There are in&#64257;nitely many bombs: 
Bomb When bomb is set to go o&#64256; 
B0 12:00pm 
B1 11:30am 
B2 11:15am 
... ... 
1 Bk hours after 11:00am 2k 
... ... 
Should one of the bombs go o&#64256;, it will instantaneously disable all other 
bombs. So a bomb goes o&#64256; if and only if no bombs have gone o&#64256; before it: 
(0) B0 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; 0). 
(1) B1 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; 1). 
(2) B2 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; 2). 
. . . 
(k) Bk goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; k ). 
(k + 1) Bk+1 goes o&#64256; &#8596; Bn fails to go o&#64256; (n &gt; k + 1). 
. . . 
Will any bombs go o&#64256;? 
1This paradox is due to Josh Parsons, who was a fellow at Oxford until shortly before 
his untimely death in 2017. (It is a version of Bernadete&#8217;s Paradox.)

          <text>2 Yablo&#8217;s Paradox2 [Paradox Grade: 8] 
There are in&#64257;nitely many sentences: 
Label Sentence 
S0 &#8220;For each i &gt; 0, sentence Si is false&#8221; 
S1 &#8220;For each i &gt; 1, sentence Si is false&#8221; 
S2 &#8220;For each i &gt; 2, sentence Si is false&#8221; 
... ... 
Sk &#8220;For each i &gt; k , sentence Si is false&#8221; 
... ... 
The meanings of our sentences guarantee that each of the following must be 
true: 
(0) S0 is true &#8596; Sn is false (n &gt; 0). 
(1) S1 is true &#8596; Sn is false (n &gt; 1). 
(2) S2 is true &#8596; Sn is false (n &gt; 2). 
. . . 
(k) Sk is true &#8596; Sn is false (n &gt; k ). 
(k + 1) Sk+1 is true &#8596; Sn is false (n &gt; k + 1). 
. . . 
Which sentences are true and which ones are false? 
3 Bacon&#8217;s Problem3 [Paradox Grade: 7] 
&#8226; An omega sequence of prisoners: P1, P2, P3, . . .. ( P1 is at the end of the 
line, in front of her is P2, in front of him is P3, and so forth.) 
2This paradox was discovered by Steve Yablo, who is a famous philosophy professor 
at MIT (and was a member of my dissertation committee, many years ago). 
3This paradox is due to USC philosopher Andrew Bacon.
