be recorded by seismometers when the wave speed increases again.
The corresponding waves arrive signicantly farther away from thesource than the ones with only a slightly less ray parameter. (You
can also say that here we have a situation where p0 but /negationslash=0
so that the amplitude is zero.) Initially, some rays may reect at the
top of the base of the low velocity zone so that energy is projected
to shorter distances with a further decrease in ray parameter (inci-dence angle), but eventually, the eect of the low wave speed zone
is no longer felt and the rays sample deeper regions and behave in a
manner similar to the general situation.
In terms of ray geometry : there will be a region in the Earths interior
that is not sampled.
T() : The travel time curve will reveal a shadow zone , a region
where (according to our simplied  ray  theory based on the high
frequency approximation) no phases arrive. There will be a small
distance where two phases can arrive : the wave reected from the
base of the low velocity zone and the direct arrival which is the wave
that turns beneath the LVZ.
p() : Initially, pwill decrease with increasing distance ( p/&lt;0),
andp() is continuous. When pdecreases so that the ray is refracted
through the LVZ two things happen :
(a) the p() curve is no longer continuous since the ray dened by
the incrementally smaller parrives at a dierent distance, and
(b) with decreasing pthe distance initially decreases because of the
reection ( p/&gt;0). If pdecreases even further the normal
behavior is established again ( p/&lt;0).
Amplitude : The amplitude is zero in the shadow zone (the p
 curve is horizontal), but becomes large for arrivals at a distance
just outside the shadow zone corresponding to rays that bottom just
beneath the LVZ (the p curve is vertical).
The two most important regions in the Earth where this happens are the
low velocity layer beneath oceanic lithosphere and at the transition from
the mantle to the outer core (for P-waves).

4.16 Travel time curves and radial Earth struc-
ture
We have been developing some basic theory and concepts of body wave seis-
mology. One of the major objectives of seismology is to extract structural
information about Earths structure from the observed data, the seismograms.
We will discuss some rather classical techniques to do this.
Snells Law
We derived Snells law for a at Earth :
sini1
c1=sini2
c2=...=sinin
cn= constant p, the ray parameter
 (4.96)
The ray parameter is constant along the entire ray path, and is the same for
all rays (reections, refractions, conversions) associated with the same incomingray. The ray parameter plays a very important role in seismology.
Snells Law shows that the ray parameter is inversely proportional to velocity,
or proportional to 1/velocity, which is the slowness . In seismology it is often
more convenient to use slowness instead of wave speed . One signicant advantage
of the slowness vector is that it can be added vectorially, whereas this is not
always justied (in our context) for the velocity.
s=(s
1,s2,s3)=s1x1+s2x2+s3x3 (4.97)
The vector summation for velocity can give practical problems : consider,
for instance, the plane wave that propagates in the direction k. The apparent
velocity c1measured at the surface (from observations at several stations) is
larger than the true velocity c:w i t h ithe angle of incidence, c1=c/sini&gt;c,
so that c/negationslash=c1+c3.
From Fig. 4.11 we can easily derive two other important relationships :
sini=ds
dx1=cdt
dx1=c
c1
p=sini
c=dt
dx1=1

= 1, 2, ... are the over tones.
Power spectrum
The individual modes can, in general, not be observed directly from the seis-
mograms. Free oscillations are studied with spectral techniques. If one was to
take a Fourier transform of a suciently long record of ground motion, typically
many hours or even days, one gets a power spectrum that reveals the distinct
eigenfrequencies of the Earths free oscillations (see Fig. 4.30).
Nomenclature of normal modes
Normal modes of free oscillation are just the solutions of the wave equation in
a spherical coordinate system and the nomenclature of the modes is therefore
based on spherical harmonics. Recall that the gravity and magnetic poten-tials were, in fact, summations of modes with dierent coecients (Gaussian
coecients in the case of the magnetic potential). The expression of mode sum-
mation is similar to the spherical harmonic expressions used when we discussed,for instance, the geoid and the magnetic eld with two dierences: (1) the nor-
malization of the harmonic coecients are typically specic to each application
(seismology, gravity, geomagnetism), but dont worry about that now, and (2)
instead of doing the summation from m=0t o lwith two (Gaussian) coe-Figure by MIT OCW.L

contains structural information about the radial variation of seismic properties.
A plot of the group or phase velocity as a function of frequency is called a
dispersion curve . Their diagnostic value of 1D structure has been explored in
great detail. Typically, the curves produced from observed records are matched
with standard curves computed from an assumed reference Earth model that canhave a structure that is characteristic for a certain type of upper mantle (e.g.,
old/young continents, old/young oceans, etc.). Such analyses have produced the
rst maps of the thickness of oceanic lithosphere which revealed the increase inthickness with increasing age of the lithosphere (or distance from the ridge),
and also underlie the discovery of the Low Velocity Zone (LVZ) at a depth of
about 100 to 200 km beneath most oceans and beneath the younger parts of
continents. Fig. 4.27 shows a variety of typical dispersion curves for dierent
tectonic provinces.

Like any bounded medium, the Earth can ring like a bell and after occur-rence of a big earthquake it can oscillate in normal modes with discrete
(eigen)frequencies. Normal modes of the Earth were predicted to exist in the</text>

4.14 Fermats Principle and Snells law
An important principle in optics is Fermats principle, which governs the geom-
etry of ray paths. This principle states that a wave propagating from position
Ato position Bfollows a path of stationary time . The principle of stationary
time plays a fundamental role in high frequency seismology. Note that station-ary time does not necessarily mean minimum time; it can also be a maximum
time.
Figure 4.9: The principle of stationary time.
Consider Fig. 4.9. A ray leaves point Pthat is in a medium with wave
speed c1and travels to point Qin a medium with wave speed c2.W h a t p a t h
will the ray take to Q? Since the wave speeds in the media are constant the ray
path in each medium is a straight line, so that in this simple case the geometry
is completely dened by the positions of P,Q,a n dt h ep o i n t xwhere the ray
crosses the interface.

4.7 From vector to scalar potentials  Polariza-
tion
Using the Fourier transform, we show that the vector decomposition with 
andcan be reduced into three equations with the scalar potentials ,  SV
and  SH(waves are typically described by oscillatory functions, i.e. complex
exponentials. It is therefore natural to move the analysis to the frequencydomain, i.e. to use Fourier transforms). We will write u(r,t)f o rt h et i m e
and space domain displacement, and u(r,) for the displacement in space and
frequency. The transformation to the frequency domain is done by means of the
(temporal) Fourier transform, which is dened as :
u(r,)=/integraldisplay
u(r,t)eitdt (4.48)
u(r,t)=1
2+/integraldisplay
u(r,)eitd (4.49)
It is easy to see how the time derivative in a partial dierential equation (PDE)
brings out a factor of i. This can be veried using the PDE obtained in section
4.6 :
2u
t2=(+2)(u)(u) (4.50)
The separation of the equation of motion into two parts was done in section
4.6. It can also be done in the frequency domain : using Eq. 4.49 and Eq. 4.38,Eq. 4.50 (the equation of motion) becomes :

2= 2u (4.51)
2=2u (4.52)

at the same time at a receiver at some distance from the source. But if, as is
the case in Earth, the PandS-wave speed changes with depth, the longer
period waves arrive at a dierent time than the shorter period waves. In Earth,
the propagation speed of Rayleigh waves is thus frequency-dependent, and the
waveform changes with increasing or decreasing distance from the source. This
frequency dependence of propagation speed is called dispersion . Love waves are
always dispersive since they cannot exist unless there is a layer over a half space,with the shear wave speed in the half space larger than in the overlying layer.
As a result of dispersion the surface waveform changes with varying distance
from the source, and it is clear that one can no longer describe the wave propaga-
tion with a single wave speed. We describe the propagation velocity of the part
of the waveform that remains constant, such as the onset of the phase arrrival,a peak, or a trough (see discussion of plane waves) with the phase velocity
c=/k. Wave packages with dierent frequencies travel at dierent velocities
and their interference results in a phenomenon known as beating (see Interm):
the propagation velocity of the envelope, which is related to the energy, of the
resulting wave train is called the group velocity U .
Peaks or troughs in the wave form, or the onset of a particular phase arrival
in the seismogram, all propagate with the phase velocity .I n f a c t , w e h a v e
seen this before when we discussed travel time curves of the body waves, which
depend on the phase velocity. The phase velocity can thus be measured directly
from travel time curves (recall that the horizontal slowness pcan be determined
from the slope of the travel time curve at a certain distance).
In Fig. 4.25 the dashed lines through A,B, etc. are travel time curves for
those phases. But note that the frequency of those phases change with distance,
so that the waveform changes. For instance, with increasing distance, the rst
arriving phase ( A) is composed of waves with larger frequencies (because they
sample deeper).
Thegroup velocity is constant for a given frequency ( d=0 ) . T h u s
the group velocity of surface waves of a particular frequency denes a straight
line through the origin and through the signal of that particular frequency on
records of ground motion at dierent distances. The group velocity decreasesas the frequency increases. As a result, high frequency phases become less
and less pronounced with increasing distance from the source (or time in the
seismogram).
The group velocity is very important: the energy in surface waves propagates
mainly in the constructively interfering wave packets, which move with the groupvelocity.
Narrow-band ltering can isolate the wave packets with specic central fre-
quencies (see Fig.4.26), and the group velocity for that frequency can then be
determined by simply dividing the path length along the surface by the observed
travel time. This technique can be used for the construction of dispersion curves
(see Sec. 4.22).</text>

by a wave speed gradient at some depth; there must be a layer over a half
space with the shear wave speed in the layer lower than in the half space. If
the shear wave speed increases with depth a wave guide is formed in which
rays are multiply reected between the free surface and the turning points of
the rays. In general, some energy may leak into the half space (if the form ofSHbody waves), unless the incoming SH-ray strikes the reecting interface at
(post) critical angles so that  eectively - a head wave is formed and allenergy is trapped within the wave guide (see Fig. 4.22). The headwave is also
evanescent, and its amplitude decreases in with increasing depth beneath the
layer (see box).
Figure 4.22: Trapped waves in the crust.
Since Love waves are interfering SH-waves, the particle motion is purely
horizontal, in the x2,o ry, direction. Wave guides formed by a low-wave speed
layer over a faster half space occur naturally in the Earth; the wave speed in the
crust is larger than that in the mantle beneath the Moho, and at larger depths
there can be a low velocity zone  in particular beneath oceanic lithosphere 
that can cause ecient Love-wave propagation. Love waves are observed only
on the transverse component (parallel to x2) of the displacement eld.
Propagation speed
From looking at data we can make an important observation: Love waves arrive
before Rayleigh waves. Love waves propagate intrinsically faster than Rayleigh
waves, see below, but the dierence is not large enough to explain the observed
advance of the Love wave arrival. Since Love waves involve only horizontal
displacement whereas Rayleigh waves are composed of P-waves and verticallyFigure by MIT OCW.Love wave Rayleigh wave</text>

we can write the equation of motion as :

dilatational rotational(4.31)
which is a system of three partial dierential equations for a general displace-
ment eld uthrough an unbounded, homogeneous, and isotropic medium.
In general, it is dicult to solve this system directly for the displacement u.
Typically, one tries to decompose the general wave equation into separate equa-
tions that relate to P- and S-wave propagation. One approach is to eliminate di-
rectly any rotational contributions to the displacement by taking the divergenceof Eq. (4.31) and using the property that for a vector eld a,(a)=0 .
Similarly we can eliminate the dilatational contributions by taking the rotation
of (4.31) and using the identity that, for a scalar eld , =0. Assuming
no body force f,w eg e t:

Its important to see Eq. 4.67 as what it is : a superposition (integral) of plane
waves with a certain wave vector and frequency, each with its own amplitude.The amplitude is a coecient which will have to be determined from the initial
or boundary conditions.
We thus have seen that the dispersion equation can be obtained either by
solving the wave equation by separation of variables or by introducing the timeand spatial Fourier transforms.
4.13 The wave eld  Snells law
In this section, well use plane wave displacement potentials to solve a sim-ple problem of wave propagation. Not only will we understand why and howreections, refractions and phase conversions happen, but well also derive an
important relation for plane waves in planar media known as Snells law.
Lets start with a plane P-wave incident on the free surface, making an angle
with the normal i. We can identify the P- w a v ew i t hi t sw a v ev e c t o r . I no u r

/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglesiniand k
z=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglecosi (4.69)
Two kinds of boundary conditions are used in seismology  there are the
kinematic ones, which put constraints on the displacement, and the dynamicones, which constrain the stresses or tractions. The free surface needs to be
traction-free. We remember that the traction vector was given by dotting the
stress tensor into the normal vector representing the plane on which we are
computing the tractions : t
i=ijnj. For a normal vector in the positive
z-direction, the traction becomes :
t(u,z)=(xz,yz,zz) (4.70)
For isotropic materials, we have seen the following denition for the stress ten-
sor :

placement potential  (see Eq. 4.47) :

Therefore the required components of the stress tensor are :</text>

Clearly, a simple scalar relationship between the stress and strain tensors
is invalid : ij/negationslash=E/epsilon1ij. Somehow we must express the elements of the stress
tensor as a linear combination of the elements of the strain tensor. This linear
combination is given by a 4thorder tensor cijklof elastic constants :
ij=Cijkl/epsilon1kl (4.24)
This form of the constitutive law for linear elasticity is known as the gener-
alized Hookes law andCis also known as the stiness tensor. Substitution of
eq (4.24) in (4.14) gives the wave equation for the transmission of a displacement
disturbance with wave speed dependent on density and the elastic constants

In three dimensions, a fourth order tensor contains 34=8 1e l e m e n t s .W h a t
did we gain by doing all this? After all, we mentioned above that we needed tointroduce a constitutive relationship in order to solve the wave equation (Eq.
4.14) since the number of equations was less than the number of unknowns.
Now we have arrived at a situation (Eq. 4.25) in which we have 3 equations
to solve for 82 unknowns (density + 81 elastic moduli), so the introduction of
physics does not seem to have helped us at all! The situation improves oncewe consider the intrinsic symmetry of the tensors involved. The symmetry
of the stress and strain tensors leads to symmetry of the elasticity tensor :
C
ijkl=Cijlk=Cjilk. This reduces the number of independent elements in
Cijklto 66=36. It can also be demonstrated (with less trivial arguments)
thatCijkl=Cklij, which further reduces the number of independent elements
inCijklto 21. This represents the most general (homogeneous) anisotropic
medium (anisotropy in this context means that the relationship between stress
and strain is dependent on the direction i).
By restricting the complexity of the medium we can further reduce the num-
ber of independent elements of the elasticity tensor. For instance, one can inves-
tigate special cases of anisotropy by allowing directional dependence in a planeperpendicular to certain symmetry axes only. We will come back to this later.
The simplest case is a homogeneous, isotropic medium (i.e. no directional
dependence of elastic properties), and it can be shown (see, e.g., Malvern (1969))
that in this situation the general form of the 4
thorder (linear) elasticity tensor
is
Cijkl=ijkl+(ikjl+iljk) (4.26)
where andare the only two independent elements; andare known as
Lames (elastic) constants (or moduli), after the French mathematician G. Lam e.
(The Kronecker (delta) function ij=1f o r i=jandij=0f o r i/negationslash=j).

prograde at larger depth (see Fig. 4.20). This is similar to the particle motion

The Rayleigh wave can thus be observed at both the vertical (in the direc-
tion of z) and horizontal (radial, i.e., in the direction of x) components of the
displacement eld (see also Fig. 4.21).
Love waves
Another type of surface wave, the Love wave , is formed by interaction of
theSH-waveeld and the free surface. In contrast to the critically refracted
waves that interfere to produce Rayleigh waves, there is no critical refraction of
SH-waves (angle of incidence = angle of reection) and in order to satisfy the
boundary conditions there must be total reection of the SH-waves at the free
surface. SHenergy can thus not be trapped near the surface in a half space. In
order for Love waves to exist SHenergy has to be reected back to the surfaceFigure by MIT OCW.

4.12 More on the dispersion relation
We have already introduced the concept of dispersion (Eq. 4.57). Searching for
a solution by separation of varibles, we have seen that the solution to the wave
equation is an exponential both in the time and space domain. We had, how-
ever,already shown the oscillatory behavior of the solution in the time domainby using the time Fourier transform. In this section, we go one step further.
Predicting that the solution will be a complex exponential in the spatial domain
as well, we will investigate what insight the spatial Fourier-transform will bringus. Time and space are linked through the wave equation (it is a PDE)  the
linkage between them is by the dispersion relation which we are deriving here.
As denition for the spatial Fourier transform and its inverse, we take

We can quickly convert this dispersion relation into something youre all familiar
with : with k=2/andf=/(2), we get f=c: the frequency of a wave
times its wave lengths gives the propagation speed. We will discuss this in more
detail below.
The complete solution to the wave equation is thus given by inverse trans-

between stress and strain does not hold in 2D or 3D, in which case we need theso-called generalized Hookes Law .F o r/summationtextF=mawe have to consider both the
non-contact body forces, such as gravity that works on a certain volume, as well
as the contact forces applied by the material particles on either side of arbitrary
and imaginary internal surfaces. The latter are represented by tractions (stress
vectors). We therefore have to look in some detail at the denitions of stressand strain.
4.3 Strain
The strain involves both length and angular distortions. To get the idea, lets
consider the deformation of a line element l1between xandx+x.
Due to the deformation position xis displaced to x+u(x)a n d x+xtox+
x+u(x+x)a n d l1becomes l2.
The strain in the xdirection, /epsilon1xx, can then be dened as
/epsilon1xx=l2l1
l1=u(x+x)u(x)
x(4.1)
If we assume that xis small we can linearize the problem around the reference
state u(x) by using a Taylor expansion on u(x+x):
u(x+x)=u(x)+/parenleftbiggu

which represents the normal strain in the x direction. Similar relationships
can be derived for the normal strain in the other principal directions and also for
theshear strain /epsilon1xyand/epsilon1xz(etc), which involve the rotation of line elements
within the medium.

cients, in seismology one typically uses a notation that sums from m=lto +l:
in both cases there are 2 l+ 1 coecients (this is called a 2 l+1degeneracy).
There are two basic types of free oscillation (1) spheroidal modes ,w h i c h
are analogous to the P-SV-system and the Rayleigh waves and have a component
of motion parallel to the radius from the Earths center; and (2) toroidal or tor-
sional modes involving shear motions parallel to the Earths surface, analogous
toSHand Love waves. Spheroidal modes involve expansion and contraction
of (parts of) the Earth, whereas toroidal modes involve dierential rotation of
parts of the globe. Gravity does not inuence the toroidal motion but long-
period spheroidal oscillations do involve signicant work against gravity; obser-
vation of these modes can therefore yield information about the Earths gross
density structure.
The toroidal and spheroidal modes are labeled nTland nSl, respectively,
where nindicates the number of nodes along the radius of the Earth5Torsional
modes are only sensitive to shear wave speed; spheroidal modes are sensitive
5The latter would be true if the Earth was homogeneous and uniform; in reality it is more
complicated. The behavior of normal modes in the Earth is complicated by stratication, the
existence of a uid outer core, by the rotation of the sphere, and, of course, by deviations
from sphericity (3D structure + anisotropy).Figure by MIT OCW.0S20S0 1S0 0T2 0T3

Intermezzo 4.5 Group velocity
Consider two harmonic waves with the same amplitude but slightly dierent
frequencies ( 1and2), wave numbers k1andk2, and phase velocities k1=
1/c1andk2=2/c2(see Fig. 4.24). These waves combine to give the total
displacement
u(x, t)=c o s ( k1x1t)+c o s ( k2x2t). (4.107)

it into (4.107) and apply the cosine rule 2 cos xcosy=c o s ( x+y)+c o s ( xy),
we obtain
u(x, t)=2c o s ( kxt)c o s(kx t) (4.108)
This is the product of two cosines, the second of which varies much more slowly
than the rst. The second cosine modulates the amplitude of the rst. The
propagation speed of this envelope is given by U()=/k ). In the limit as

The group velocity is related to interference of waves with slightly dierent phase

is typically smaller than the phase velocity.

speed).
Wavefront
A wavefront is a surface through all points of equal phase, i.e. a surface
connecting all points at the same travel time Tfrom the source (see Fig. 4.5).
In other words, at the wave front, all particles move in phase. Rays are thenormals to the wave fronts and they point in the direction of wave propagation.
The use of rays, ray paths, and wave fronts in seismology has many similarities
with optics, and is called geometric ray theory.
Figure 4.5: Seismic wavefronts.
Plane waves have plane wave fronts. The function  remains unchanged for
all points on the plane perpendicular to the wave vector : indeed, on such a
plane, the dot product kris constant.
At distances suciently far from the source body waves can be model-led
as plane waves. As a rule of thumb : observer must be more than 5 wave
lengths away from source to apply far eld  or plane wave  approximation.
Closer to the source one would need to consider spherical waves. Note that a
seismogram corresponds to the recording of u=u(r0,t)a ta x e dp o s i t i o n r0;
i.e. the displacement as a function of time that records the passage of a wavegroup past r
0.
Polarization direction
The polarization direction is dierent from the propagation direction. As
already mentionned in sections 4.8 and 4.7, all waves propagate in the direction
of their wave vector k.T h e P-wave displacement ( ) is parallel with the k.
TheSV-displacement ( (y)) is perpendicular to this, in the xzplane,
and the SH-displacement is out of the plane.</text>

interior implies that the energy decays as 1 over r2so that the amplitude of
body waves decays as 1 over r. As a result of the dierence in geometrical
spreading, the amplitude of surface waves is typically much larger than that of
body waves, in particular at larger distances from the source. (The distance
from source to receiver is typically referred to as the epicentral distance ).
Another implication of horizontal wave propagation and energy conservation
is that surface waves are evanescent , i.e., the amplitude decays with increasing
depth and goes to zero for very large depths. As a rule of thumb: the (funda-
mental mode of) surface waves are most sensitive at a depth z=/3, with the
wave length, and their sensitivity becomes very small for z&gt; . For example,
at a period of T= 100s, the wavelength is about 450 km. Those waves are
most sensitive in the upper 180 km of the mantle (where the shear wave speed
is about 4.5 km/s).
The fact that the amplitude of surface waves decays with depth as 1 over
means that long wave length (or low frequency) waves are more sensitive to
deeper structure than high frequency waves. In combination with the fact that,
in general, the wave speed changes with depth, this explains why surface waves
aredispersive : surface waves of dierent frequency propagate with dierent
wave speeds.
Due to the dispersion, the wave form will change with increasing distance
from the source so that it becomes less clear what is meant if one talks about
the velocity of surface waves; to understand dispersion it will be necessary to
consider two denitions of propagation velocity: group and phase velocity .
The surface waves are typically of substantially lower frequency than the
body waves. Owing to the low frequency (sometimes in the same range as the
eigenfrequencies of man made constructions) and their large amplitude, surface
waves typically cause most of the earthquake damage to buildings.
Rayleigh waves
Interference between PandSVwaves near the free surface4causes a type of
displacement known as Rayleigh waves .S i n c et h e SVwave speed is smaller
than the Pwave speed there is an angle of incidence for an incoming SVwave
that produces a critically refracted Pwave, which propagates horizontally along
the interface (see Fig. 4.18)
In other words, P-wave energy is trapped along the surface in a natural way,
i.e., it does not require any particular wave speed variations at depth (Rayleigh
waves can, in principle, exist in a half space). To conserve energy the amplitude
of the horizontally propagating Pwave must decrease with depth and vanish at
some point, i.e., a critically refracted Pwave is an evanescent wave.
4The boundary condition at the free surface is that the traction on that surface vanishes.

Final remarks
It is clear that the pcurves are the only curves associated with travel time
curves that are continuous in all circumstances, and this is a very attractive
property in, for instance, inversion of travel time information for Earths struc-
ture. In fact, this curve also plays a central role in the computation of synthetic
seismograms with the so-called WKBJ approximation.
A signicant body of research is based on the arrival times of rst arriving,
direct phases such as P. In triplication zones there are typically more than two
arrivals; there can be as many as 5 when triplication zones due to discontinuitiesat dierent depths overlap. The identication problem is aggravated due to the
eect of the caustics on the amplitude : near the cusps in the travel time curve
the later arriving triplication phases have signicantly higher amplitude than
the rst arrival and for small signal to noise ratio in the data (for instance when
theres a small earthquake) the rst arrival that can be identied in the recordcan, in fact, be a later arriving phase. This causes substantial scatter in the
arrival time data in these distance ranges.
The diculty of phase identication in the triplications due to upper mantle
discontinuities and the related uncertainty in the geometry of the ray paths
involved has important implications for the imaging of upper mantle structure,
which is more dicult than the imaging of lower mantle structure, and for the
accurate location of earthquake hypocenters using these data.
In seismological literature one encounters the terms regional andteleseis-
mic distances . The precise boundary between these distances is not well de-
ned. It basically refers to the distance ranges where eects of an upper mantle
low velocity layer and the discontinuities are (regional) or are not (teleseismic)signicant. Regional distance is the distance where the associated rays bottom
in the upper mantle and transition zone (i.e. above 660 km depth) and this is
about 25
to 30, with exact values dependent on the reference Earth model
used. Teleseismic arrivals refer to arrivals beyond the triplication range and
refer to turning rays in the lower mantle.
When waves pass through caustic (i.e. the arrivals on the receding branches
of the travel time curves, for instance the PKP ABphase and the reections o
a seismic discontinuity) the wave form will be distorted due to a 90phase shift
in the phase term i(r,t). This will cause additional complications in picking
the arrival time by hand. A better way is to generate synthetic waveforms that
have the same phase shifts and apply cross correlation techniques.</text>

minutes. In the last 4 decades many modes have been identied. This also is
a game of matching the observed spectra with model predictions, identifyingthe modes, using that to improve the reference Earth models, and the improved
starting models may then allow the identication of previously unknown modes.
Normal mode splitting: aspherical Earths structure
We have used the notation of modes in terms of SandTand the degree l
and the overtone number n, for instance 0S2. Just as in the use of spherical
harmonics to describe the gravity and magnetic elds we also have the order m
in seismology. (As a reminder: there are lnodal lines at the surface: there are
mnodal lines along great circles ( m=0 gives the zonal harmonics) and there
are thus lmnodal lines along latitude. For l/negationslash=m: tesseral harmonics). For
each angular degree lthere are 2 l+1v a l u e sf o r m. In a spherically symmetric,
non-rotating body the 2 l+ 1 modes have the same eigenfrequency, the modes
correspond to a single peak in the spectrum  the overlapping peaks are known
asmultiplets  and this redundancy is the reason why the superscript mis
usually ignored in the notation. However, the 5 dierent modes that constitute
0S2have dierent angular moments and when the body is rotating the 2 l+1
peaks, or singlets do not exactly overlap any more. This phenomenon is known
as the splitting of the modes. The split modes have eigenfrequencies that are
very close together so that interference occurs.
Splitting can be caused by rotation, but also by aspherical Earths structure
such as lateral variation in isotropic seismic properties (due to dynamic processes
in the mantle) or by seismic anisotropy. Conversely, the analysis of splitting
in the power spectra can give invaluable information about 3D structure andanisotropy.</text>

Thus the total P-potential  is made up from the incoming and reecting P-
wave, and the shear-wave potential  is given by the reected SV-wave. All of

As pointed out before, there are no kinematic boundary conditions on the
free surface. The displacement of the free surface is unconstrained, and above
it there is no displacement at all. The dynamic boundary conditions, however,are non-trivial. The tractions must vanish on the free surface : so 
xz=yz=
zz=0a t z= 0. It is easy to see that, with z= 0, the sum of the three plane

Thus, for plane waves in plane-layered media, the whole system of rays is
characterized by a common horizontal slowness. This is true for the whole wave
eld of reected and transmitted (refracted) waves. Eq. 4.90 is known as Snells
law and pis called the ray parameter . In the following paragraph, a more
general principle called Fermats principle is used to prove Snells Law.</text>

4.9 Plane waves
Weve called functions of the type exp( i(krt)) plane waves. Lets look at
a few characteristics.
Traveling waves Lets rst notice that plane waves are of the general form
describing traveling waves :
(x, t)=f(xct)+g(x+ct) (4.60)
withfandgarbitrary functions, provided that they are twice dierentiable
with regard to space and time (and that the second derivatives are continuous).
After all, they need to solve =c22. This is referred to as dAlemberts
solution . The function f(xct) represents a disturbance propagating in the
positive xdirection with speed c. The function g(x+ct) represents a disturbance
propagating in the negative xaxis : this part of the solution will be ignored
in the following, but it must be taken into account when dealing with waveinterference.
Wavelength
With k=2/, the spatial part can be manipulated as follows:
e
i2
x=ei2
xei2N=ei2
(x+N )(4.61)
to show that is indeed the wave length  after this distance, the displacement
pattern repeats itself.
Figure 4.4: Plane waves : propagating disturbances.
Phase
With increasing time tthe argument of function fdoes not change provided
thatxalso increases (hence the propagation in the positive xaxis). In other
words, if the argument remains constant it means that the shape dened by
function ftranslates through space. The argument of f,xct, is referred to as
the phase; one can dene the wave front as the propagating function for a givenFigure by MIT OCW.t = t0

The dilatational and rotational components of the displacement eld are
known as the PandS-waves, and andare the PandS-wave speed, respec-
tively.
Another (more elegant) way to see that solutions of the wave equation are
in fact PandS-waves is by realizing that any vector eld can be represented by
a combination of the gradient of some scalar potential and the curl of a vector
potential. This decomposition is known as Helmholtzs Theorem and the
potentials are often referred to as Helmholtz Potentials . Using Helmholtzs
Theorem we can write for the displacement u

.= 0 (4.39)
with  a rotation-free scalar potential (i.e.  = 0) and the divergence-
freevector potential . Substitution of (4.38) into the general wave equation (4.31)
(and applying the vector identity (4.30)) we get :
[(+2)2] +[2] = 0 (4.40)
which is a third-order dierential equation3. Equation (4.40) can be satised
by requiring that both

ment eld  with wave speed

3Strictly speaking this is not the way to formulate the problem. The need to solve third-
order dierential equations could have been avoided if the problem was set up in a dierentway by making use of what is known as Lames theorem . This also involves Helmholtz
potentials. See, for instance, Aki &amp; Richards, Quantitative Seismology (1982) p. 67-69.
This mathematical correctness is, however, not required for a basic understanding of the

4.2 Introduction
With seismology1we face the same problem as with gravity and geomagnetism;
we can simply not oer a comprehensive treatment of the entire subject within
the time frame of this course. The material is therefore by no means complete.We will discuss some basic theory to show how expressions for the propagation of
elastic waves, such as PandSwaves, can be obtained from the balance between
stress and strain. This requires some disc ussion of continuum mechanics. Before
we do that, lets look at a very brief  and incomplete  overview of the historical
development of seismology. Modern seismology is characterized by alternations
of periods in which more progress is made in theory development and periods
in which the emphasis seems to be more on data collection and the application
of existing theory on new and  often  better quality data. Its good to realizethat observational seismology did not kick o until late last century (see section
4.1). Prior to that seismology was eectively restricted to the development
of the theory of elastic wave propagation, which was a popular subject formathematicians and physicists. For some important dates, see attachment above
table (this historical overview is by no means complete but it does give an idea
of the developments of thoughts). Lay &amp; Wallace (1995) give their view on
the current swing of the research pendulum in the following tables (with source

We will discuss some classical concepts and also discuss some of the more
current  topics. Before we can do this we have to deal with some basic theory.
In principle, what we need is a formulation of the seismic source, equations to
describe elastic wave propagation once motion has started somewhere, and atheory for coupling the source description to the solution for the equations of
motion. We will concentrate on the former two problems. The seismic waves

Tractions due to the SHwave
TheSHwave, as weve seen, has only one component in this coordinate
system :

and the stress tensor components are given by
xz= 0 (4.81)

Comparing Eqs. 4.75 and 4.79, we see how PandSVwaves are naturally
coupled. In this plane-wave plane-layered case, the P-wave had energy only
in the x-a n d z-component, and so did SV. Upon reection and refraction,
energy can be transferred from the incoming P-wave to a reected P-wave and
a reected SV-wave. No SHwaves can enter the system  they have all their
energy on the y-component.
Analogously to Eq. 4.69, we can represent the incoming P, the reected P
and the reected SVwave by the following slownesses :</text>

Intermezzo 4.2 Diagonalization of a matrix
Many problems in (geo)physics can be simplied if we can diagonalize a matrix.
Under certain conditions (almost always satised in geophysics), for any squarematrix Aof dimension n,t h e r ee x i s t sa nnmatrix Xthat diagonalize A:
X
1AX ==diag(1,..., n)
=
10... ... 0
020 ... 0
0... ... ... 0
0...0n10
0... ... 0 n
(4.15)
This means that there exists a coordinate system in which Ais diagonal. Di-
agonalizing Acorresponds to nding this coordinate system and the values of
the diagonal elements of Ain this coordinate system. We can rewrite the last
equation as follows :
AX=X (4.16)
or
(AI)X=0 (4.17)
Iis the Identity matrix. The i(i=1,...,n) are called the eigenvalues ofA
and the columns of Xare formed by n eigenvectors . Diagonalizing a matrix is
equivalent to nding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This is called an eigen-
value problem. Finding the eigenvalues can easily be done by solving the system
ofnlinear equations and nunknowns (the i) formed by Eq. 4.17. This has a
non-trivial solution if the determinant is zero (this is called Cramers rule) :
|AI|= 0 (4.18)
The eigenvectors can then be found by replacing the eigenvalues in the system of
linear equations formed by Eq. 4.17. If all eigenvalues are dierent, the neigen-
vectors are linearly independent and orthogonal. Otherwise, the eigenvalues aresaid to be degenerate and the number of independent eigenvectors is given by the
number of independent eigenvalues. In the case of nindependent eigenvalues,
the eigenvectors can form a new orthogonal basis and they are called principal
axes. If we change the coordinate system and use the system dened by the
principal axes, matrix Abecomes diagonal and its elements are given by the
eigenvalues.In the case of the stress tensor, equation 4.17 takes the form :
(I)n=0 (4.19)
The three eigenvalues (also called principal stresses and represented by the
scalar ) are thus found by solving :
|I|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 12 13
21 22 23
31 32 33/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
= 0 (4.20)
This will give three values for (1,2and3). In the coordinate system
formed by the three principal axes ni, the stress tensor is diagonal, as expressed
in Eq. 4.10.</text>

3. The second important deviation from the normal situation is when there
is a region where the wave speed increases rapidly with increasing depth :v/r &gt;&gt; 1 (see Fig. 4.17). Lets for the discussion assume that the
increase in wave speed occurs instantly, i.e. that there is a seismic dis-
continuity inv/r (the function v(r) itself is  of course  continuous;
this situation is also known as a rst order discontinuity), but you must
realize that similar eects occur when the gradient in wave speed is steep.
Ray paths : For large incidence angles the rays turn above the dis-
continuity. These form the direct rays. When the incidence angle
(or, equivalently, the ray parameter) decreases the rays will reect atthe interface. The ray with the smallest ray parameter that does not
reect is called the grazing ray . The rays that are reected from
the interface form arrivals at shorter distances those correspondingto the grazing ray. This leads to a situation where there is a distance
range where we have arrivals of both the direct and the reected
waves. The situation is slightly more complicated because when the
ray parameter continues to decrease, there is a critical angle where
the rays no longer reect but refract into the deeper earth. Fromthat point onward, the behavior of the rays is as one would expect
from the normal situation, and the rays go to larger distances. The
reection will cause the ray paths to cross which causes a caustic
and results in large amplitudes of the phase arrivals.
T() : The corresponding travel time curve is complicated. In the
distance range between the arrival of the waves associated with the
grazing ray and the critical ray there are, in fact, three arrivals : thedirect phase propagating through the medium above the interface,
the reected phase, and the refracted wave that propagates in part
in the medium beneath the interface. This distance range it, there-fore, called the triplication range because there are, in fact, three
arrivals.
p() : For large ray parameters the behavior is as in the standard sit-
uation; a gradual increase in distance with decreasing p(p/&lt;0).
When pbecomes smaller than that of the grazing ray the reection
causes the distance to decrease with decreasing p(p/&gt;0), but
when pdecreases further and becomes smaller than the for the critical
ray the distance increases again ( p/&lt;0).
Amplitude : there are two points in the p() curve where p/b e -
comes very large (in ray theory the slope can go to innity!). These
two points correspond to the ray parameter for the grazing and criti-cally refracted rays, respectively. Consequently, the amplitude of the
phase arrival will be large on either end of the triplication range.</text>

4.20 Excitation of surface waves
Figure 4.23: Phase speed sensitivity kernels.
Fig. 4.23 can be used to understand in qualitative sense the excitation of
surface waves by earthquakes. In general, the position of the earthquake (i.e.
the depth in our case of depth-dependent media) determines which modes canbe excited. A fundamental mode has no displacement deeper than a certain
depth; by reciprocity, a source (assume a white spectrum of the source so that it
can  in principle  excite all frequencies) that is located at those large depth
will not cause displacement of that fundamental mode at the surface.
4.21 Dispersion: phase and group velocity
The dependence of the depth of penetration on the period is described by the
sensitivity kernels. If the wave speed is constant in the half space the waves
associated with dierent kernels travel with the same wave speed and thus arrive</text>

1. The ray parameter pis 1/cx, which is referred to as the horizontal slow-
ness!
2. the ray parameter is simply the derivative of the travel time Twith hor-
izontal distance. This will prove to be of major importance (and conve-
nience!).
For a spherical earth we can derive a relationship for the ray parameter that
is similar to Eq. (4.98), the only dierence being the scale factor r:
p=rsini

at that radius. It can also be shown that (with  the angular distance)
p=T
(4.100)
Figure 4.12: Ray parameter in spherical geometry
Notice the similarity between the denition of the ray parameter as the
spatial derivative of travel time for the at (Eq. 4.98) and spherical earth(Eq. 4.100)! Beware : For a at earth the unit of ray parameter is s/km (or
s/m), for the spherical earth it is either s/rad or just s or s/deg, so even though
the denitions are completely equivalent there are dierences in units!
With the denition for the ray parameter in a spherical Earth (Eq. 4.99)
we can also get a simple expression that relates pto the minimum radius (or
maximum depth) along the ray path : this point is known as the turning or
bottoming point of the ray. A turning ray is the spherical Earth equivalent
of the head wave (see Fig. 4.12).

Under the assumption of a reference earth model for seismic wave speeds we
can determine the horizontal distance traveled by the ray (e.g., from 4.98) and
the depth to the turning point (from Eq. 4.101) once we know the ray parameter.
Before showing how the ray parameter can be determined from observed data,
let me mention another important concept based on the ray parameter :</text>

Travel time curves
Eq. (4.98) indicates that the ray parameter, i.e. the horizontal slowness ,c a nb e
determined from seismic data by determining the dierence in travel time of aphase arrival at two adjacent stations. Ideally one uses an array of instruments
to do this accurately.
Figure 4.13: Determination of the ray with a seismometer array
In other words, one can determine the value of the ray parameter directly from
the travel time curve, which represents the variation of travel time as a functionof distance : T(X)o rT(). A travel time curve can be constructed by arrang-
ing observed records of ground motion due to the same explosion or earthquake
as a function of distance. In such a record section the travel time curve of a
particular phase is just the curve that connect onset times of that phase in all
records. One could also construct a travel time curve by using many measure-
ments, phase picks , of the travel time of particular phases, say the P-phase, at
dierent distances from the source. Seismologists try to nd simple models of
radial variations of wave speed that produce travel time curves consistent withthe observed data. Theoretical travel time curves in this sense are thus best
tting curves determined from some reference model of seismic wave speeds.
Well known models for the Earths depth dependent structure are the Pre-
liminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) by Dziewonski &amp; Anderson
(1981), and the more recent iasp91 model (Kennett &amp; Engdahl, 1991). Typ-
ically, this tting is not done by trial and error but by means of inversion of
either the travel times or the travel time curves. A classical approach that is
discussed in most text books is the one rst applied by Herglotz and Wiechert
in the beginning of this century. They were the rst to invert travel time datafor simple radially stratied models of seismic wave speed, and their technique
has been used for decades. The rst comprehensive model and the correspond-
ing travel time tables was published by Jereys &amp; Bullen (1939/1940). In facttheir model, known as the JB model , is still being used for routine earthquake
location by the International Seismological Centre in the U.K.
The ray parameter of a seismic wave (group) arriving at a certain distance
can be thus be determined from the slopeof the travel time curve. The straight
line tangent to the travel time curve at  can be written as a function of the</text>

4.8 Solution by separation of variables
In a way, weve solved the wave equation by realizing that we could reduce it to
an ordinary dierential equation using the Fourier transform. So we knew the
solution would be a complex exponential in the time variable (it is a natural
way of describing a wave). We will now justify the validity of this approach byattempting to solve the following partial dierential equation :

without resorting to the Fourier transform.
If we propose a solution by separation of variables :

One can expand on this simple geometry and consider many more layers,
but the result is the same : the ray parameter p is constant along the entire ray !
As a ray enters material of increasing velocity, the ray is deected toward the
horizontal; if the ray enters material with lower velocity, the ray is deected to
the vertical. In seismology the angle between the ray and the vertical is referred
to as the angle of incidence (also,take-o angle ).
4.15 Ray geometries of the wave eld
For most applications we have to deal with a complex wave eld : in each layer
of a stratied medium there can be 6 dierent body wave groups : the up- and
down-going P,SV,a n dSH-waves. The propagation of such a wave eld through
a stratied medium (a stack of horizontal layers or spherical shells in which the
wave speed is constant) is controlled by Snells law (Fermats Principle) and
boundary conditions.
The wave eld is determined by reections ,refractions ,a n dphase con-
versions ; for instance, a down-going Pwave can reect at an interface and part
of its energy can be transmitted to the other side, and part of its energy can
(or often has to be )c o n v e r t e dt o SV-wave energy (see Fig. 4.10).
Figure 4.10: Ray conversions at interfaces.
The incidence angles of the reected and refracted waves that compose this
complex wave eld are controlled by an extended form of Snells law. For this
example, Snells law is :
sini1
1=sinj1
1=sini2
2=sinj2
2p (4.95)
This generalization of Snells law shows an important concept that the whole
system of seismic waves produced by reection and transmission of plane waves
in a stratied medium is characterized by the value of their common horizontalslowness, or the ray parameter p. It can also be used directly to determine the
angles for critical reection and refraction. The ray parameter is constant not
only for a single ray, but for the entire wave eld generated by reection and
refraction of an incoming PorS-wave.</text>

Normal modes and overtones
To get some insight in the problem, lets consider the simple situation of vibra-
tions of a string held xed at either end. The motions in the string must obey
the 1D wave equation, with cthe phase velocity:

The general solution of this equation is
u(x, t)=Aei(t+x

The constants ADcan be determined from the boundary conditions, i.e.
the xed end points: u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0 .T h e r s tg i v e s A=BandC=D.
The condition at x=Lthen gives
(AeitCeit)2isin/parenleftbiggL
c/parenrightbigg
= 0 (4.112)
which has nontrivial solutions for L/c =(n+1 ),n=0,1,2,3,.
These discrete frequencies, labeled n, are called the eigenfrequencies of this
bounded system. The corresponding displacements, Eq. (4.110), are the eigen-
functions or normal modes of the system and are of the form u=e x p ( int)sin( nx/c).
Thefundamental mode is given for n= 0, and has no internal nodes (where
u= 0) within the system; n&gt;0 corresponds to higher modes orovertones ,
which have ninternal nodes. It is important to realize that the motion of each
of the modes occurs without horizontal motion of the nodes: they are stand-
ing waves and the modes themselves dont propagate horizontally. However,
constructive interference of the coexisting vibrations corresponds to traveling
waves. We have previously said that PandS-waves are the complete solutions
to the wave equation, and it can be shown that the normals modes of free oscil-
lations are, in fact, not fundamentally dierent from the body waves. Normal
modes can be used to describe body wave propagation. Indeed, any propagat-
ing disturbance can be represented by an innite weighted sum of the eigen
frequencies (Fourier series!) so that normal mode summation can be used tosimulate propagating waves such as body waves and surface waves:

basically result from the balance between stress and strain, and we will therefore
have to introduce some concepts of continuum mechanics and work out general
stress-strain relationships.
Intermezzo 4.1 Some terminology
For most of the derivations we will use the Cartesian coordinate system and
denote the position vector with either x=(x1,x2,x3)o rr=(x, y, z). The
displacement of a particle at position xand time tis given by u=(u1,u2,u2)=
u(x,t), this is the vector distance from its position at some previous time t0
(Lagrangian description of motion). The velocity and acceleration of the particle
are given by u=u/tandu=2u/2t, respectively. Volume elements are
denoted by  Vand surface elements by S.B o d y( o r non-contact ) forces, such
as gravity, are written as fand tractions by t.A traction is the stress vector
representing the force per unit area across an internal oriented surface Swithin
a continuum, and this is, in fact, the contact force Fper unit area with which
particles on one side of the surface act upon particles on the other side of thesurface.A general form of a wave equation is 
2u/2t=c22u/2xoru=c22u,
which is a dierential equation describing the propagation of a displacementdisturbance uwith speed c.

based on two equations : Newtons second law (/summationtextF=ma=m2u/2t)a n d

From analysis of a displacement potential it can be shown that the amplitude
A(z) of a horizontally propagating, critically refracted P-wave decays with in-
creasing depth.

ponents of the P-wave slowness. From the vector properties of the slowness it
follows that p2+2

A similar expression can be given for the SV-wave, with instead of .
The fact that the argument of the exponential component of the amplitude
factor is real has important implications for the admissible wave speeds. Since
t h ew a v en u m b e r =kzis related to |k|=2/,w i t h the wavelength,
it also follows that the amplitude decay with depth is larger for small wavelengths than for long wave lengths, and this is of fundamental importance forthe understanding of the dispersion of surface waves. (NB the horizontally
propagating, evanescent P-wave must interfere everywhere with SV-waves; this
can be achieved if there is an incoming SV-waveeld but for Rayleigh waves
the evanescent P-wave interferes with a horizontally propagating, and thus also
evanescent, SV-wave.)
Along the interface the critically refracted P-wave exists simultaneously with
the incident SV-wave; in fact, the evanescent P-waves alone do not satisfy the
stress-free boundary conditions and they cannot propagate along the interface
without coupling to SV. The interference of PandSV-wave produces a particleFigure by MIT OCW.X3 X3PISvRSvI SvRPRPnX1 X1

Note that body forces such as gravity cannot always be ignored in  what is
known as  low-frequency seismology . For instance, gravity is an important
restoring force for some of Earths free oscillations. We can also introduce a
body force term to describe the seismic source.
Weve derived Eq. 4.14 using index notation. Lets state it in vector form.
The acceleration is proportional to the divergence of the stress tensor (see In-
termezzo 4.3) :
u= (4.21)
Equation (4.14) represents, in fact, three equations (for i=1,2,3) but there are
more than three unknowns (the 6 independent elements of the stress tensor ij
plus density . In this general form the equation of motion does not have a
unique solution. Also, we have introduced forces and tractions but we not yet
specied howthe material reacts to the applied (non-)contact forces. We need
some physics to help us out. Specically, we need to know the relationship
between stress and strain, i.e. a constitutive relationship.
Intermezzo 4.3 Divergence of a tensor
We know how to dene the divergence of a vector. The divergence of a tensor
is simply the generalization to higher dimensions of the divergence of a vector(remember that a vector is nothing more than a tensor of dimension 1).The divergence of a vector vis a scalar denoted by /triangleinv.vand given by :
/triangleinv.v=/summationdisplay
ivi
xi=v1

Similarly, the divergence of a dimension 2 tensor is a vector whose components
are given by :
(/triangleinv.)j=/summationdisplay
iij
xi=1j
x1+2j
x2+3j
x3(4.23)
And we can further generalize : the divergence of a n-dimension tensor is a
tensor of dimension n-1obtained in a way similar to Eq. 4.23.
In one-dimension this relationship is given, as mentioned before, by =E/epsilon1
(ori=E/epsilon1i,where E is the Youngs modulus, which is the ratio of uniaxial
stress to strain in the same direction, i.e. a measure of the resistance against
extension. A simple example demonstrates that in more dimensions this scalar
proportionality breaks down. Imagine an elastic band : if one stretches thisband in one direction, say the x
1direction, than the band will extend in that
direction. In other words there will be strain e11due to stress 11. However, the
strap will also thin in the x2andx3directions; so e22=e33/negationslash= 0 even though

Comparing Eq. 4.33 and 4.41, we can identify  with the volume change ( u
is called the cubic dilatation). Similarly, can be identied with the rotational
component of the displacement eld by comparing Eq. 4.36 and 4.42.
It is often much easier to solve the wave equations (4.41) and (4.43) than to
solve the equation of motion directly for u, and from the solution for the poten-
tials the displacement ucan then determined directly by Eq. (4.38). Note that
even though PandS-waves are often treated separately, the totaldisplacement
eld comprises both wave types.

SH-wave (see Fig. 4.2) The displacement uyfrom the SV-wave potential is in

angle (i.e. let the ray dive steeper into the Earth).
1. The situation that applies to most depth ranges in the Earths interior is
that of a steady increase in seismic wave speed (see Fig. 4.15) so that:
Ray paths : the rays sample progressively deeper regions in the Earth,
T() : and arrive at progressively larger distances.
p() : the slope of the travel time curves decrease monotonically with
increasing distance (i.e. the ray parameter decreases for waves travel-
ing to larger distances), so there are no signicant changes in ampli-tude (other than those due to geometrical spreading!) ( p/&lt;0).
the intercept time decreases with increasing ray parameter (de-
creasing distance!)
A look at the travel time curves suggests that this situation is indeed very
common and describes the overall character of the curves pretty well.
Figure 4.16: Case : The presence of a low-velocity zone.
2. The rst important deviation from this situation is when there is a decrease
in wave speed with increasing depth or decreasing radius (see Fig. 4.16).This gives rise to some interesting eects.
Ray paths : The rays will still sample progressively deeper regions
when the ray parameter decreases, but the pattern is more complex.Initially (i.e. above the depth where the wave speed drops) the be-
havior is the same as in the general situation above. However, when
the ray parameter decreases further the rays interact with the lowvelocity zone. (A sucient condition for the low velocity zone is
thatv/r &lt; v/r .) The decrease in wave speed results in the deec-
tion of the ray toward the vertical and the rays do not turn within
the low velocity zone; they only reect back to the Earths surface to</text>

with  the cubic dilation , or volume change. This form of Hookes law was
rst derived by Navier (1820-ies). The Lam e constant is known as the shear
modulus or rigidity : it is a measure of the resistance against shear or torsion
of the medium. The shear modulus is large for very sti material, but is small
for media with low viscosity ( = 0 for water or for liquid metallic iron in the
outer core). The other Lam e constant, , does not have much (general) physical
meaning by itself, but denes important elastic parameters in combination withthe shear modulus . Of most interest for us right now is the denition of ,
thebulk modulus orincompressibility :=+2/3. The bulk modulus is
a measure of the resistance against volume change : =P/, with Pthe
pressure and  the cubic dilatation, and is large when the change in volume is
small even for large (hydrostatic) pressure. The minus sign is necessary to keep
&gt;0s i n c e &lt;0w h e n P&gt;0. For isotropic media other important elastic
parameters, such as the Poissons ratio, i.e. the ratio of lateral contraction to
longitudinal extension, and Youngs modulus can also be expressed as linearcombinations of and(orand). We can readily see that the stress tensor
consists of terms representing (resistance to) either changes in volume or shear
(or torsion).

This is a fundamental result and it underlies, what we will see below, the for-
mulation of wave propagation in terms of compressional (dilatational) Pand
transversal (shear) S-waves.
With the above constitutive relationships we can now derive the equation
that describes wave propagation in a homogeneous, isotropic medium

which represents a system of three equations (for i=1,2,3) with three unknowns
(,,). Note that for practical purposes in seismology these parameters are not
really constant; in Earth they are functions of position rand vary signicantly,
in particular with depth.
4.6 Pand S-waves
There are several ways to demonstrate that solutions of the equation of motion
essentially consist of a dilatational and a rotational term, the PandS-waves,
respectively. Using vector notation the equation of motion is written as
u=(+)(u)+2u (4.29)
or, by making use of the vector identity
2u=(u)( u), (4.30)</text>

T() = +T

and this equation forms the basis of what is known as the pmethod.
Figure 4.14: Determination of the ray parameter from the travel-
time curve
The (local) slope of the travel time curve contains important information about
the horizontal slowness, and thus about the wave speed, and the intercept time
,t h ezero oset time , contains information about the layer thickness. This
property is exploited in exploration seismics, where we typically deal with traveltime curves that consist of segments of straight lines (see Fig. 4.14).
Another piece of information that can be obtained from travel time curves
is contained in the second derivative of the travel time curve with distance, or
the variation of ray parameter with distance p/. This quantity controls the
amplitude of the arrivals. To see this, consider a situation (that we will discuss
in more detail below) in which rays with dierent incident angles at the source
(and receiver) are somehow focused to travel to the same seismographic station
so that the amplitude increases. In that case, p/negationslash= 0 but =0s o
p
=2T
2 (4.103)
In other words, the larger p/, the more energy arrives at a small distance
range , and the higher the amplitude. In real life the amplitude of seismic
waves is always nite, and this reveals, in fact, one of the shortcomings ofray theory. If rays are assumed to be innitesimally narrow the theoretical
amplitude can go to innity, but in practice the amplitude remains nite as a
result of the interference of the waves that arrive at the same time.
4.17 Radial Earth structure
In a spherical earth we typically encounter three important situations that arecharacterized by the geometry of the ray paths, the travel time curves T(), the
variation of the ray parameter with distance p(), and the (p) curves. In the
following, just imagine what happens if you shoot rays from an earthquake
source at the surface to increasing distances. In other words, you start of with</text>

4.7 for more details) can be recorded completely with three orthogonal
sensors. In seismometry one uses a vertical component [Z] sensor alongwith two horizontal component sensors. In the eld the latter two are
oriented along the North-South [N] and East-West [E] directions, respec-
tively. Fig. 4.7 is an example of such a three-component recording; we
will come back to this in more detail later in the course.

4.11 Nomenclature of body waves in Earths in-
terior
At this stage it is useful to introduce the jargon used to describe the dierent
types of body wave propagation in Earths interior. We will get back to severalwave propagation issues in more detail after we have discussed the basics of
ray theory and the construction and use of travel time curves. There are a few
simple basic rules, but there a re also some inconsistencies :
Capital letters are used to denote body wave propagation (transmission)
through a medium. For example, PandSfor the compressional and shear
waves, respectively, KandIfor outer and inner core propagation of com-
pressional waves ( Kfor German Kerne; Ifor Inner core), and Jfor shear
wave propagation in the Inner Core (no denitive observations of this seis-
mic phase, although recent research has produced compelling evidence for
its existence).</text>

Thus : the ithcomponent of the traction vector tis given by a linear combination
of stresses acting in the ithdirection on the surface perpendicular to xj(or
parallel to nj), where j=1,2,3;
ti=jinj (4.7)
Conversely, an element jiof the stress tensor is dened as the ithcomponent
of the traction acting on the surface perpendicular to the jthaxis (xj):
ij=ti(xj) (4.8)
The 9 components jiof all tractions form the elements of the stress tensor.
It can be shown that in absence of body forces the stress tensor is symmetric

 (4.9)
The normal stresses are represented by the diagonal elements (i=j) and the
shear stresses are the o diagonal elements ( i/negationslash=j). We can diagonalize the
stress tensor by changing our coordinate system in such a way that there are
no shear stresses on the surfaces perpendicular to any of the principal axes (see
Intermezzo 4.2). The stress tensor then gets the form of

polarized SV-waves, the observed advance of the Love waves suggests a form of
seismic anisotropy with faster wave propagation in the horizontal plane than
in the vertical direction (a situation known as transverse isotropy ).
It can be shown, using the information given in the box below, that for
horizontally propagating waves to be evanescent they must travel with a prop-agation velocity cthat is always smaller than the compressional wave speed ,
c=1/p &lt;  , and also smaller than the shear wave speed ,c=1/p &lt;  .I f
1/pthe amplitude of the surface waves no longer decays with depth and
conservation of energy is then achieved by the leaking of energy into the half
space in the form of body waves ( SVin the case of Rayleigh waves and SHin
the case of Love waves). If this happens one speaks of leaky modes .
So Rayleigh waves always propagate with a speed that is lower than the
shear wave speed. For a half space with shear wave speed 
1, the propagation
speed of the Rayleigh wave is about 0 .91. (In the Earth the situation is more
complicated because of the radial variation of both PandS-wave speed: if the
wave speed gradually increases with depth from c=1at the surface to c=2
in the half space: 0 .91&lt;c Rayleigh &lt;0.92). We will see below that the surface-
wave propagation speed depends on the wave length, and thus on frequency, of
the wave (dispersion). For Love waves it is slightly dierent. Here its the
head wave that is evanescent; for high-frequency waves (short wavelengths) the
evanescent head wave hardly penetrates into the half space (suppose a shearwave speed of 
2) so that the propagation speed is dominated by SH-propagation
in the layer over the half space (propagation speed c=1). For longer period
Love waves, the head wave is sensitive to as much larger depth range and thepropagation speed gets closer to the shear wave speed in the half space ( 
2).
Thus: 1&lt;c Love&lt; 2.
4.19 Sensitivity kernels
For evanescent waves such as Rayleigh and Love waves we have seen that long
wavelength waves penetrate deeper into the half space than short-wavelength
waves. As a rule of thumb, at a depth of 0.4 the amplitude is reduced to
1/eof its value at the surface, and wave propagation is inuenced by structure
anywhere in this depth interval. How exactly structure in a certain depth in-
terval inuences a wave of a particular frequency is described by a sensitivity
kernel . They represent the maximum partical motion at a certain depth as a
function of frequency, which can be computed from a reference Earth model. A
few examples are given below.
These kernels are a sort of Greens functions and they are typically con-
volved with (a model of) Earth structure in order to synthesize observables such
as waveforms. (Note: we have seen someting like this before: in travel time to-mography I mentioned that one solves the system of equations given by  in
matrix notation  Am=d,w i t h mthe model vector and dthe data vector.
The matrix Acontains the kernels and is therefore sometimes referreed to as
thesensitivity matrix . In the case of travel-time tomography the kernels, the</text>

To indicate explicitly the propagation in the direction of or perpendicular to
wave vector k, one sometimes also writes
forP-waves: for S-waves:
(r,t)=Ankei(krt)(r,t)=Bnkei(krt)(4.62)
Low- and high-frequency seismology
The variables used to describe the harmonic components are related as fol-
lows;
Angular frequency =kc
Wavelength =cT=2/k
Wavenumber k=/c
Frequency f=/2=c/
Period T=1/f=/c=2/
Seismic waves have frequencies franging roughly from about 0.3 mHz to
100 Hz. The longest period considered in seismology is that associated with
fundamental free oscillations of the earth : T59 min. For a typical wave
speed of 5 km/s this involves signal wavelengths between 15,000 km and 50m.
A loose subdivision in seismological problems is based on frequency, although
the boundaries between these elds are vague (and have no physical meaning) :
low frequency seismology f&lt;20 mHz &gt;250 km
high frequency seismology 50 mHz &lt;f&lt; 10 Hz 0.5 km &lt;&lt; 100 km
exploration seismics: f&gt;10 Hz &lt;500 m
4.10 Some remarks
1. The existence of Pand S-waves was rst demonstrated by Poisson (in
1828). He also showed that PandS-type waves are, in fact, the only solu-
tions of the wave equations for an unbounded medium (a whole space), so
thatu=+provides the complete solution for the displacement
in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous medium. Later we will see that
if the medium is not unbounded, for instance a half-space with perhaps
some stratication, there are more solutions to the general equation of
motions. Those solutions are the surface (Rayleigh and Love) waves.
2. Since &gt;0a n d 0&gt; :P-waves propagate faster than shear
waves! See Fig. 4.6.
3. It can be shown that independent propagation of the PandS-waves is only
guaranteed for suciently high frequencies (the so-called high-frequency
approximation , high frequency in the sense that spatial variations in</text>

early part of the 19thcentury when mathematicians (Poisson, Rayleigh) stud-
ied elastic wave propagation extensively. However, in absence of sensitive long-
period seismometers the normal models of free oscillation of the Earth remained
undetected until the Benio strain seismometer recorded the low-frequency sig-
nal due to a great earthquake in Kamchatka (1952). With the global network ofhighly sensitive broad-band seismometers many (many more than 1500) normal
modes have now been observed and identied.
The tone of the ringing contains information about the structure of the
Earths interior. Since the entire Earth is involved in the free oscillations, the
normal modes are more sensitive to average properties and whole-earth structure
than to local anomalies. Of particular re levance is also that the low-frequency
waves have to do work against gravity so that records of the modes contain in-
formation about the density distribution within the Earth. For these reasons the
normal modes have played a central role in the development of global referencemodels for seismic properties.
A second important implication of normal modes is that the displacement of</text>

of deformation we do not consider translation and/or rotation of the materialitself). Equation (4.4) shows that the strain tensor is symmetric, so that there
the maximum number of dierent coecients is 6.
4.4 Stress
Stress is force per unit area, and the principle unit is Nm2(or Pascal :1 N m2=1 P a ) .
Similar to strain, we can also distinguish between normal stress ,t h ef o r c e
Fper unit area that is perpendicular to the surface element S,a n dt h e shear
stress ,w h i c hi st h ef o r c e F/bardblper unit area that is parallel to S(see Fig. 4.1).
The force Facting on the surface element Scan be decomposed into three
components in the direction of the coordinate axes : F=(F1,F2,F3). We
further dene a unit vector nnormal to the surface element S. The length of
nis, of course, |n|=1 .
For stress we dene the traction as a vector that represents the total force
per unit area on S. Similar to the force F, also the traction ttcan be decom-
posed into t=(t1,t2,t3)=t1x1+t2x2+t3x3. The traction trepresents the
total stress acting on S.
In order to obtain a more useful denition of the traction tin terms of
elements of the stress tensor consider a tetrahedron. Three sides of the tetra-
hedron are chosen to be orthogonal to the principal axes in the sense that  si
is orthogonal to xi; the fourth surface, S, has an arbitrary orientation. The
stress working on each of the surfaces of the tetrahedron can be decomposed
into components along the principal axes of the coordinate system. We use thefollowing notation convention : the component of the stress that works on the

For example, the mode 0T2corresponds to alternating twisting of the entire

to similar twisting of the center of the sphere, but now with twisting in the
reverse direction of the outer part of the sphere (see Fig. 4.32). The modes

equatorial bands of zero displacement, 0S3has three nodal lines etc. (see Fig.

any number of normal modes can be summed as a Fourier series, with certain
weights for the dierent frequencies, in order to construct synthetic seismograms
(a technique known as mode summation ). In fact, body and surface-wave
propagation can be simulated by superposition of a sucient number of fun-damental and higher modes. In the discussion of surface waves we considered
a at Earth and an innite half space (overlain, in case of Love waves, by a
low wave speed wave guide). This is only useful to derive some fundamentalproperties, in particular at relatively short periods ( T&lt;200s), but for long
period surface waves , which penetrate deep into the Earths interior and for
the interference of waves that have propagated along the circumference of the
Earth, one must take sphericity into account. The surface waves were character-
ized by their frequency and wave number k. We did not consider boundaries
of the medium other than the free surface, and the frequency was taken as theindependent variable: for each frequency there are only certain discrete wave
numbers k=k
n() for which the boundary conditions could be satised. In-
stead we could have formulated the problem in terms of discrete eigenfrequencies
=n(k)w i t h kthe independent variable. This formalism makes more sense
for the discussion of free oscillations of the Earth, since the medium is bounded.
In the spherical geometry the horizontal wave number kis xed at certain
discrete values by the nite lateral extend of the medium. One often uses theangular wave number linstead of k,w i t h lzero or a positive integer (see Fig.

4.18 Surface waves
Introduction
We have seen before that the solutions of the equations of motion in an un-
bounded, homogeneous, isotropic medium are remarkably simple and that the
total displacement eld due to a stress imbalance is completely accounted for
by propagating PandS-waves. We also discussed how this body wave eld be-
comes increasingly complex in the presence of interfaces, for instance the Earths
(free) surface, and the rst order seismic discontinuities such as the Moho, the410 and 660 km discontinuities, the CMB, and the ICB. The total P- and S-
displacement eld is then composed of up and downgoing SVandSHwaves and
their interaction is controlled by the reection and transmission coecients andby the boundary conditions at the interfaces.
In a bounded medium there is another important class of seismic waves,
thesurface waves ; these are caused by the interaction of body waves with the
free surface. Specically, the interaction of the P-SVeld with the free surface
results in Rayleigh waves (after Lord Rayleigh, 1842-1919) whereas the inter-
action of the SHwave eld with the free surface combines with internal layering
to produce Love waves (after mathematician A. E. H. Love, 1843-1940, who
predicted the existence of these waves in 1911). Later we will see that boththe body waves and the surface waves can be represented by  and are equiva-
lent with  a superposition of the normal modes of free oscillation of the
Earth and it is important to be aware of the intimate relationship between theseseemingly separate descriptions of wave propagation in the Earths interior (see
Table 4.3). All body waves propagating in the Earths interior have counterparts
in both propagating surface waves or standing free oscillations. However, each
representation has distinct advantages for studying specic problems related to
Earths structure and the seismic source.

General properties of surface waves
Surface waves propagate along the Earths surface. This seems like a rather
trivial statement but it has important implications for the amplitude of surface
waves.
The cylindrical expansion of the wave front of the waves along the Earths
surface implies that the energy of surface waves decreases as 1 over r,w i t h rthe
distance between the source and the position of the wave front. The amplitude
of surface waves, related to the square root of the energy, therefore falls of as 1
over
r. In contrast, the geometrical spreading of body waves in the Earths</text>

the space of the homogeneous functions has a dimension 2l +1, hence 0  m  l.

Eq. 2.76 is in standard form and can be solved using a variety of techniques. 
Most commonly, the solutions are found as polynomials P m(cos ). The asso-l 
ciated Legendre Equation reduces to the Legendre Equation in case m =0 . I n 
the latter case, the longitudinal dependence is lost as also Eq. 2.74 reverts to a 
constant. The resulting functions Pl(cos ) have a rotational symmetry around 
the z-axis. They are called zonal functions.

either the positive or negative of the work done which translates in a change of 
sign. Beware!). The potential is a scalar eld which is typically easier to handle 
than a vector eld. And, as we will see below, from the scalar potential we can 
readily derive the vector eld anyway. 
(The gravity eld is a conservative eld so just how the mass m is moved 
from rref to r is not relevant: the work done only depends on the initial and 
nal position.) Following the denition for potential as is common in physics, 
which considers Earth as a potential well  i.e. negative  we get for U: 
r r GM r 1 GM U = g dr =  r dr = GM dr =  (2.5) r2  r2 rrref rref 
Note that  r and dr point in opposite directions. r dr = dr because 
Figure 2.3: By denition, the potential is zero at innity and decreases towards 
the mass. 
U represents the gravitational potential at a distance r from mass M .N o t i c e 
that it is assumed that U () = 0 (see Figure 2.3). 
The potential is the integration over space (either a line, a surface or a 
volume) of the gravity eld. Vice versa, the gravity eld, the gravity force per 
unit mass, is the spatial derivative (gradient) of the potential.

This temperature dependence of viscosity explains why one gets convection 
beneath the cooling lithosphere. As we have discussed before, with typical 
values for the geothermal gradient (e.g., 20 Kkm1) as deduced from surface 
heat ow using Fouriers Law the temperature would quickly rise to near the 
solidus, the temperature where the rock starts to melt. However, we know from 
several observations, for instance from the propagation of S- waves, that the 
temperature is below the solidus in most parts of the mantle (with the possible 
exception in the low velocity zone beneath oceanic and parts of the continental 
lithosphere). So there must be a mechanism that keeps the temperature down, 
or, in other words, that cools the mantle much more eciently than conduction. 
That mechanism is convection . We saw above that the viscosity of the litho-
sphere is very high, and upper mantle viscosity is about 5 orders of magnitude 
lower. This is largely due to the temperature dependence of the viscosity (as 
mentioned above): when the temperature gets closer to the solidus (Tm)t h e 
viscosity drops and the material starts to ow.

Mm F M F = ma = mg = G r2  r  g = m = G r2  r (2.3) 
M and g = /bardblg/bardbl = G r2 . (2.4) 
The acceleration g is the length of a vector g and is by denition always 
positive: g&gt; 0. We dene the vector g as the gravity eld and take, by 
convention, g positive towards the center of the Earth, i.e., in the r direction. 
The gravitational acceleration g was rst determined by Galileo; the magni -
tude of g varies over the surface of Earth but a useful ball-park gure is g=9 . 8 
ms2 (or just 10 ms2)( i n S . I . S y s t ` eme International dUnit es  units). In 
his honor, the unit often used in gravimetry is the Gal.1 G a l = 1 c m s2 =0 . 0 1 
ms2  103g. Gravity anomalies are often expressed in milliGal , i.e., 106g or 
microGal , i.e., 109g. This precision can be achieved by modern gravimeters. 
An alternative unit is the gravity unit, 1 gu = 0.1 mGal = 107g. 
When G was determined by Cavendish in 1778 (with the Cavendish torsion 
balance) the mass of the Earth could be determined and it was found that the 
Earths mean density,   5,500 kgm3, is much larger than the density of rocks 
at the Earths surface. This observations was one of the rst strong indications 
that density must increase substantially towards the center of the Earth. In 
the decades following Cavendish measurement, many measurements were done 
of g at dierent locations on Earth and the variation of g with latitude was 
soon established. In these early days of geodesy one focused on planet wide 
structure; in the mid to late 1800s scientists started to analyze deviations of 
the reference values, i.e. local and regional gravity anomalies.

gravitational potential energy . This energy can be regarded as the work

+ J2 P2(cos )] (2.39) r 
The expressions (2.20), rewritten as (2.38), and (2.39) are identical if we dene 
the scaling factors Jl as follows. Since P0(cos )= 1 , J0 must be 1 because 
GM/r is the far eld term; J1 = 0 if the coordinate origin coincides with the 
center of mass (see above); and J2 is as dened above. This term is of particular 
interest since it describes the oblate shape of the geoid. (The higher order terms 
(J4 , J6 etc.) are smaller by a factor of order 1000 and are not carried through 
here, but they are incorporated in the calculation of the reference spheroid.) 
The nal step towards calculating the reference gravity eld is to add a 
rotational potential. 
Let  = be the angular velocity of rotation around the z-axis. The z 
choice of reference frame is important to get the plus and minus signs right. A 
particle that moves with the rotating earth is inuenced by a centripetal force 
Fcp = ma, which can formally be written in terms of the cross products between 
the angular velocity  and the position vector as m  (  s). This shows 
that the centripetal acceleration points to the rotation axis. The magnitude of 
the force per unit mass is s2 = r2 cos . The source of Fcp is, in fact, the 
Fcpgravitational attraction g (ge + Fcp = g) . T h ee  e c t i v eg r a v i t y ge = g  m m 
(see Figure 2.8). Since we are mainly interested in the radial component (the 
tangential component is very small) we can write ge = g  r2 cos2 .

the rotation of the Earth.

Eqn. (2.53) shows that the gravity eld at the reference spheroid can be 
expressed as some latitude-dependent factor times the gravity acceleration at 
the equator: 
GM 3 geq( =0 ) = 1+ J2  m (2.54) a2 2 
Information about the attening can be derived directly from the relative 
change in gravity from the pole to the equator. 
gpole = geq(1 + f /prime)  f /prime = gpole  geq (2.55) geq 
Eq. 2.55 is called Clairauts theorem3 . The above quadratic equation for 
the gravity as a function of latitude (2.53) forms the basis for the international 
gravity formula. However, this international reference for the reduction of grav-
ity data is based on a derivation that includes some of the higher order terms. 
A typical form is 
g = geq(1 +  sin 2 +  sin2 2) (2.56) 
with the factor of proportionality  and  depending on GM , , a,a n d f . 
The values of these parameters are being determined more and more accurate by 
the increasing amounts of satellite data and as a result the international gravity 
formula is updated regularly. The above expression (2.56) is also a truncated 
series. A closed form expression for the gravity as function of latitude is given 
by the Somigliana Equation4

2.3 The Poisson and Laplace equations 
The gravitational eld of the Earth is caused by its density. The mass distri-
bution of the planet is inherently three-dimensional, but we mortals will always 
only scratch at the surface. The most we can do is measure the gravitational 
acceleration at the Earths surface. However, thanks to a fundamental relation -
ship known as Gausss Theorem5, the link between a surface observable and 
the properties of the whole body in question can be found. Gausss theorem is 
one of a class of theorems in vector analysis that relates integrals of dierent 
types (line, surface, volume integrals) . Stokess, Greens and Gausss theorem 
are fundamental in the study of potential elds. The theorem due to Gauss 
relates the integral over the volume of some property (most generally, a tensor 
T) to a surface integral. It is also called the divergence theorem. Let V be a 
volume bounded by the surface S = V (see Figure 2.9). A dierential patch 
of surface dS can be represented by an outwardly pointing vector with a length 
corresponding to the area of the surface element. In terms of a unit normal 
vector, it is given by n/bardbldS/bardbl.

the Bouguer correction still feels the anomalously low density root (which is 
not corrected for). The Bouguer anomaly is large and negative for a completely 
compensated load. Complete isostasy means also that there is no net mass 
dierence so that the free air gravity anomaly is very small (practically zero). 
Gravity measurements thus contain information about the degree of isostatic 
compensation. 
The correlation between the topography and the measured Bouguer anoma -
lies can be modeled by means of eq. (2.124) and this gives information about 
the exural rigidity, and thus the (eective !) thickness of the elastic plate. The 
diagram below gives the Bouguer anomaly as a function of wave length (i.e. 
topography was subjected to a Fourier transformation). It shows that topog-
raphy with wavelengths less than about 100 km is not compensated (Bouguer 
anomaly is zero). The solid curves are the predictions according to eq. 2.124 
for dierent values of the exural parameter . The parameters used for these

Hydrostatic Figure of Shape of Earth : theoretical shape of the Earth if 
we know density  and rotation  (ellipsoid of revolution). 
We will now derive the shape of the reference spheroid; this concept is very 
important for geodesy since it underlies the denition of the International Grav-
ity Formula. Also, it introduces (zonal, i.e. longitude independent) spherical 
harmonics in a natural way. 
2.2	 Gravitational potential due to nearly spher -
ical body 
How can we determine the shape of the reference spheroid? The attening of 
the earth was already discovered and quantied by the end of the 18th cen-
tury. It was noticed that the distance between a degree of latitude as mea-
sured, for instance with a sextant, diers from that expected from a sphere: 
RE (1  2) /negationslash= RE d,w i t h RE the radius of the Earth, 1 and 2 two dierent 
latitudes (see Figure 2.5). 
Figure 2.5: Ellipticity of the Earth measured by the 
distance between latitudes of the Earth and a sphere. 
In 1743, Clairaut1 showed that the reference spheroid can also be computed 
directly from the measured gravity eld g. The derivation is based on the 
computation of a potential U (P )a tp o i n t P due to a nearly spherical body, and 
it is only valid for points outside (or, in the limit, on the surface of) the body. 
The contribution dU to the gravitational potential at P due to a mass ele-
ment dM at distance q from P is given by 
G dU =  dM	 (2.16) q 
Typically, the potential is expanded in a series. This can be done in two 
ways, which lead to the same results. One can write U (P ) directly in terms 
of the known solutions of Laplaces equation (2U = 0), which are spherical 
harmonics. Alternatively, one can expand the term 1/q and integrate the re-
sulting series term by term. Here, we will do the latter because it gives better

The Gravity Field 
The law of gravitational attraction was formulated by Isaac Newton (1642-1727) 
and published in 1687, that is, about three generations after Galileo had deter-
mined the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration and Kepler had discovered 
his empirical laws describing the orbits of planets. In fact, a strong argument 
for the validity of Newtons laws of motion and gravity was that they could be 
used to derive Keplers laws. 
For our purposes, gravity can be dened as the force exerted on a mass m due 
to the combination of (1) the gravitational attraction of the Earth, with mass M 
or ME and (2) the rotation of the Earth. The latter has two components: the 
centrifugal acceleration due to rotation with angular velocity  and the existence 
of an equatorial bulge that results from the balance between self-gravitation and 
rotation. 
The gravitational force between any two particles with (point) masses M 
at position r0 and m at position r separated by a distance r is an attraction 
along a line joining the particles (see Figure 2.1): 
Mm F = /bardblF/bardbl = Gr2 , (2.1) 
or, in vector form:

terms are, in fact, directly related to (zonal) spherical harmonics. A formal

follows later. The derivation discussed here leads to what is known as MacCul-

gravitational (GMa2) component of gravity at the equator. The value for the 
attening f can be accurately determined from orbital data; in fact within a 
year after the launch of the rst articial satellite  by the soviets  this 
value could be determined with much more accuracy than by estimates given 
by many investigators in the preceding centuries. The geometrical attening 
is small (f =1/298.257  1/300) (but larger than expected from equilibrium 
attening of a rotating body). The dierence between the polar and equatorial 
radii is thus about REf = 6371km /300  21 km.

assumption that the deviation from a sphere is small, and we can thus assume 
the vector from the Earths center to a point at the reference geoid to be of the 
form 
rg  r0 + dr = r0(1 + /epsilon1)o r , w i t h r0 = a , rg  a(1 + /epsilon1) (2.48) 
It can be shown that /epsilon1 can be written as a function of f and latitude as given 
by: rg  a(1  f sin2 ) and (from binomial expansion) rg 2  a2(1 + 2f sin2 ). 
Geoid anomalies, i.e. the geoid highs and lows that people talk about are 
deviations from the reference geoid and they are typically of the order of several 
tens of meters (with a maximum (absolute) value of about 100 m near India), 
which is small (often less than 0.5%) compared to the latitude dependence of 
the radius (see above). So the reference geoid with r = rg according to (2.48) 
does a pretty good job in representing the average geoid. 
Finally, we can determine the gravity eld at the reference geoid with a shape 
as dened by (2.48) calculating the gradient of eqn. (2.42) and substituting the 
position rg dened by (2.48).

ap o i n t m a s s M and becomes less and less sensitive to aspherical variations in 
the shape of the body. This simply implies that if youre interested in small 
scale deviations from spherical symmetry you should not be to far away from 
the surface: i.e. its better to use data from satellites with a relatively low 
orbit. This phenomenon is in fact an example of up (or down)ward continuation, 
which we will discuss more quantitatively formally when introducing spherical 
harmonics.</text>

have been constructed from both surface measurements of gravity (2.112) and 
from satellite observations (2.111). Equat ion (2.112) indicates that relative to 
the gravity anomalies, the coecients of N(, ) are suppressed by a factor of 
1/(l  1). As a result, shorter wavelength features are much more prominent on 
gravity maps. In other words, geoid (and geoid height) maps essentially depict 
the low harmonics of the gravitational eld. A nal note that is relevant for the 
reduction of the gravity data. Gravity data are typically reduced to sea-level, 
which coincides with the geoid and not with the actual reference spheroid. Eq. 
8 can then be used to make the additional correction to the reference spheroid, 
which eectively means that the long wavelength signal is removed. This results 
in very high resolution gravity maps. 
2.7	 Gravity anomalies and the reduction of grav -
ity data 
The combination of the reduced gravity eld and the topography yields impor -
tant information on the mechanical state of the crust and lithosphere. Both 
gravity and topography can be obtained by remote sensing and in many cases 
they form the basis of our knowledge of the dynamical state of planets, such 
as Mars, and natural satellites, such as Earths Moon. Data reduction plays 
an important role in gravity studies since the signal caused by the aspherical 
variation in density that one wants to study are very small compared not only 
to the observed eld but also other eects, such as the inuence of the position 
at which the measurement is made. The following sum shows the various com-
ponents to the observed gravity, with the name of the corresponding corrections 
that should be made shown in parenthesis: 
Observed gravity = attraction of the reference spheroid, PLUS: 
	eects of elevation above sea level (Free Air correction ), which should 
include the elevation (geoid anomaly) of the sea level above the reference 
spheroid 
	eect of normal attracting mass between observation point and sea level 
(Bouguer and terrain correction ) 
	eect of masses that support topographic loads (isostatic correction ) 
	time-dependent changes in Earths gure of shape (tidal correction) 
	eect of changes in the rotation term due to motion of the observation 
point (e.g. when measurements are made from a moving ship. (Eosotv
correction) 
	eects of crust and mantle density anomalies (geology or geodynamic 
processes).</text>

2.5 Spherical harmonics 
We now attempt to solve Laplaces Equation 2U = 0, in spherical coordinates. 
Laplaces equation is obeyed by potential elds outside the sources of the eld. 
Remember how sines and cosines (or in general, exponentials) are often solutions 
to dierential equations, of the form sin kx or cos kx,w h e r e b y k can take any 
integer value. The general solution is any combination of sines and cosines of 
all possible ks with weights that can be determined by satisfying the boundary 
conditions (BCs). The particular solution is constructed by nding a linear 
combination of these (basis) functions with weighting coecients dictated by 
the BCs: it is a series solution. In the Cartesian case they are Fourier Series. 
In Fourier theory, a signal, say a time series s(t), for instance a seismogram, can 
be represented by the superposition of cos and sin functions and weights can be 
found which approximate the signal to be analyzed in a least-squares sense. 
Spherical harmonics are solutions of the spherical Laplaces Equation: they 
are basically an adaption of Fourier analysis to a spherical surface. Just like 
with Fourier series, the superposition of spherical harmonics can be used to 
represent and analyze physical phenomena distributed on the surface on (or 
within) the Earth. Still in analogy with Fourier theory, there exists a sampling 
theorem which requires that sucient data are provided in order to make the 
solution possible. In geophysics, one often talks about (spatial) data coverage , 
which must be adequate. 
We can nd a solution for U of 2U = 0 by the good old trick of separation 
of variables. We look for a solution with the following structure: 
U(r, , )= R(r)P()Q() (2.69) 
Lets take each factor separately. In the following, an outline is given of how 
to nd the solution of this elliptic equation, but working this out rigorously 
requires some more eort than you might be willing to spend. But lets not try 
to lose the physical meaning what we come up with.</text>

account. Also taken into account in recent models is the history of the 
melting and the retreat of the ice cap itself (including the changes in 
shore line with time!). In older models one only investigated the response 
to instantaneous removal of the load. 
Typical values for the dynamic viscosity in the Earths mantle are 1019 Pa s 
for the upper mantle to 1021 Pa s for the lower mantle. The lithosphere is even 
stier, with a typical viscosity of about 1024 (for comparison: water at room 
temperature has a viscosity of about 103 Pa s; this seems small but if youve 
ever dived of a 10 m board you know its not negligible!) 
Things to remember about these values: 
1. very large viscosity in the entire mantle 
2. lower mantle (probably) more viscous than upper mantle, 
3. the dierence is not very large compared to the large value of the viscosity 
itself. 
An important property of viscosity is that it is temperature dependent ;t h e 
viscosity decreases exponentially with increasing temperature as  = 0e30T/T m , 
where Tm is the melting temperature and -30 is an empirical, material dependent 
value.</text>

c c g  
From eq. (2.121) we can see that for very large exural rigidity (or very large 
elastic thickness of the plate) the denominator will predominate the equation 
and the deection will become small (w 0f o r D ); in other words, 
the load has no eect on the depression. The same is true for short wave-
lengths, i.e. for  /lessmuch2(D/ cg)1/4 . In contrast, for very long wave lengths 
( /greatermuch2(D/ cg)1/4) or for a very weak (or thin) plate the maximum depression 
becomes 
ch0 w0  (2.122) m c 
which is the same as for a completely compensated mass (see eq. 2.118). In 
other words, the plate has no strength for long wavelength loads. 
The importance of this formulation is evident if you realize that any topog-
raphy can be described by a (Fourier) series of periodic functions with dierent 
wavelengths. One can thus use Fourier Analysis to investigate the depression or 
compensation of any shape of load. 
Eq. (2.121) can be used to nd expressions for the inuence of exure on 
the Free Air and the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The gravity anomalies depend 
on the exural rigidity in very much the same way as the deection in (2.121).

where bm is the depth to the Moho (i.e. the depressed interface between c and

is at a certain depth (this factor controls, in fact, the downward continuation). 
The important thing to remember is the linear relationship with the topog-
raphy h and the proportionality with D1 . One can follow a similar reasoning 
as above to show that for short wavelengths the free air anomaly is large (and 
positive) and that the Bouguer anomaly is almost zero. This can be explained 
by the fact that the exure is then negligible so that the Bouguer correction suc-
cessfully removes all anomalous structure. However, for long wavelength loads, 
the load is completely compensated so that after correction to zero elevation,</text>

crater will not disappear by ow!) In contrast, loading over large regions, i.e. 
much larger than the distance to the compensation depth, results in the devel-
opment of a compensating root. It is also obvious why the strength (viscosity ) 
of the plate enters the equation. If the viscosity is very small, isostatic equilib -
rium can occur even for very small bodies (consider, for example, the oating 
iceberg!). Will discuss the relationship between gravity anomalies and topog-
raphy in more (theoretical) detail later. We will also see how viscosity adds a 
time dependence to the system. Also this is easy to understand intuitively; low 
strength means that isostatic equilibrium can occur almost instantly (iceberg!), 
but for higher viscosity the relaxation time is much longer. The ow rate of the 
material beneath the supporting plate determines how quickly this plate can 
assume isostatic equilibrium, and this ow rate is a function of viscosity. For 
large viscosity, loading or unloading results in a viscous delay; for instance the 
rebound after deglaciation. 
2.9 Flexure and gravity. 
The bending of the lithosphere combined with its large strength is, in fact, one 
of the compensation mechanisms for isostasy. When we discussed isostasy we 
have seen that the depth to the bottom of the root, which is less dense than 
surrounding rock at the same depth, can be calculated from Archimedes 
Principle : if crustal material with density c replaces denser mantle material 
with density m a mountain range with height h has a compensating root with 
thickness H 
hcH = (2.118) m  c 
This type of compensation is also referred to as Airy Isostasy .I t d o e s 
not account for any strength of the plate. However, it is intuitively obvious 
that the depression H decreases if the strength (or the exural rigidity) of the 
lithosphere increases. The consideration of lithospheric strength for calculates 
based on isostasy is important in particular for the loading on not too long a 
time scale. 
An elegant and very useful way to quantify the eect of exure is by consid -
ering the exure due to a periodic load. Lets consider a periodic load due to to-
pography h with maximum amplitude h0 and wavelength : h = h0 sin(2x/). 
The corresponding load is then given by 
2x V (x)= cgh0 sin (2.119)  
so that the exure equation becomes

The Earths Gravitational 
eld 
2.1	 Global Gravity, Potentials, Figure of the Earth, 
Geoid 
Introduction 
Historically, gravity has played a central role in studies of dynamic processes in 
the Earths interior and is also important in exploration geophysics. The concept 
of gravity is relatively simple, high-precision measurements of the gravity eld 
are inexpensive and quick, and spatial variations in the gravitational acceleration 
give important information about the dynamical state of Earth. However, the 
study of the gravity of Earth is not easy since many corrections have to be 
made to isolate the small signal due to dynamic processes, and the underlying 
theory  although perhaps more elegant than, for instance, in seismology  
is complex. With respect to determining the three-dimensional structure of the 
Earths interior, an additional disadvantage of gravity, indeed, of any potential 
eld, over seismic imaging is that there is larger ambiguity in locating the source 
of gravitational anomalies, in particular in the radial direction. 
In general the gravity signal has a complex origin: the acceleration due to 
gravity, denoted by g,(g in vector notation) is inuenced by topography, as-
pherical variation of density within the Earth, and the Earths rotation. In 
geophysics, our task is to measure, characterize, and interpret the gravity sig-
nal, and the reduction of gravity data is a very important aspect of this scientic 
eld. Gravity measurements are typically given with respect to a certain refer-
ence, which can but does not have to be an equipotential surface .A n i m p o r t a n t 
example of an equipotential surface is the geoid (which itself represents devia-
tions from a reference spheroid ).

need to refer to sea level) minus the reference gravity:

Figure 2.4: F = mU provides the restoring force 
that levels the sea surface along an equipotential sur-
face. 
g would point towards the center of the sphere. (Even in the presence of 
aspherical structure and rotation this is a very good approximation of g. 
However, if the equipotential is an ellipsoid, g = U does not point to 
r = 0; this lies at the origin of the denition of geographic and geocentric 
latitudes.) 
	Using gravity potentials, one can easily prove that the gravitational ac-
celeration of a spherically symmetric mass distribution, at a point outside 
the mass, is the same as the acceleration obtained by concentrating all 
mass at the center of the sphere, i.e., a point mass. 
This seems trivial, but for the use of potential elds to study Earths 
structure it has several important implications: 
1.	Within a spherically symmetric body, the potential, and thus the 
gravitational acceleration g is determined only by the mass between 
the observation point at r and the center of mass. In spherical coor-
dinates: 
r 
g(r)= 4G (r /prime)r /prime2 dr/prime	(2.10) r2
0
This is important in the understanding of the variation of the gravity 
eld as a function of radius within the Earth; 
2. The gravitational potential by itself does not carry information about 
the radial distribution of the mass. We will encounter this later when 
we discuss more properties of potentials, the solutions of the Laplace 
and Poisson equations, and the problem of non-uniqueness in gravity 
interpretations. 
3.	if there are lateral variations in gravitational acceleration on the sur-
face of the sphere, i.e. if the equipotential is not a sphere there must 
be aspherical structure (departure from spherical geometry; can be 
in the shape of the body as well as internal distribution of density 
anomalies).</text>

Intermezzo 2.1 The gradient of the gravitational poten -
tial 
We may easily see this in a more general way by expressing dr (the incremental 
distance along the line joining two point masses) into some set of coordinates, 
using the properties of the dot product and the total derivative of U as follows 
(by our denition, moving in the same direction as g accumulates negative 
potential): 
dU = g dr 
= gxdx gy dy gz dz 
. (2.7) 
By denition, the total derivative of U is given by: 
U U U dU  dx + dy + dz	 (2.8) x y z 
Therefore, the combination of Eq. 2.7 and Eq. 2.8 yields: 
U U U g =  , , = grad U U	 (2.9) x y z 
One can now see that the fact that the gravitational potential is dened to be 
negative means that when mass m approaches the Earth, its potential (energy) 
decreases while its acceleration due to attraction the Earths center increases. 
The slope of the curve is the (positive) value of g, and the minus sign makes 
sure that the gradient U points in the direction of decreasing r, i.e. towards the 
center of mass. (The plus/minus convention is not unique. In the literature one 
often sees U = GM/r and g = U .) 
Some general properties: 
	The gradient of a scalar eld U is a vector that determines the rate and 
direction of change in U . Let an equipotential surface S be the surface of 
constant U and r1 and r2 be positions on that surface (i.e., with U1 = U2 = 
U ). Then, the component of g along S is given by (U2  U1)/(r1  r2)= 0 . 
Thus g = U has no components along S : the eld is perpendicular to 
the equipotential surface. This is always the case, as derived in Intermezzo 
2.2. 
	Since uids cannot sustain shear stress  the shear modulus  =0 , t h e 
forces acting on the uid surface have to be perpendicular to this surface 
in steady state, since any component of a force along the surface of the 
uid would result in ow until this component vanishes. The restoring 
forces are given by F = mU as in Figure 2.4; a uid surface assumes 
an equipotential surface.

Intermezzo 2.7 Non-uniqueness 
One can prove that the solution of Laplaces equation can be uniquely deter-
mined if the boundary conditions are known (i.e. if data coverage at the surface 
is good); in other words, if there are two solutions U1 and U2 that satisfy the 
boundary conditions, U1 and U2 can be shown to be identical. The good news 
here is that once you nd a solution for U of 2U = 0 that satises the BCs 
you do not have to be concerned about the generality of the solution. The bad 
news is (see also point (2) above) that the solution of Laplaces equation does 
not constrain the variations of density within V . This leads to a fundamental 
non-uniqueness which is typical for potentials of force elds. We have seen this 
before: the potential at a point P outside a spherically symmetric body with to-
tal mass M is the same as the potential of a point mass M located in the center 
O. In between O and P the density in the spherical shells can be distributed in 
an innite number of dierent ways, but the potential at P remains the same. 
2.4 Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems 
In Cartesian coordinates we write for 2 (the Laplacian) 
2 2 2 
2 = + + . (2.65) x2 y2 z2 
For the Earth, it is advantageous to use spherical coordinates. These are 
dened as follows (see Figure 2.12): 
 
 x = r sin  cos  
y = r sin  sin  (2.66)  z = r cos

and  in the spherical coordinate 
system. 
where  =0   = co-latitude,  =0  2 = longitude. 
It is very important to realize that, whereas the Cartesian frame is described 
by the immobile unit vectors   z , the unit vectors   are x, y and  r, and  
dependent on the position of the point. They are local axes. At point P, r 
points in the direction of increasing radius from the origin, in the direction of 
increasing colatitude  and  in the direction of increasing longitude .</text>

          <text>2.7. GRA VITY ANOMALIES AND THE REDUCTION OF GRA VITY DATA 69 
Bouguer anomaly 
The free air correction does not correct for any attracting mass between obser-
vation point and sea level. However, on land, at a certain elevation there will 
be attracting mass (even though it is often compensated - isostasy (see below)). 
Instead of estimating the true shape of, say, a mountain on which the measure -
ment is made, one often resorts to what is known as the slab approximation 
in which one simply assumes that the rocks are of innite horizontal extent. 
The Bouguer correction is then given by 
dgB =2Gh (2.115) 
where G is the gravitational constant,  is the assumed mean density of crustal 
rock and h is the height above sea level. For G =6.67  1011 m3kg3s2 and 
 =2, 700 kgm3 we obtain a correction of 1.1106 ms2 per meter of elevation 
(or 0.11 h mgal, h in meter). If the slab approximation is not satisfactory, for 
instance near the top of mountains, on has to apply an additional terrain 
correction . It is straightforward to apply the terrain correction if one has 
access to digital topography/bathymetry data. 
The Bouguer anomaly has to be subtracted, since one wants to remove the 
eects of the extra attraction. The Bouguer correction is typically applied after 
the application of the Free Air correction. Ignoring the terrain correction, the 
Bouguer gravity anomaly is then given by 
gB = gobs  dgFA  g0()  dgB =gFA  dgB (2.116) 
In principle, with the Bouguer anomaly we have accounted for the attraction 
of all rock between observation point and sea level, and gB thus represents 
the gravitational attraction of the material below sea level. Bouguer Anomaly 
maps are typically used to study gravity on continents whereas the Free Air 
Anomaly is more commonly used in oceanic regions. 
Isostasy and isostatic correction 
If the mass between the observation point and sea level is all that contributes 
to the measured gravity one would expect that the Free Air anomaly is large, 
and positive over topography highs (since this mass is unaccounted for) and 
that the Bouguer anomaly decreases to zero. This relationship between the two 
gravity anomalies and topography is indeed what would be obtained in case 
the mass is completely supported by the strength of the plate (i.e. no isostatic 
compensation). In early gravity surveys, however, they found that the Bouguer 
gravity anomaly over mountain ranges was, somewhat surprisingly, large and 
negative. Apparently, a mass deciency remained after the mass above sea level 
was compensated for. In other words, the Bouguer correction subtracted too 
much! This observation in the 19th century lead Airy and Pratt to develop 
the concept of isostasy . In short, isostasy means that at depths larger than 
a certain compensation depth the observed variations in height above sea level</text>

investigate the ow beneath the lithosphere. The rate of ow is dependent on 
the viscosity of the mantle material. Viscosity plays a central role in under -
standing mantle dynamics. Dynamic viscosity can be dened as the ratio of the 
applied (deviatoric) stress and the resultant strain rate; here we mostly consider 
Newtonian viscosity , i.e., a linear relationship between stress and strain rate. 
The unit of viscosity is Pascal Second [Pa s]. 
A classical example of a situation where the history of (un)loading is su-
ciently well known is that of post-glacial rebound . The concept is simple: 
1.	the lithosphere is depressed upon loading of an ice sheet (viscous mantle 
ow away from depression make this possible) 
2.	the ice sheet melts at the end of glaciation and the lithosphere starts 
rebound slowly to its original state (mantle ow towards the decreasing 
depression makes this possible). The uplift is well documented from el-
evated (and dated) shore lines. From the rate of return ow one can 
estimate the value for the viscosity.

the important result that gravity maps typically contain much more detail than 
geoid maps because the spatial attenuation of the higher degree components is 
suppressed.

no longer contribute to lateral variations in pressure. In case of Airy Isostasy 
this is achieved by a compensation root, such that the depth to the interface 
between the loading mass (with constant density) and the rest of the mantle 
varies. This is, in fact Archimedes Law, and a good example of this mechanism 
is the oating iceberg, of which we see only the top above the sea level. In the 
case of Pratt Isostasy the compensation depth does not vary and constant 
pressure is achieved by lateral variations in density. It is now known that both 
mechanisms play a role.

In spectral analysis there are special names for the factors Pl multiplying (s/r)l 
and these are known as Legendre polynomials , which dene the zonal surface 
spherical harmonicsa . 
We will discuss spherical harmonics in detail later but here it is useful to point 
out the similarity between the above expression of the potential U (P )a s a p o w e r 
series of (s/r)a n d c o s  and the lower order spherical-harmonics. Legendre 
polynomials are dened as 
1 dl (2  1)l 
Pl()= (2.23) 2ll! dl 
with  some function. In our case we take  =c o s  so that the superposition of 
the Legendre polynomials describes the variation of the potential with latitude. 
At this stage we ignore variations with longitude. Surface spherical harmonics 
that depend on latitude only are known as zonal spherical harmonics. For 
l =0, 1, 2w eg e t f o r Pl 
P0 (cos ) = 1 (2.24) 
P1 (cos ) = c o s  (2.25) 
3 P2 (cos ) = cos 2   1 (2.26) 2 2 
which are the same as the terms derived by application of the binomial theorem. 
The equivalence between the potential expression in spherical harmonics and 
the one that we are deriving by expanding 1/q is no coincidence: the potential 
U satises Laplaces equation and in a spherical coordinate system spherical 
harmonics are the general solutions of Laplaces equation. 
aSurface spherical harmonics are at the surface of a sphere what a Fourier 
series is to a time series; it can be thought of as a 2D Fourier series which can be 
used to represent any quantity at the surface of a sphere (geoid, temperature, 
seismic wave speed). 
We can get insight in the physics if we look at each term of eq. (2.20) 
separately:

Figure 2.10: Poissons and Laplaces equations. 
If there is no potential source (or sink) enclosed by S Laplaces equation 
should be applied to nd the potential at a point P outside the surface S that 
contains all attracting mass, for instance the potential at the location of a 
satellite. But in the limit, it is also valid at the Earths surface. Similarly, we 
will see that we can use Laplaces equation to describe Earths magnetic eld 
as long as we are outside the region that contains the source for the magnetic 
potential (i.e., Earths core). 
We often have to nd a solution for U of Laplaces equation when only the 
value of U , or its derivatives |U | = g are known at the surface of a sphere. For 
instance if one wants to determine the internal mass distribution of the Earth 
from gravity data. Laplaces equation is easier to solve than Poissons equation. 
In practice one can usually (re)dene the problem in such a way that one can 
use Laplaces equation by integrating over contributions from small volumes dV 
(containing the source of the potential dU , i.e., mass dM ), see Figure 2.11 or 
by using Newtons Law of Gravity along with Laplaces equation in an iterative 
way.

It is important to visualize the behavior of spherical harmonics, as in Figure 
2.14. 
Figure 2.14: Some spherical harmonics. 
Some terminology to remember is that on the basis of the values of l and m 
one identies three types of harmonics. 
0The zonal harmonics are dened tobethose of the form Pl(cos )=  
Pl(cos ). The superposition of these Legendre polynomials describe vari-
ations with latitude; they do not depend on longitude. Zonal harmonics 
vanish at l small circles on the globe, dividing the spheres into latitudinal 
zones. 
The sectorial harmonics are of the form sin(m)Pm

m(cos ). As they vanish at 2m meridians (longitudinal lines, so 
m great circles), they divide the sphere into sectors.

harmonic of a certain degree l and order m vanishes at 2m meridians of 
longitude and on (l  m) parallels of latitude. 
Intermezzo 2.8 Cartesian vs spherical representation 
If you work on a small scale with local gravity anomalies (for instance in explo-
ration geophysics) it is not ecient to use (global) basis functions on a sphere 
because the number of coecients that youd need would simply be too large. 
For example to get resolution of length scales of 100 km (about 1) you need to 
expand up to degree l=360 which with all the combinations 0 &lt;m &lt; l involves 
several hundreds of thousands of coecients (how many exactly?). Instead you 
would use a Fourier Series. The concept is similar to spherical harmonics. A 
Fourier series is just a superposition of harmonic functions (sine and cosine func-
tions) with dierent frequencies (or wave numbers k =2/,  the wavelength): 
2z 2x  gz = constant  sin(kx x)e kxz = constant  sin e x (2.82) x 
(For a 2D eld the expression includes y but is otherwise be very similar.) Or, 
in more general form 
 /bracketleftBig /parenleftBig /parenrightBig /parenleftBig/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig nz /summationdisplay nx nx  gz = an cos + bn sin e x (2.83) x x 
n=0 
(compare to the expression of the spherical harmonics). In this expression the 
up- and downward continuation of the 1D or 2D harmonic eld is controlled by 
an exponential form. The problem with downward continuation becomes imme-
diately clear from the following example. Suppose in a marine gravity expedition 
to investigate density variation in the sediments beneath the sea oor, say, at 2 
km depth, gravity measurements are taken at 10 m intervals on the sea surface 
(x0 species the size of the grid at which the measurements are made). Upon 
downward continuation, the signal associated with the smallest wavelength al-
lowed by such grid spacing would be amplied by a factor of exp(2000 /10) = 
exp(200)  10273 . (The water does not contain any concentrations of mass 
that contribute to the gravity anomalies and integration over the surface enclos -
ing the water mass would add only a constant value to the gravity potential but 
that is irrelevant when studying anomalies, and Laplaces equation can still be 
used.) So it is important to lter the data before the downward continuation 
so that information is maintained only on length scales that are not too much 
smaller than the distance over which the downward continuation has to take 
place. 
In other words the degree l gives the total number of nodal lines and the 
order m controls how this number is distributed over nodal meridians and nodal 
parallels. The higher the degree and order the ner the detail that can be 
represented, but increasing l and m only makes sense if data coverage is sucient 
to constrain the coecients of the polynomials. 
A dierent rendering is given in Figure 2.15. 
An important property follows from the depth dependence of the solution: 
From eqn. (2.80) we can see that (1) the amplitude of all terms will decrease 
with increasing distance from the origin (i.e., the internal source of the potential)</text>

A moment of inertia of a rigid body is dened with respect to a certain axis of 
rotation.

and for a continuum: I = r2 dM
The moment of inertia is a tensor quantity

Note: we revert to matrix notation and manipulation of tensors. I is a second-
order tensor.

Figure 2.19: Airy isostasy. 
Assuming Airy Isostasy and some constant density for crustal rock one can 
compute H(x, y) from known (digital) topography h(x, y) and thus correct for 
the mass deciency. This results in the Isostatic Anomaly . If all is done cor-
rectly the isostatic anomaly isolates the small signal due to the density anomaly 
that is not compensated (local geology, or geodynamic processes). 
2.8	 Correlation between gravity anomalies and 
topography. 
The correlation between Bouguer and Free Air anomalies on the one hand and 
topography on the other thus contains information as to what level the topog-
raphy is isostatically compensated. 
In the case of Airy Isostasy it is obvious that the compensating root causes 
the mass deciency that results in a negative Bouguer anomaly. If the topog-
raphy is compensated the mass excess above sea level is canceled by the mass 
deciency below it, and as a consequence the Free Air Anomaly is small; usually, 
it is not zero since the attracting mass is closer to the observation point and is 
thus less attenuated than the compensating signal of the mass deciency so that 
some correlation between the Free Air Anomaly and topography can remain. 
Apart from this eect (which also plays a role near the edges of topographic 
features), the Free air anomaly is close to zero and the Bouguer anomaly large 
and negative when the topography is completely compensated isostatically (also 
referred to as in isostatic equilibrium). 
In case the topography is NOT compensated, the Free air anomaly is large 
and positive, and the Bouguer anomaly zero. 
(This also depends on the length scale of the load and the strength of the 
supporting plate). 
Whether or not a topographic load is or can be compensated depends largely 
on the strength (and the thickness) of the supporting plate and on the length 
scale of the loading structure. Intuitively it is obvious that small objects are not 
compensated because the lithospheric plate is strong enough to carry the load. 
This explains why impact craters can survive over very long periods of time!

to an aspherical density distribution is close to that of a spherical body 
(i.e., a point mass in O). 
2. s cos d M represents a torque of mass  distance, which also underlies 
the denition of the center of mass rcm = rd M/ dM .I n o u r c a s e , 
we have chosen O as the center of mass and rcm = 0 with respect to O. 
Another way to see that this integral must vanish is to realize that the 
integration over dM is essentially an integration over  between 0 and 
2 and that cos  =  cos(   ). Integration over  takes s cos  back 2 
and forth over the line between O and P (within the body) with equal 
contributions from each side of O,s i n c e O is the center of mass. 
3.	s2 dM represents the torque of a distance squared and a mass, which 
underlies the denition of the moment of inertia (recall that for a ho-
mogeneous sphere with radius R and mass M the moment of inertia is 0.4 
MR2). The moment of inertia is dened as I = r2 dM . When talking 
about moments of inertia one must identify the axis of rotation. We can 
understand the meaning of the third integral by introducing a coordinate 
2system x, y, z so that s =(x, y, z), s2 = x2 + y2 + zso that s2 dM = 
(y2	(x2(x2 + y2 + z2) dM =1/2[ + z2) dM + (x2 + z2) dM + + y2) dM ] 
(y2 (x2	(x2and by realizing that + z2) dM, + z2) dM and + y2) dM 
are the moments of inertia around the x-, y-, and z-axis respectively. See 
Intermezzo 2.5 for more on moments of inertia. 
With the moments of inertia dened as in the box we can rewrite the third 
term in the potential equation 
G G  s 2 dM =  2r3 (A + B + C)	 (2.27) r3 
4.	s2 sin2 d M . Here, s sin  projects s on a plane perpendicular to OP and 
this integral thus represents the moment of inertia of the body around OP . 
This moment is often denoted by I. 
Eq. (2.20) can then be rewritten as 
GM G U (P )=   2r3 ( A +B+C  3I)	 (2.28) r 
which is known as MacCullaghs formula . 
At face value this seems to be the result of a straightforward and rather 
boring derivation, but it does reveal some interesting and important properties 
of the potential and the related eld. Equation (2.20) basically shows that in 
absence of rotation the gravitational attraction of an irregular body has two 
contributions; the rst is the attraction of a point mass located at the center of 
gravity, the second term depends on the moments of inertia around the principal 
axes, which in turn depend completely on the shape of the body, or, more 
precisely, on the deviations of the shape from a perfect sphere. This second</text>

It is useful to dene the directional derivative of U in the direction of a at 
point p as: 
a DAU (p)= U (p)  (2.14) /bardbla/bardbl 
From this relation we infer that the gradient vector U (p)a t p gives the 
direction in which the change of U is maximum. Now let S be an equipotential

dCi (t0 ) will dene a plane tangent to the surface S at point p. Therefore, the dt gradient vector U is perpendicular to the surface S of constant U .O r : t h e

of the sea level with a smooth variation in latitude that best ts the geoid

1outg (r, l)= a l+1(l +1 ) rl+1 U (l) (2.88) r 
What is the gravity due to a thin sheet of mass of spherical harmonic degree 
l? Lets represent this as a sheet with vanishing thickness, and call (l)t h e m a s s 
density per unit area. This way we can work at constant r and use the results 
for spherical symmetry. We know from Gausss law that the ux through any 
surface enclosing a bit of mass is equal to the total enclosed mass (times 4G). 
So constructing a box around a patch of surface S with area dS, enclosing a bit 
of mass dM , we can deduce that 
gout  gin =4G(l) (2.89) 
On this shell  give it a radius a, we can use Eqs. 2.88 to nd gout = 
U (l)(l +1 )/a and gin = U (l)l/a,a n d s o l v e f o r U (l)u s i n g E q . 2 . 8 9a s U (l)= 
4G(l)a/(2l + 1). Plugging this into Eqs. 2.88 again we get for the gravity in-
and outside this mass distribution

Length scales 
Measurements of gravitational attraction are  as we have seen  useful in the 
determination of the shape and rotational properties of the Earth. This is im-
portant for geodesy. In addition, they also provide information about aspherical 
density variations in the lithosphere and mantle (important for understanding 
dynamical processes, interpretation of seismic images, or for nding mineral de-
posits). However, before gravity measurements can be used for interpretation 
several corrections will have to be made: the data reductions plays an important 
role in gravimetry since the signal pertinent to the structures we are interested 
in is very small.</text>

Only the bold corrections will be discussed here. The tidal correction is 
small, but must be accounted for when high precision data are required. The 
application of the dierent corrections is illustrated by a simple example of a 
small density anomaly located in a topography high that is isostatically com-
pensated. See series of diagrams. 
Free Air Anomaly 
So far it has been assumed that measurements at sea level (i.e. the actual geoid) 
were available. This is often not the case. If, for instance, g is measured on the 
land surface at an altitude h one has to make the following correction : 
hgdgFA = 2 (2.113) r 
For g at sea level this correction amounts to dgFA = 0.3086h mgal or 
0.3086h  105 ms2 (h in meter). Note that this assumes no mass between 
the observer and sea level, hence the name free-air correction. The eect of 
ellipticity is often ignored, but one can use r = Req(1  fsin2). Note: per 
meter elevation this correction equals 3.1  106 ms2  3.1  107g:t h i s i s 
on the limit of the precision that can be attained by eld instruments, which 
shows that uncertainties in elevation are a limiting factor in the precision that 
can be achieved. (A realistic uncertainty is 1 mgal). 
Make sure the correction is applied correctly, since there can be confusion 
about the sign of the correction, which depends on the denition of the poten-
tial. The objective of the correction is to compensate for the decrease in gravity 
attraction with increasing distance from the source (center of the Earth). For-
mally, given the minus sign in (2.114), the correction has to be subtracted, but 
it is not uncommon to take the correction as the positive number in which case 
it will have to be added. (Just bear in mind that you have to make the measured 
value larger by adding gravity so it compares directly to the reference value at 
the same height; alternatively, you can make the reference value smaller if you 
are above sea level; if you are in a submarine you will, of course, have to do the 
opposite). 
The Free Air anomaly is then obtained by the correction for height above 
sea level and by subtraction of the reference gravity eld 
gFA = gobs  dgFA  g0()=(gobs +0.3086h  103)  g0() (2.114) 
(Note that there could be a component due to the fact that the sea level ( the 
geoid) does not coincide with the reference spheroid; an additional correction 
can then be made to take out the extra gravity anomaly. One can simply apply 
(2.114) and use h/prime = h + N as the elevation, which is equivalent to adding a 
correction to g0() so that it represents the reference value at the geoid. This 
correction is not important if the variation in geoid is small across the survey 
region because then the correction is the same for all data points.)</text>

Lets take a step back and get a feel for the dierent length scales and 
probable sources involved. If we use a spherical harmonic expansion of the 
eld U we can see that its the up- or downward continuation of the eld and 
its dependence on r and degree l that controls the behavior of the solution at 
dierent depths (or radius) (remember Eq. 2.87). 
With increasing r from the source the amplitude of the surface harmonics 
become smaller and smaller, and the decay in amplitude (spatial attenuation) 
is stronger for the higher degrees l (i.e., the small-scale structures). 
Table 2.2 gives and idea about the relationship between length scales, the 
probable source regions, and where the measurements have to be taken.

The free-air gravity anomaly 
Lets assume that the geoid height N with respect to the spheroid is due to an 
anomalous mass dM.I f dM represents excess mass, the equipotential is warped 
outwards and there will be a geoid high (N&gt; 0); conversely, if dM represents 
a mass deciency, N&lt; 0 and there will be a geoid low. 
We can represent the two potentials as follows: the actual geoid, U(r, , ) 
is an equipotential surface with the same potential W0 as the reference geoid U0, 
only 
U(r, , )= U0(r, , )+ U(r, , ) (2.91) 
We dene the free-air gravity anomaly as the gravity g(P)m e a s u r e d a t p o i n t 
P minus the gravity at the projection Q of this point onto the reference geoid 
at r0, g0(Q). Neglecting the small dierences in direction, we can write for the 
magnitudes: 
g = g(P)  g0(Q) (2.92)

Suppose we measure g everywhere at the surface, and sum the results. What 
we get is the ux of the gravity eld 
g  dS.	 (2.60) 
V 
At this point, we can already predict that if S is the surface enclosing the 
Earth, the ux of the gravity eld should be dierent from zero, and further -
more, that it should have something to do with the density distribution within 
the planet. Why? Because the gravitational eld lines all point towards the 
center of mass. If the ux was zero, the eld would be said to be solenoidal 
. Unlike the magnetic eld the gravity eld is essentially a monopole. For the 
magnetic eld, eld lines both leave and enter the spherical surface because 
the Earth has a positive and a negative pole. The gravitational eld is only 
solenoidal in regions not occupied by mass. 
Anyway, well start working with Eq. 2.60 and see what we come up with. 
On the one hand (we use Eq. 2.58 and Eq. 2.59)6 , 
g  n dS =   g dV =    Ud V =  2Ud V . (2.61) 
V V V	 V 
On the other hand (we use the denition of the dot product and Eq. 2.59, 
and dene gn as the component of g normal to dS): 
g  n dS =  gn dS = 4r2 GM = 4G d V . (2.62) r2 V V	 V 
Weve assumed that S is a spherical surface, but the derivation will work for 
any surface. Equating Eq. 2.61 and 2.62, we can state that 
2U (r)= 4G(r) Poissons Equation	 (2.63) 
and in the homogeneous case 
2U (r)= 0 Laplaces Equation	 (2.64) 
The interpretation in terms of sources and sinks of the potential elds and 
its relation with the eld lines is summarized in Figure 2.10: 
Poissons equation is a fundamental result. It implies 
1. that the total mass of a body (say, Earth) can be determined from mea-
surements of U = g at the surface (see Eq. 2.62), and 
2.	no information is required about how exactly the density is distributed 
within V 
6 Note that the identity 2U =   U is true for scalar elds, but for a vector eld V we 
should have written 2 V = (  V)    (  V).</text>

Radial dependence: R(r) 
It turns out that the functions satisfying Laplaces Equation belong to a special 
class of homogeneous7 harmonic8 functions. A rst property of homogeneous 
functions that can be used to our advantage is that in general, a homogeneous 
function can be written in two dierent forms: 
U1(r, , )= r lYl(, ) (2.70) 
1 /parenrightbigg(l+1) 
U2(r, , )= Yl(, ) (2.71) r 
This, of course, gives the form of our radial function: 
lrR(r)= /parenleftbig 1 /parenrightbigl+1 (2.72) 
r 
The two alternatives R(r)= rl and R(r)=( 1 /r)l+1 describe the behavior 
of U for an external and internal eld, respectively (in- and outside the mass 
distribution). Whether to use R(r)= rl and R(r)= ( 1/r)l+1 depends on the 
problem youre working on and on the boundary conditions. If the problem 
requires a nite value for U at r = 0 than we need to use R(r)= rl . However if 
we require U 0f o r r  then we have to use R(r)= ( 1/r)l+1 . The latter 
is appropriate for representing the potential outside the surface that encloses 
all sources of potential, such as the gravity potential U = GM r1 . However, 
both are needed when we describe the magnetic potential at point r due to an 
internal and external eld. 
Longitudinal dependence: Q() 
Substitution of Eq. 2.69 into Laplaces equation with R(r) given by Eq. 2.72, 
and dividing Eq. 2.69 out again yields an equation in which -a n d -derivatives 
occur on separate sides of the equation sign. For arbitrary  and  this must 
mean: 
d2
d2 Q
 = constant , (2.73) Q 
which is best solved by calling the constant m2 and solving for Q as: 
Q()= A cos m + B sin m. (2.74) 
Indeed, all possible constants A and B give valid solutions, and m must be a 
positive integer. 
7 A homogenous function f of degree n satises f(tx, ty, tz)= tn f(x, y, z).
8 By denition, a function which satises Laplaces equation is called harmonic.</text>

Why? Hint: use the above diagram and consider the symmetry of the problem) 
The geopotential can now be written as 
GM G 1 1 U (r, )=  + J2Ma2 3 cos 2    r 22 sin2  (2.41) r r3 2 2 2 
which describes the contribution to the potential due to the central mass, the 
oblate shape of the Earth (i.e. attening due to rotation), and the rotation 
itself. 
We can also write the geopotential in terms of the latitude by substituting 
(sin  =c o s ): 
GM G 3 1 U (r, )=  + r3 (C  A) sin2   1  r 22 cos 2  (2.42) r 2 2 2 
We now want to use this result to nd an expression for the gravity potential 
and acceleration at the surface of the (reference) spheroid. The attening is 
determined from the geopotential by dening the equipotential U0,t h e s u r f a c e 
of constant U . 
Since U0 is an equipotential, U must be the same (U0) for a point at the 
pole and at the equator. We take c f o rt h e p o l a rr a d i u sa n d a for the equatorial 
radius and write: 
U0,pole = U (c, 90) = U0,equator = U (a, 0) (2.43)

Which basically shows that the geometrical attening f as dened by the 
relative dierence between the polar and equatorial radius is related to the 
ellipticity coecient J2 and the ratio m between the rotational (a2)t ot h e</text>

inertia I around any general axis (here OP ) can be expressed as a linear com-
bination of the moments of inertia around the principal axes. Let l2 , m2,a n d 
n2 be the squares of the cosines of the angle of the line OP with the x-, y-, and 
z-axis, respectively. With l2 + m2 + n2 =1 w e c a n w r i t e I = l2A+ m2B+ n2C

So far we have not been specic about the shape of the body, but for the 
Earth it is relevant to consider rotational geometry so that A = B /negationslash=C . T h i s 
leads to: 
I= A + ( C  A)n 2 (2.34) 
Here, n =c o s  with  the angle between OP and the z-axis, that is  is the 
co-latitude .( =9 0  ,w h e r e  is the latitude ). 
I= A + ( C  A) cos 2  (2.35) 
and 
GM G 3 U(P )=  + r3 (C  A) cos 2   1 (2.36) r 2 2 
It is customary to write the dierence in moments of inertia as a fraction J2 
of Ma2,w i t h a the Earths radius at the equator. 
C  A= J2Ma2 (2.37) 
so that 
U(P )=  GM + GJ2Ma2 3 cos 2   1 (2.38) r r3 2 2 
J2 is a measure of ellipticity; for a sphere C = A, J2 = 0, and the potential 
U(P ) reduces to the expression of the gravitational potential of a body with 
spherical symmetry.</text>

So at this arbitrary point P on the geoid, the gravity anomaly g due to 
the anomalous mass arises from two sources: the direct contribution dgm due 
to the extra acceleration by the mass dM itself, and an additional contribution 
dgh that arises from the fact that g is measured on height N above the reference 
spheroid. The latter term is essentially a free air correction , similar to the 
one one has to apply when referring the measurement (on a mountain, say) to 
the actual geoid (sea level). 
Note that Eq. (2.95) contains the boundary conditions of 2U =0 . T h e 
geoid height N at any point depends on the total eect of mass excesses and de-
ciencies over the Earth. N can be determined uniquely at any point ( , )f r o m

 this was rst done by Stokes (1849)  but it does not uniquely constrain 
the distribution of masses.

spherical harmonic expansion of N(, )i nt e r m s o f U(, )o r g(, ). 
Its convenient to just give the coecients of Eq. 2.86 since the basic ex-
pressions are the same. Lets see how that notation would work for eq. (2.86): 
UA GM Am
l=  (2.103) BmUB a l 
Note that the subscripts A and B are used to label the coecients of the 
cos m and sin m parts, respectively. Note also that we have now taken the 
factor GM al as the scaling factor of the coecients. 
We can also expand the potential U0 on the reference spheroid: 
mU0,A =  GM Al (2.104) U0,B a 0 
(Note that we did not drop the m , even though m = 0 for the zonal harmonics 
used for the reference spheroid. We just require the coecient A m to be zero l 
for m /negationslash= 0. By doing this we can keep the equations simple.)</text>

the silicates (assume for simplicity that the composition of the slab is the same as 
the mantle  which is not the case). Within the slab the phase transformation from Ol 
 Sp will occur at a shallower depth than in the ambient mantle. 
This means that for depths just less than 410 km the density within the slab is locally higher than in the ambient mantle, and this, in fact, gives rise to an 
extra negative buoyancy force that helps the slab to subduct (it is an important 
plate driving force). At 660 km the dynamical eect of the phase change is the 
opposite. Inside and in the direct vicinity of the slab the phase boundary will 
be depressed; consequently, the density in the slab is less than the density of 
the ambient mantle which creates a buoyancy force that will resist the further penetration of the slab. 
Figure 5.23: Eects of phase transformations on downgoing 
slabs. 
From the diagram it is clear that the steeper the Clapeyron slope, the 
stronger the dynamic eects. On the one hand, a lot of laboratory research 
is focused on estimating the slopes of these phase boundaries in experimental 
conditions. On the other hand, and that brings us back to seismology, seis
mologists attempt to estimate the topography of the seismic discontinuity and thus constrain the clapeyron slope and asses the dynamical implications. Im
portant classes of seismological data that have the potential to constrain both 
the sharpness of and the depth to the discontinuities are reections and phase 
(mode) transformations. An example of a useful reection is the underside re
ection of the PKIKPPKIKP , or PKP
DFPKP DF, or just PP, at the 660 
km discontinuity. 
Since the paths of the PP phase and the P P are almost similar except 660
for near the reection point, the dierence in travel time gives direct information about the depth to the interface. Another example is the use of SS underside 
reections S
660S. Apart from proper phase identication (usually one applies 
stacking techniques to suppress signal to noise) the major problem with such 
techniques is that one has to make assumptions about upper mantle structure</text>

          <text>192 CHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS 
Heat sources 
There are several possibilities for the source of heat within the earth: 
1. Original or primordial heat; this is the release of heat due to the 
cooling of the Earth. The amount of heat released by this process can be 
estimated by calculating the heat released by a change in temperature of 1
 at constant pressure. This depends on the specic heat , CP which 
is the energy that is needed to heat up 1 kg of material by 1 (i.e., its a 
material property). 
We can do a quick calculation to nd out how much heat would be released by dropping the temperature of the mantle by 1
C (Lets for now ignore 
latent heat due to phase changes): 
	Mantle; for silicates: CP = 7.1  102 Jkg1C1; the mass of the 
mantle is about 4.1 1024 kg 
	Core; for iron: CP = 4.6 102 Jkg1C1; the mass of the core is 
about 1.9 1024 kg 
For  T = 1C this gives  E = 3.71027J. In absence of any other sources 
for heat production, the observed global heat ux of 4.2 1013W can thus 
be maintained by a cooling rate of 4.2 1013 [W] divided by 3.7 1027 [J]= 
1.11014Cs1 . 
In other words, since the formation of Earth, 4.5 Ga ago, the average 
temperature would have dropped by  T 1, 500C. Note that the actual 
cooling rate is much lower because there are sources of heat production. 
2. Gravitational potential energy released by the transfer of material from 
the surface to depths. Imagine dropping a small volume of rock from the 
crust to the core. The gravitational potential energy released would be: 
E = gh, with g 10ms2 and h = 3 106 m 
silicates 3103 kgm3 and iron 7103 kgm3, so that   = 4103 
kgm3 . 
E 1.2 1011 Jm3 . 
The present-day heat ux would thus be equivalent to dropping a volume of about 350 m
3 every second. This is equal to dropping a 22 m thick 
surface layer every million years. 
So even if a small amount of net dierentiation were taking place within the earth, this would be a signicant source of heat! 
3. Radioactive decay: for an order of magnitude calculation, see Stacey 6.3.1. 
The bottom line is that for the Earth a very signicant fraction of heat loss can be attributed to radioactive decay (primarily of Uranium (U), Thorium (Th) and Potassium (K). More, in fact, than can be accounted 
for by heat production of the MORB source.</text>

reection and phase conversion of high frequency seismic waves was used as evidence for compositional layering and against eects of a phase change. However, experimental rock mechanics in the late eighties demonstrated that phase 
changes can occur over suciently narrow depth ranges to explain the seismic 
observations, see attached phase diagrams by Ito and Takahashi (JGR, 1989). 
The phase changes in the (Mg, Fe) silicates play an important role in man

with z the depth below the surface and x the distance from the ridge. The 
variation in temperature in a direction perpendicular to the ridge (i.e., in the 
spreading direction x) is usually much smaller than the vertical gradient. In that 
case, the heat conduction in the x direction can be ignored, and the cooling of 
a piece of lithosphere that moves along with the plate, away from the ridge, can 
be described by a 1D diusion equation: 
 2T  T =  (5.10) t z2 
(i.e., the observer, or the frame of reference, moves with the plate velocity 
u = x/t). Note that, in this formulation, the time plays a dual role: it is used 
as the time at which we describe the temperature at some depth z, but this also 
relates to the age of the ocean oor, and thus to the distance x = ut from the

we assume that the bending is due to an end load V0 and a bending moment 
M0 applied at the tip of the plate. As a result of the bending moment the slope 
dw/dx = 0 at x = 0 (note the dierence with the seamount example where this 
slope was set to zero!). The important outcome is, again, that the parameter 
of our interest, the elastic thickness h, can be determined from the shape of the 
plate, in vertical cross section, i.e. from the bathymetry prole w(x)!, in the 
subduction zone region, without having to know the magnitudes of V0 and M0. 
We can use the same basic equation (5.33) and the general solution (5.34) 
(with A = B = 0 for the reason given above) 
x x w(x) = e x
C cos + Dsin (5.38)   
but the boundary conditions are dierent and so are the constants C and 
D. At x = 0 the bending moment6 is M0 and the end load V0. It can be 
shown (Turcotte &amp; Schubert) that the expressions for C and D are given by 
2 M02 
C = (V0 + M0) and D = (5.39) 2D  2D 
so that the solution for bending due to an end load and an applied bending 
moment can be written as 
2ex/   x x w(x) = ( V0 + M0)cos  M0 sin (5.40) 2D  
We proceed as above to nd the locations of the rst zero crossing and the 
fore bulge, or outer rise . 
w(x) = 0  tan(x0/) = 1 + V0/M0 (5.41) 
dw/dx = 0  tan(xb/) = 1 2M0/V0 (5.42) 
In contrast to similar solutions for the sea mount loading case, these ex
pressions for x0 and xb still depend on V0 and M0. In general V0 and M0 
are unknown. They can, however, be eliminated, and we can show the dependence of w(x) on x
0 and xb, which can both be estimated from the nathymetry 
prole. A perhaps less obvious but elegant way of doing this is to work out tan(1/(x
0 xb)). Using sine and cosine rules (see Turcotte &amp; Schubert, 3.17) 
one nds that 
x0 tan xb = 1 (5.43)  
so that x0 xb = (/4 + n), n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . For n = 0 one nds that 
 = 4(x0 xb)/, so that the elastic thickness h can be determined if one can 
measure the horizontal distance between x0 and xb. 
6At this moment, it is important that you go back to the original derivation of the plate 
equation in Turcotte &amp; Schubert and realize they obtained their results with denite choices 
as to the signs of applied loads and moments  hence the negative signs.</text>

Near the ridge crest the observed heat ow is signicantly lower than the

heat ow seems to level o at around 46 mW/m2, which suggests that beyond 
a certain age of the lithosphere the rate of conductive cooling either becomes 
smaller or the cooling is partly o set by additional heat production. Possible

shows that m(r) is, in fact, the mass of the Earth less the mass of the shell 
between point r and the radius of the Earth REarth. The mass of the Earth 
is assumed to be know from astronomical data and is an important constraint 
on the density gradient. So the only unknown in (5.55) is the density (a) 
between r and REarth. We can nd a solution of (5.54) by working from the 
Earths surface to larger depths: at the surface, the density of crustal rock is fairly well known so that the density gradient can be determined for the crust. 
This gradient is then used to estimate the density at the base of the crust, 
which is then used to calculate the mass of the crustal shell. In this way we can carry on the dierentiation and integration to larger depths. As already 
mentioned, and explicit in (5.55), any solution of (5.54) must agree with the 
total mass of the Earth, as well as with the moment of inertia, which forms the 
second independent constraint on the solution. This process can only be applied 
in regions where d/dr = d/dr = 0, and in this form one must also require 
/T = 0, but  as mentioned above  there are approximations to (5.54) 
that take small deviations from adiabatic compression into account. 
Application of the (modied) Adams-Williamson equation by, amongst oth
ers, Bullen resulted in pretty good density models for the Earth. 
The upper mantle transition zone 
In 1952, Birch realized that both the density gradient and the wave speed gra
dients in the Earth mantle between 200 and 900 km in depth are larger than 
expected from adiabatic compression only, see the abstract of his famous paper (attached). This means that either dc/dr = 0 or d/dr = 0, or both. The man
tle region where the density and wave speed gradient are larger than predicted from adiabatic compression alone is loosely referred to as the (upper mantle) transition zone 
7 . 
There is no consensus yet on which one applies to the Earth but it is now 
clear that d/dr = 0 is a sucient condition and is probably the most important 
factor to explain the excess density. Birch suggested that phase transformations 
in the Mg, Fe silicate system (Mg , Fe)2SiO4 (olivine, spinel) and (Mg , Fe)SiO3 
(pyroxene) could explain the increase in density required to explain the non
adiabatic parts of the density and wave speed gradients. We now know that 
phase transformations do indeed occur in this mineral system at depths of about 
410 and 660 km. Initially the sharpness of the interface as deduced from the 
7This is the original denition of the transition zone. Later, it became common to use the 
term transition zone in a more restricted to indicate the mantle region between the 410 and 
660 km discontinuities. In terms of mantle processes (convection, slab behavior) the original 
denition is more useful.</text>

Important implications : The exural parameter can be determined from 
the location of either the zero crossing or the location of the forebulge. No need 
to know the magnitude of the load! The depression is narrow for small , which 
means either a weak plate or a small elastic thickness (or both); for a plate with large elastic thickness, or with a large rigidity the depression is very wide. In 
the limit of very large D the depression is innitely wide but the amplitude w
0, 
is zero  no depression at all! Once  is known, information about the central 
load can be obtained from Eq. (5.37) 
Note: the actual situation can be complicated by lateral variations in thick
ness h, fracturing of the lithosphere (which inuences D), compositional layering 
within the elastic lithosphere, and by the fact that loads have a nite dimensions. 
Flexure at deep sea trench 
With increasing distance from the MOR, or with increasing time since formation at the MOR, the oceanic lithosphere becomes increasingly more dense and if the 
conditions are right
5 this gravitational instability results in the subduction of the 
old oceanic plate. The gravitational instability is signicant for lithospheric ages 
of about 70 Ma and more. We will consider here the situation after subduction 
itself has been established; in general the plate will not just sink vertically into the mantlebut it will bend into the trench region.

5Even for old oceanic lithosphere the stresses caused by the increasing negative buoyancy 
of the plate are not large enough to break the plate and initiate subduction. The actual cause 
of subduction initiation is still not well understood, but the presence of pre-existing zones of weakness (e.g. a fracture zone, thinned lithosphere due to magmatic activity  e.g. an island 
arc) or the initiation of bending by means of sediment loading have all been proposed (and 
investigated) as explanation for the triggering of subduction. Figure by MIT OCW.</text>

In other words, there is a unique way to bend a laterally homogeneous elastic 
plate so that it goes through the two points ( x0, 0) and ( xb, wb) with the condi
tion that the slope is zero at x = xb. The example of the Mariana trench shown 
in Figure 5.20 demonstrates the excellent t between the observed bathymetry 
and the prediction after Eq. (5.44) (for a best tting elastic thickness h as 
determined from the exural parameter calculated from equation (5.43). 
Bending stress and seismicity 
Many shallow earthquakes occur in near the convergent margin. Both in the overriding plates as well as in the subducting plate. The latter can be attributed 
to the bending stresses in the plate. The bending stress is given by Eq. (5.30). 
Earthquakes are most likely to occur in the region where the bending stress is 
largest (thats the place where the elastic plate is most likely to fail if there are Figure by MIT OCW.</text>

5.2 Heat ow, geothermal gradient, diusion 
The rate of heat ow by conduction across a thin layer depends on 
1. the temperature contrast across the layer ( T) 
2. the thickness of the layer ( z) 
3. the ease with which heat transfer takes place (which is determined by 
the thermal conductivity k). The thinner the layer and the larger the 
temperature contrast (i.e., the larger the gradient in temperature), the 
larger the heat ow. 
In other words, the heat ow q at a point is proportional to the temperature 
gradient at that point. This is summarized in Fouriers Law of conduction : 
T q =  (5.1) z kT  k z 
where the minus sign indicates that the direction of heat ow is from high 
to low tempertaures (i.e., in the opposite dirtection of z if z is depth.). (For 
simplicity we talk here about a 1D ow of heat, but Fouriers Law is also true 
for a general 3D medium). 
We can use this denition to formulate the conduction (or diusion) equa
tion, which basically describes how the temperature per unit volume of material 
changes with time. This change depends on 
1. the amount of heat that ows in or out of the system which is described 
by the divergence of heat ow 
2. the amount of heat produced within the volume (denoted by the density 
of heat sources A) 
3. the coupling between this change in heat and a change in temperature 
(which is controlled by the specic heat) 
The thermal diusion equation is given by: 
T CP =  q + A (5.2) t 
Or: the change in heat content with time equals the divergence of the heat 
ow (into and out of the volume) and the generation of heat within the volume. 
Combined with Fouriers Law the diusion equation can be written as 
T CP =  (kT) + A = k 2T + A (5.3) t 
In a situation of steady-state the diusion equation transforms to the ex
pression of the geotherm , the variation of temperature with depth in the Earth:

Intermezzo 5.1 lithospheric thickness from surface wave 
dispersion 
In the seismology classes we have discussed how dispersion curves can be used 
to extract information about lithospheric structure from the seismic data. The thickness of the high wave speed  lid, the structure above the mantle low ve
locity zone, as determined from surface wave dispersion across parts of oceanic 
lithosphere of dierent age appears to plot roughly between the 900
 and 1100C 
isotherms, or at about T = 0.80.9Tm (see Figure 5.10). So the seismic litho
sphere seems to correspond roughly to thermal lithosphere. In other words; in 
short time scales  i.e. the time scale appropriate for seismic wave transmission 
(sec - min)  most of the thermal lithosphere may act as an elastic medium, 
whereas on the longer time scale the stress can be relaxed by steady state creep, in particular in the bottom half of the plate. However, a word of caution is in order since this interpretation of the dispersion data has been disputed. Anderson 
and co-workers argue (see, for instance, Anderson &amp; Regan, GRL, vol. 10, pp. 
183-186, 1983) that interpretation of surface wave dispersion assuming isotropic media results in a signicant overestimation of the lid thickness. They have investigated the eects of seismic anisotropy and claim that the fast isotropic LID extends to a much cooler isotherm, at T 
 450  600C, than the base of 
the thermal lithosphere.

If there is no heat production (by radioactive decay), i.e., A = 0, then 
the temperature increases linearly with increasing depth. If A = 0 then the 
temperature/depth prole is given by a second-order polymomial in z. In other 
words, the curvature of the temperature-depth prole depends on the amount 
of heat production (and the conductivity). 
Figure 5.2: Heat production causes nonlinear geotherms. 
A typical value for the geotherm is of order 20 Kkm1, and with a value 
for the conductivity k = 3.0 Wm1K1 this gives a heat ow per unit area of 
about 60 mWm2 (which is close to the global average, see table above). If the 
temperature increases according to this gradient, at a depth of about 60 km a temperature of about 1500 K is reached, which is close to or higher than the 
melting temperature of most rocks. However, we know from the propagation 
of shear waves that the Earths mantle behaves as a solid on short time scales ( &gt; 0). So what is going on here? Actually, there are two things that are 
important: 
1. At some depth the geothermal gradient is no longer controlled by con
ductive cooling and adiabatic compression takes over. The temperature gradient for adiabatic compression (i.e., the change of temperature due to a change of pressure alone, without exchange of heat with its invi
ronment) is much smaller than the gradient in the conducting thermal 
boundary layer. 
2. With increasing pressure the temperature required for melting also in
creases. In fact it can be shown that with increasing depth in Earths 
mantle, the actual temperature increases (from about 0C at the sur
face to about 3,500  1000C at the core-mantle boundary CMB) but 
the melting temperature Tm increases even more as a result of the in
creasing pressure. Consequently, at increasing depth in the mantle the ratio of T over T
m (the homologous temperature ) decreases. At even 
larger depth, in Earths core, the temperature continues to increase, but the melting temperature for pure iron drops (pure chemical compounds 
 such as pure iron  typically have a lower melting temperature then</text>

          <text>5.3. THERMAL STRUCTURE OF THE OCEANIC LITHOSPHERE 199 
The assumption that the oceanic lithosphere cools by conduction alone is 
pretty good, except at small distances from the ridge where hydrothermal cir
culation (convection!) is signicant. We will come back to this when we discuss 
heat ow. There is a still ongoing debate as to the success of the simple cooling 
model described below for large distances from the ridge (or, equavalently, for 
large times since spreading began). This is important since it relates to the 
scale of mantle convection; can the cooling oceanic lithosphere be considered as the Thermal Boundary Layer (across which heat transfer occurs primarily by 
conduction) of a large scale convection cell or is small scale convection required 
to explain some of the observations discussed below? See the recent Nature paper by Stein and Stein, Nature 359, 123129, 1992. 
Cooling of oceanic lithosphere: the half-space model 
The variation of temperature with time and depth can be obtained from solving 
the instant cooling problem: material at a certain temperature Tm (or T0 in 
Turcotte and Schubert) is instantly brought to the surface temperature where 
it is exposed to surface temperature Ts (see cartoons below; for a full derivation, 
see Turcotte and Schubert).

An important aspect of the derivations given below is that the thickness 
of the elastic lithosphere can often be determined from surprisingly simple ob
servations and without knowledge of the actual load. In addition, we will see 
that if the bending of the lithosphere is relatively small the entire mechanical 
lithosphere behaves as an elastic plate; if the bending is large some of the de
formation takes place by means of ductile creep and the part of the lithosphere 
that behaves elastically is thinner than the mechanical lithosphere proper. 
5.5.1 Basic theory 
To derive the equations for the bending of a thin elastic plate we need to 
1. apply laws for equilibrium: sum of the forces is zero and the sum of all 
moments is zero: F = 0 and M = 0 
2. dene the constitutive relations between applied stress  and resultant 
strain  
3. assume that the deection w L, the typical length scale of the system, 
and h, the thickness of the elastic plate L. The latter criterion (#3) is 
to justify the use of linear elasticity . 
Figure 5.14: Deection of a plate under a load. 
In a 2D situation, i.e., there is no change in the direction of y, the bending 
of a homogeneous, elastic plate due to a load V (x) can be described by the 
fourth-order dierential equation that is well known in elastic beam theory in engineering: 
d4w d2w D + P = V (x) (5.28) dx4 dx2 
with w = w(x) the deection, i.e., the vertical displacement of the plate, 
which is, in fact, the ocean depth(!), D the exural rigidity , and P a horizontal 
force. 
The exural rigidity depends on elastic parameters of the plate as well as on 
the thickness of the plate:

occurs because the cool lithosphere reduces the temperature of the underlying 
material which can then become part of the plate. On the diagram the open 
circles depict estimates of lithospheric thickness from surface wave dispersion 
data. Note that even though the plate is moving and the resultant geometry 
is two dimensional the half space cooling model works for an observer that is 
moving along with the plate. Beneath this moving reference point the plate is 
getting thicker and thicker. Figure by MIT OCW.</text>

The actual cooling rate of the Earth depends not only on these sources of heat, 
but also on the eciency at which heat is transferred to and lost at the Earths 
surface. 
How does heat get out of the system?

oceanic lithosphere.

discussions it is fair to say that these models have been very successful in pre
dicting heat ow, topography, gravity, and have thus played a major role in the understanding of the evolution of oceanic lithosphere with time. The typi
cal game that is played by such successful theoretical models, in particular ones 
that are so simple (= easy + fast to compute) as the cooling models is to predict 
the rst order behavior of a certain process and take out that trend from the 
observed data. In this case, the residual signal is then analyzed for deviations from the simple conduction model. The addition of heat to the system (for in
stance by plumes) could cause anomalous topography (thermal topography) 
whereas the eect of deep dynamic processes in the Earths mantle can cause 
dynamic topography. Removing the eects of conduction alone thus helps to 
isolate the structural signal due to other processes. This is likely to continue, 
perhaps with the new model (GHD1) by Stein &amp; Stein (1992) instead of that 
by earlier workers; since regional dierences are often larger than the residual 
between observed and predicted heat ow and depth curves one could question how useful a (set of) simple model(s) is (are). For instance, if one allows the 
thermal expansion coecient as a free parameters in the inversions, one might 
also look into allowing lateral variation of this coecient. Davies and Richards argue that the success of the cooling models in predicting the topography and 
heat ow over almost the entire age range of oceanic lithosphere (they attribute 
the deviations to the choice of the wrong sites for data  which is rather ques-
tionable) indicates that conductive cooling is the predominant mode of heat loss 
of most of the lithosphere (about 85% of the heat lost from the mantle ows 
through oceanic lithosphere), which suggests that the lithosphere is the bound
ary layer of a convective system with a typical scale length dened by the plates 
(plate-scale ow). They follow up on a concept tossed up by Brad Hager that the oceanic lithosphere organizes the ow in the deeper mantle. It is for argu
ments such as these that question as to whether or not the topography levels 
o after, say, 80Ma, in not merely of interest to statisticians. It is quite clear 
that the details of the bathymetry of the oceans still contain signicant keys to 
the understanding of dynamic processes in the deep interior of the Earth. One of the remarkable aspects of the square root of time variation of ocean depth is 
that it does a very good job in describing the true bathymetry, even at distances 
pretty close to the MORs. This indicates that conduction alone is likely to be the predominant mode of heat loss, even close to the MOR. The absence of any 
substantial dynamic topography near the ridge crest suggests that the active, 
convection related upwellings are not signicant. The upwelling is passive: the 
plates are pulled apart (mainly as the result of the gravitational force, the slab 
pull, acting on the subducting slabs) and the asthenospheric mantle beneath 
the ridges ows to shallower depth to ll the vacancy. In doing so the material 
will cross the solidus , the temperature at which rock melts (which decreases 
with decreasing depth) so that the material melts. This process is known as de
compression melting (see Turcotte &amp; Schubert, Chapter 1), which results in 
a shallow magma chamber beneath the MOR instead of a very deep plume-like 
conduit.</text>

The constants A D can be determined from the boundary conditions. In 
this case we can apply the general requirement that w(x) 0 for x   so that 
A = B = 0, and we also require that the plate be horizontal directly beneath

From this we can now begin to see the power of this method. The deection 
w as a function of distance is an oscillation with period x/ and with an expo
nentially decaying amplitude. This indicates that we can determine  directly 
from observed bathymetry proles w(x), and from equations (5.36) and (5.29) 
we can determine the elastic thickness h under the assumption of values for the 
elastic parameters (Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio). The exural param

the deection (as a function of the strength of the plate). 
The constant C can be determined from the deection at x = 0 and it can

Intermezzo 5.2 Plate-cooling Models 
There are two basic models for the description of the cooling oceanic lithosphere, 
a cooling of a uniform half space and the cooling of a layer with some nite 
thickness. The former is referred to as the half-space model (rst described 
in this context by Turcotte and Oxburgh, 1967); The latter is also known as the 
plate model (rst described by McKenzie, 1967). 
Both models assume that the plate moves as a unit, that the surface of the 
lithosphere is at an isothermal condition of 0C, and that the main method of 
heat transfer is conduction (a good assumption, except at the ridge crest). The 
major dierence (apart from the mathematical description) is that in the half-space model the base of the lithosphere is dened by an isotherm (for instance 1300
C) so that plate thickness can grow indenitely whereas in the plate model 
the plate thickness is limited by some thickness L. 
The two models give the same results for young plates near the ridge crest, i.e. 
the thickness is such that the bottom of the lithosphere is not yet sensed. 
However, they dier signicantly after 50 Myr for heat ow predictions and 70 
Myr for topography predictions. It was realized early on that at large distances 
from the ridge (i.e., large ages of the lithosphere) the oceans were not as deep 
and heat ow not as low as expected from the half-space cooling model (there 
does not seem to be much thermal dierence between lithosphere of 80 and 160 Myr of age). The plate model was proposed to get a better t to the data, but its conceptual disadvantage is that it does not explain why the lithosphere has a maximum thickness of L. The half space model makes more sense physically 
and its mathematical description is more straightforward. Therefore, we will 
discuss only the half space cooling model, but we will also give some relevant 
comparisons with the plate model. 
5.4 Thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere 
Bathymetry 
The second thermal eect on the evolution of the cooling lithosphere is its 
subsidence or the increase in ocean depth with increasing age. This happens 
because when the mantle material cools and solidies after melting at the MOR 
it is heavier than the density of the underlying mantle. Since we have seen that the plate thickens with increasing distance from the MOR and if the plate is 
not allowed to subside this would result in the increase in hydrostatic pressure 
at some reference depth. In other words the plate would not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. But when the lithosphere subsides, denser material will be replaced 
by lighter water so that the total weight of a certain column remains the same. 
The requirement of hydrostatic equilibrium gives us the lateral variation in 
depth to the ocean oor. Application of the isostatic principle gives us the 
correct ocean oor topography. 
Let w and m represent the density of water ( w 1000 kg/m3) and the 
mantle/asthenosphere ( m 3300 kg/m3), respectively, and (z, t) the density 
as a function of time and depth within the cooling plate. The system is in hydrostatic equilibrium when the total hydrostatic pressure of a column under 
the ridge crest at depth w + zL is the same as the pressure of a column of the</text>

From a dimensional analysis of the diusion equation 
T =  2T (5.7) t 
we see that the diusivity  has the dimension of length2 time1 . We can 
now dene a diusion length L as L =

If a temperature change occurs at some time t0, then after a characteristic 
time interval  it will have propagated over a distance L =  through the 
medium with diusivity . Similarly, it takes a time l2/ for a temperature 
change to propagate over a distance l. 
5.3 Thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere 
Introduction 
The thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere can be constrained by the 
observations of: 
1. Heat ow 
2. Topography (depth of the ocean basins) 
3. Gravity (density depends inversely on temperature) 
4. Seismic velocities (  = (T),  = (T)); in particular, surface waves are 
sensitive to radial variations in wave speed and surface wave dispersion 
is one of the classical methods to constrain the structure of oceanic (and continental) lithosphere. 
In the following we address how the heat ow and the depth of ocean basins 
is related to the cooling of oceanic lithosphere. 
The conductive cooling of oceanic lithosphere when it spreads away from the 
mid-oceanic ridge can be described by the diusion equation 
T =  2T + A (5.8) t 
We will simplify this equation by (1) ignoring the heat production by ra
diocative decay, so that A = 0 (this is reasonable for the oceanic lithosphere 
since the basalts do not contain a signicant fraction of major radio-isotopes Uranium, Potassium, and Thorium)
1, and (2) by assuming a 2D geometry so 
that we can ignore the variations in the y direction. The latter assumption is 
justied for regions away from fracture zones. With these simplications the diusion equation would reduce to a

with E the Youngs modulus and  the Poissons ratio, which depend on the 
elastic moduli  and  (See Fowler, Appendix 2). 
The bending of the plate results in bending (or ber) stresses within the 
plate, xx; depending on how the plate is bent, one half of the plate will be in 
compression while the other half is in extension. In the center of the plate the 
stress goes to zero; this denes the neutral line or plane . If the bending is not 
too large, the stress will increase linearly with increasing distance z away from 
the neutral line and reaches a maximum at z = h/2. The bending stress is 
also dependent on the elastic properties of the plate and on how much the plate 
is bent; xx elastic moduli z curvature, with the curvature dened as the 
(negative of the) change in the slope d/dx(dw/dx ):

This stress is important to understand where the plate may break (seis

Equation (5.28) is generally applicable to problems involving the bending of 
a thin elastic plate. It plays a fundamental role in the study of such problems

post-glacial rebound, the proper modeling of isostasy, and in the understanding Figure by MIT OCW.</text>

change occurs at smaller pressure if the temperature increase; i.e., the Clapey
ron slope for the transition from Sp  Pv+Mw is negative! Its a so called 
endothermic phase change: upon phase transformation the material looses heat 
and cools down. In contrast, Ol  Sp transition that marks the phase change 
at about 410 km depth has a positive Clapeyron slope and is exothermic, i.e. there is a release of latent heat upon transformation and the material will warm up. 
What does this mean for dynamics and plate driving forces? In the diagram 
I have given schematically the stability elds of Ol, Sp, and Pv+Mw, and the 
boundaries between them (i.e. the Clapeyron slopes). If one would descend into 
the mantle along an average mantle geotherm one would cross the Clapeyron slope where Ol and Sp coexist at a pressure that corresponds to a depth of about 
410 km and the phase line between Sp and Pv+Mw at a pressure corresponding 
to about 660 km depth. Consider now the situation that a slab of cold, former 
oceanic lithosphere subducts into the mantle and crosses the stability elds of</text>

of seismicity. In class we will look at two important cases: (1) loading by sea 
mounts, and (2) bending at the trench. 
Before we can do this we have to look a bit more carefully at the dynamics of 
the system. If we apply bending theory to study lithospheric exure we have to realize that if some load V or moment M causes a deection of the plate there 
will be a hydrostatic restoring force owing to the replacement of heavy mantle material by lighter water or crustal rock. The magnitude of the restoring force 
can easily be found by applying the isostasy principle and the eective load is 
thus the applied load minus the restoring force (all per unit length in the y 
direction): V = V
applied wg with w the deection and g the gravitational 
acceleration. This formulation also makes clear that lithospheric exure is in fact 
a compensation mechanism for isostasy! For oceanic lithosphere   = m w 
and for continental exure   = m c. The bending equation that we will 
consider is thus: 
d4w d2w D + P + wg = V (x) (5.32) dx4 dx2 
Loading by sea mounts 
Lets assume a line load in the form of a chain of sea mounts, for example 
Hawaii. 
Figure 5.16: Deection of an elastic plate under a line load. 
Let V0 be the load applied at x = 0 and V (x) = 0 for x = 0. With this 
approximation we can solve the homogeneous form of (5.32) for x &gt; 0 and take 
the mirror image to get the deection w(x) for x &lt; 0. If we also ignore the 
horizontal applied force P we have to solve

5.1 Heat ow 
Thermally controlled processes within Earth include volcanism, intrusion of 
igneous rocks, metamorphism, convection within the mantle and outer core, 
and plate tectonics. The global heat ow can be measured by measuring the 
temperature gradient everywhere at the surface of the Earth. This gives us an 
estimate of the mean rate of heat loss of the Earth, which can be broken up into 
various components (Table 7.3 in Fowler):

The amount of heat lost through the ocean basins in enormous!  up to 73%! 
(The oceans cover about 60% of the Earths surface). This was a famous paradox 
before the discovery of plate tectonics. It was well known that the abundance 
of radioactive elements (which are a source of heat through radioactive decay) 
in the ocean basins was much lower than that in the continents. So what causes 
the signicantly higher heat ow in the oceans? With the discovery of plate 
tectonics it was realized that most of the heat loss occurs through the cooling 
and creation of oceanic lithosphere. The mean rate of plate generation therefore depends on the balance between the rate of heat production within the Earth 
and the rate of heat loss at the surface. 
In this course we will address some of the basic concepts of heat ow and 
Earths thermal structure, and we will discuss in some detail the cooling of 
oceanic lithosphere and the implications of Earth thermal structure for mantle 
convection.

location where the stress is largest we must solve 
dxx d d2w  d3w = 0 = 0 = (5.45) dx  dx dx2 dx3 
This gives the location x where the stress is a maximum (or minimum!) and 
substitution in (5.30), with the exural parameter D determined as above from 
the bathymetry prole, then gives the amplitude of the maximum stress. If this stress exceeds the strength of the plate, failure will occur. The mechanism of the earthquake depends on the location relative to the neutral stress plane.

Derivation of density variation with depth : 
Adams-Williamson Equation 
How about density? Can the radial variation in density and the elastic moduli 
be constrained independently from the travel time curves? Indirectly, yes! This 
was rst shown by Adams and Williamson in 1923. Here, we will only give the basic principles and, in particular, discuss its implications for our understanding 
of the Earths physical state. 
The fundamental result I want you to remember is that the Adams-Williamson 
equation relates the gradient in density to radial variations in seismic wave speed 
(through the seismic parameter ) and the mass of the Earth, which quantities 
are assumed to be known, but that this result only applies to homogeneous 
regions of the same physical phase. 
From the travel time curves we can determine radial variations of P and 
S-wave speed, (r) and (r).

where , , , , , and  are all functions of radius: (r), (r), (r), (r), 
(r), and ( r). 
The seismic parameter is also known as the bulk sound velocity , as the 
counterpart of the shear velocity . (Notice that the incompressibility  in 
these equations is, in fact, the adiabatic incompressibility or bulk modulus

the (as yet unknown) lithospheric thickness. The lithosphere is thus heavier 
than the underlying half space! (Assuming, as we do here, that the lithosphere has the same composition as the asthenosphere). This increase in density is due 
to cooling; the relationship between the change in density due to a change in

are much larger than the transit time of a seismic wave.) The aim is to show 
that not only the density-normalized shear and bulk moduli can be determined, but also the density itself (and thus  and ). 
In general, variations in density can be due to changes in pressure ( dP), 
temperature ( dT), composition ( dc) and physical phase ( d), which can be 
written (in gradient form) as: 
d  dP  dT  dc  d = + + + (5.49) dr P dr T dr c dr  dr 
For a homogeneous medium (same composition and phase throughout) this 
equation simplies to; 
d  dP  dT = + (5.50) dr P dr T dr 
For the sake of the argument I will concentrate on the eect of adiabatic 
compression, i.e., there is no variation of density with temperature. 
d  dP (5.51) dr  P dr 
This assumption seems reasonable for most of the convecting mantle, and 
leads to the original Adams-Williamson equation. For thermal boundary layers 
such as the lithosphere and the lowermost mantle (D), and - in case of layered 
convection  a TBL between the upper and the lower mantle, an additional gradient term has to be taken into account, and this modication has been 
applied by Birch in his famous 1952 paper (see Fowler 
4.3, and Stacey 5.3.1). 
For adiabatic self-compression the increase in pressure that results from the 
descent from radius r +dr to radius r is due to the weight of the overlying shell 
with thickness r, so that the pressure gradient can be written as: 
dP m(r) = g, with g = G (5.52) dr r2 
The other term in Eq. (5.51), the pressure derivative of the density, can be 
evaluated in terms of the adiabatic bulk modulus S: 
increase in pressure dP dP S = fractional change in volume = dV/V = d (5.53) 
Substitution of (5.52) and (5.53) in (5.51) and using (5.48) gives the Adams-
Williamson equation :

5.5 Bending, or exure, of thin elastic plate 
Introduction 
We have seen that upon rifting away from the MOR the lithosphere thickens (the 
base of the thermal lithosphere is dened by an isotherm, usually Tm 1300C) 
and subsides, and that the cooled lithosphere is more dense than the underlying mantle. In other words, it forms a gravitationally unstable layer. Why does it stay atop the asthenosphere instead of sinking down to produce a more stable 
density stratication? That is because upon cooling the lithosphere also acquires 
strength . Its weight is supported by its strength; the lithosphere can sustain 
large stresses before it breaks. The initiation of subduction is therefore less trivial than one might think and our understanding of this process is still far from complete. 
The strength of the lithosphere has important implications: 
1. it means that the lithosphere can support loads, for instance by seamounts 
2. the lithosphere, at least the top half of it, is seismogenic 
3. lithosphere does not simply sink into the mantle at trenches, but it bends 
or exes, so that it inuences the style of deformation along convergent 
plate boundaries. 
Investigation of the bending or exure of the plate provides important in
formation about the mechanical properties of the lithospheric plate. We will see 
that the nature of the bending is largely dependent on the exural rigidity , 
which in turn depends on the elastic parameters of the lithosphere and on the 
elastic thickness of the plate. Figure by MIT OCW.</text>

time, T(z,) = Ts, i.e., the whole system has cooled so that the temperature 
is the same as the surface temperature everywhere. 
For the Earth we can set Ts = 0C so that T  Tmerf(),  = z/(2
t) 
for most practical purposes; but the above formulas are readily applicable to 
other boundary layer problems (for instance to the cooling of the lithosphere on 
Venus where the surface temperature is much than that at Earth). 
Examples of the geothermal gradient as a function of lithospheric age are 
given in the diagram below (from Davies &amp; Richards, Mantle Convection

From this, one can readily see that if the thermal lithosphere is bounded by 
isotherms, the thickness of the lithosphere increases as 
t. For back-of-the-

between the Earths surface and the discontinuity, and these corrections are not 
always reliable. The time dierence between the reections at the surface and the discontinuity contains information about the depth to the interface, whereas 
the frequency content of both the direct and the reected phase gives informa
tion about the sharpness of the interface. Also phase conversions can be used! 
This line of research is still very active, and there is some consensus only about 
the very long wave length variations in depth to the seismic discontinuities.</text>

show evidence of strong magnetic activity. Some T Tauri stars have spectra that 
include forbidden lines, which occur in low-density gas and are the signature 
of a gaseous nebula. Rapid uctuations in ultraviolet and x-ray emissions are 
common. They also tend to show strong infrared emission and have spectra 
with silicon lines indicating that they are surrounded by dust clouds. 
T Tauri stars are associated with strong solar winds and high luminosities. 
It is thought that our sun probably passed through a T Tauri stage in its early 
evolution, and that the volatile elements in the inner solar system were blown 
away during this stage. 
1.4 Planetary Formation 
Condensation and Cooling 
The most widely accepted cosmogonical (formation) theory is that of V. Safronov, 
who was the rst to hypothesize that the solar system initially accreted from 
a nebular cloud that evolved from a sphere to a disk. While details of solar 
system formation models dier, a common premise is that the planets formed 
from particle growth in an initially tenuous dust-gas nebula. The mechanism to 
trigger the initial collapse of the nebula has been argued and hypotheses range 
from uniform gravitational collapse, to galactic spiral density waves, to catas-
trophic suggestions such as a supernova in the solar neighborhood. A supernova, 
though a low probability event, is supported by the discovery of micro-diamonds 
in cosmic dust. These imply that the solar system environs achieved high pres-
sures due to passage of severe shock waves that would accompany only an event 
of this intensity. The problem with the supernova hypothesis is that it would 
imply that solar system formation is not a common phenomenon, which runs 
contrary to current thought. 
There are a number of scenarios for planetary growth. It is possible that 
the planets accumulated from small moon-sized bodies, called planetesimals , 
by infrequent encounters. Or instead accumulation may have occurred from 
groups of bodies that collectively became gravitationally unstable. It is not clear 
whether planetary accumulation occurred in a gaseous or gas-free environment. 
In a gaseous nebula temperatures tend to be homogeneous, but as gas clears 
due to the solar wind and condensation into dust grains the opacity of the 
nebula decreases signicantly. During this time the system establishes a large 
temperature gradient. 
It is generally accepted that the planets accreted from a nebula with a com-
position similar to that of the sun, i.e., made mostly of hydrogen. The slowly-
rotating nebula had a pressure and temperature distribution that decreased ra-
dially outward. The density of the nebula was probably not very great. Model 
estimates of typical pressures in the vicinity of Earths orbit generally fall in 
the range of 10-100 Pa but these are not very well constrained. The disk must 
have cooled primarily by radiation, condensing out dust particles that were 
initially of composed of refractory elements. These high temperature conden -</text>

1.6 Radioactive Decay 
Radioactivity was discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896 and it ultimately had 
profound implications for the evolution of the Earth. By that time sedimentary 
layering in outcrops was somewhat understood, at least to the point where 
it was known that observed sedimentary strata must have taken hundreds of 
millions of years to accumulate. At that point the only known energy sources 
available to the sun and Earth, i.e. the energy associated with gravitational 
collapse, allowed a maximum age of 25 Ma. For about 3 decades geologists 
debated whether to accept this age. The argument became moot due to the 
discovery of radioactivity. From the point of view of the evolution of the Earth, 
the discovery of radioactivity had two eects: 
(1) it removed the short-term age limit of the Earth by providing a mecha -
nism for long-term heating (here we are referring to the internal heat that drives 
mantle convection and thus plate motions); and 
(2) it provided a means of determining absolute dates for rocks. 
The stability of elements with respect to decay is related to the relative 
numbers of protons and neutrons. If the numbers of these are not approximately 
equal then material is prone to decay. Elements with the same number of protons 
but a dierent number of neutrons are called isotopes . 
Radioactive decay occurs because some of the mass of an atom is held in 
binding energy. If there is too much binding energy (and quantum mechanics 
is required to assess what exactly constitutes too much) then the nucleus will 
decay spontaneously to lower the energy state. Induced nuclear reactions, say 
by bombarding large atoms with neutrons, may also be used to achieve the lower 
energy state. Radioactive decay can occur by three classes of mechanisms: 
alpha decay  the escape of a helium nucleus, 
beta decay  the escape of an electron or positron, or 
gamma decay  the emission of gamma radiation. 
Radioactive decay is described with a simple rate law. The change in the 
total number N of radioactive particles over the time interval dt is therefore: 
dN = N, (1.15) dt 
where the minus sign indicates that activity decreases with time, and N repre-
sents the average number of particles that decay per second. The constant  is 
based on the probability of a particular decay mechanism operating in an atom 
of a given element. We may rewrite 
dN = dt, (1.16) N 
and integrating both sides of (1.16) we nd 
ln N = t + c, (1.17)</text>

and howardites . Because they are basaltic in composition they are believed to 
come from parent bodies that were large enough to have dierentiated (melted) 
to produce a crust. The main belt asteroid Vesta is the best compositional 
analog for the eucrites. 
Meteorites from Mars 
Shergottites are named after a meteorite that fell in 1865 in Shergotty, which 
is located in the northeastern Indian state of Bihar, which borders Nepal. Unlike 
the eucrites, their pyroxene and plagioclase mineralogy is strikingly similar to 
terrestrial basalts. They also have small amounts of the hydrous mineral amphi -
bole kaersutite, whereas eucrites show no evidence of water in their minerals, and 
they have some magnetite, which contains iron in oxidized form (Fe+3), whereas 
eucrites contain only reduced iron. Their pyroxene crystals are elongated and 
arranged horizontally the way such crystals would accumulate after settling to 
the bottom of a magma chamber. Such igneous rocks are called cumulates . 
Two other types of cumulate meteorites have hydrous and oxidized minerals like 
the shergottites, these are the nakhlites , which contain the dark-green to black 
pyroxene mineral augite, and a unique meteorite that fell in Chassigny, France 
called chassignite , which contains mostly olivine. Together these three types 
of meteorites are referred to as the SNC (pronounced snick) meteorites. The 
parent body for the SNC meteorites is conjectured to be Mars. 
Meteorites from the Moon 
Some meteorites have breccias with white clasts in darker matrix, like lunar 
rocks. These lunar origin of some meteorites was established without con-
tention because we have many lunar samples which provided close geochemical 
and petrological matches to the meteorite samples. The identication of lunar 
meteorites opened the door to dynamical studies that subsequently established 
the possibility that meteorites can viably be deposited at Earth from Mars. 
Ureilites 
These meteorites contain olivine and pigeonite, and the matrix contains graphite 
or diamond. The carbon content suggests a link with carbonaceous chondrites. 
1.13 Irons and Stony-Irons 
Iron and stony iron meteorites make up several percent of the meteorite popu-
lation. They constitute 4% of the meteorites that fall to Earth but are the most 
common nd since they look so much dierent than the Earths crustal rocks. 
Stony iron meteorites consist of roughly equal parts of rock and iron, with 
the rock component consisting of olivine, the most common mantle material, 
and minor amounts of other silicate phases. Stony irons make up only about 
1% of meteorites that fall to Earth.</text>

          <slideno>18</slideno>
          <text>21 1.13. IRONS AND STONY-IRONS 
The metallic component of these meteorites is predominantly iron with nickel 
in solid solution averaging usually about 10% but sometimes up to 20%. There 
are also smaller amounts of sulde, graphite and occasionally silicate inclusions. 
Within the iron there are two metal phases: the body-centered cubic ()f o r m 
kamacite (5.5% nickel) and the face-centered cubic () taenite (variable, but 
usually &gt; 27% nickel) 
These phases occur because iron and nickel form a solid solution when mixed 
and are not completely miscible as they begin to cool. The iron and nickel are 
structurally similar but not identical. At high temperatures they exchange 
freely because the crystal lattice is expanded. But when cooling sets in their 
slight dierences produce lattices with slightly dierent structures. At a point 
the total energy of the system is minimized by segregating the elements into 2 
separate lattices: one rich in iron and the other poor. To minimize the mismatch 
where the lattices connect, newly formed lattices form in preferred orientations 
called exsolution lamellae. 
Approximately 75% of iron meteorites exhibit a crystal pattern called Wid-
manstatten structure , which is the term used for these exsolution lamellae. 
The pattern is observed by taking a meteorite that is cut and polished and 
dipping it in acid. Because this pattern forms when an iron-nickel alloy crystal -
lizes, it is an indication that some asteroids were at least partially melted after 
they formed. In fact, the details of the pattern tell the cooling history of the 
meteorite parent body from which it was derived. From the iron-nickel phase 
diagram we can see the evolution of the relative amounts of iron and nickel 
that crystallized as the iron cooled. And from the variations in composition 
across Widmanstatten structure boundaries it is possible to constrain the rate 
of cooling. 
Iron Meteorites and Planetary Cores 
In the iron-nickel system, equilibrium is maintained at temperatures above 
650C. Below 350C crystal structures are frozen in. So the Widmanstat -
ten structures yield the cooling rate in this temperature range. In the mete-
orites wide diusion boundaries correspond to slow cooling and narrow diusion 
boundaries correspond to rapid cooling. In the meteorites there are iron-nickel 
crystals that grown with lengths of up to several centimeters, which correspond 
to rates of 0.4  40/Ma. So the Widmanstatten structures yield cooling rates 
of many millions of years. For a cooling periods in this range radii of meteorite 
parent bodies in the range 100200 km are implied. 
Identication of a signicant metallic group within the meteorites made it 
the natural presumed component of dense planetary cores. It is known from 
the masses of the planets that the interiors are (in most cases), after correcting 
for the eect of self-compression, denser than rock. An iron-nickel alloy with 
approximate meteoritic proportions is the leading candidate for the dense com-
ponent. Shock wave experiments indicate that seismic wave velocities in the 
Earths deep interior are consistent with a predominantly iron composition and 
thus support the contention.</text>

After that, main focus on determining 3D structure. Mid seventies: pio-
n e e r i n g w o r k a t M I T ( K . A k i ,M .N . T o k s oz) and Harvard (A. Dziewonski) 
results in rst realistic 3D models of seismic propagation speed in Earths 
mantle. 
How does this work? Just a brief account will do here: modern seismometers 
measure the three spatial components of this ground motion over in a wide 
frequency band and with a large dynamic range. What is important in these 
records is (1) the large variation in frequency (body waves and surface waves) 
and (2) the arrival of distinct seismic phases (such as P and S waves). For 
imaging purposes the dierence in frequency controls the amount of detail that 
can be investigated with certain seismic data (resolution) whereas the dierent 
phases sample dierent parts of the Earths interior. Whats important for now 
is how the travel times measured from such records can tell us something about 
Earths radial structure. 
Let us assume for the time being that we know where and when an earth-
quake occurred (for instance from local damage reports). One can then construct 
so-called record sections, in which the seismograms are sorted according to the 
distance of the station to the earthquake epicentre (location at the surface). 
This distance (epicentral distance) is typically denoted by a  []. If many 
data are available one can determine best-tting travel-time curves for dierent 
seismic phases. (Note: in practice we do not know the earthquake location and 
origin time (hypocentre) and the determination of source location and spatial 
variations in wave speed are intimately connected, with some nasty trade-os). 
The variation of the travel time as a function of distance (T() [s]) can 
be used to construct models of the variation of wave speed with depth. Using 
some simple physics one can also show that the knowledge of the wavespeed as 
function of depth (in combination with constraints such as the average density 
and the moment of inertia (I 0.33 MR2 for the Earth) can be used to deduce 
the radial variation in density. The relevant equation, the Adams-Williamson 
equation, is valid in regions where density is controlled by adiabatic compression 
a n dw i l l b e d e r i v e dl a t e r . 
In general, the wave speed increases with increasing depth in the mantle due 
to the eect of increasing pressure on the bulk modulus () and rigidity (). 
(Note: P wave speed  =  +4
3/; S wave speed  = /). 
An abrupt increase in both P and S wave speed occurs at a depth of about 
10-40 km. This seismic discontinuity marks the crust-mantle interface and was 
discovered by Mohorovicic (hence Moho discontinuity). The denition (and 
thus the mapping) of the seismological Moho is primarily based on seismic wave 
speeds and does not necessarily coincide with a petrologic moho (See Anderson, 
1988, for discussion). This leads to a subdivision in terms of crust-mantle-core; 
the subdivision in terms of crust-lithosphere-asthenosphere-mantle is based on 
thermal or mechanical properties. The latter nomenclature is, unfortunately, 
not unique and dierent scientists may mean dierent things, so beware!) 
Between about 400 and 1000 km in depth the increase in wave speeds is larger 
than expected from adiabatic compression. This observation (rst by Birch,</text>

momentum. About 60% of the angular momentum of the solar system is asso-
ciated with the orbit of Jupiter alone. Most models suggest that the protosun 
was rotating more rapidly than at present. Helioseismological results show that 
deeper parts of the sun rotate faster than the surface. The deep solar interior, 
which has not yet been probed, may hold the record of that bodys relic ro-
tation. Solar system evolution models must show how the protosuns angular 
momentum gets transported outward. Most models invoke magnetic and gravi-
tational torques that spin down the sun and spin up the planets. Magnetizations 
of meteorites are consistent with this idea. The transfer of angular momentum 
could have contributed to the chemical fractionation of the solar system, since 
an outwardly migrating magnetic eld would aect the ionized plasma but not 
condensed particles, which couple to the eld only by viscous drag. Thus higher 
temperature condensates would remain in the inner part of the solar system 
and more volatile constituents would be transferred outward. In fact this is 
observed. 
1.3 The Sun 
Stellar Evolution: The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram 
A common method of characterizing stars is the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) 
diagram , which is a plot of absolute magnitude or luminosity versus eective 
(blackbody) temperature. It is traditional to plot eective temperature from 
high to low on the abscissa, and luminosity from dim to bright along the ordi-
nate. For two stars with the same eective temperature, more light will come 
from the larger star than the smaller; hence the largest stars are at the top of 
an H-R diagram. 
As each star proceeds through its life cycle it moves around on the H-R 
diagram. While we cant observe the life cycle of a single star, we can search 
through the current snapshot of our galaxy and nd stars at all stages of 
evolution. Making an ensemble H-R plot reveals that many stars fall along a 
single line called the main sequence . Stars on the main sequence are in a 
relatively steady state of hydrogen burning in their cores, as is the present sun. 
An average G-type (yellow) star like our sun is thought to have a lifetime (i.e. 
a residence time on the main sequence) of about 10 billion years. 
The T-Tauri Stage 
The conspicuous absence of gas between the planets in the solar system must be 
explained in any model of solar system formation. Before a new star reaches the 
main sequence it goes through a pre-main sequence evolution of gravitational 
collapse from a protostellar nebula. Our best information about this stage 
comes from studying a class of young stars called T Tauri stars.T T a u r i 
stars are thought to be still contracting and evolving, and typically less than 
one million years old. They are typically 0.2 to 2 solar masses in size, and they</text>

ature associated with core formation. We may calculate the change in gravi-
tational potential energy associated with the instantaneous dierentiation of a 
planet from a homogeneous state to a nal state with a core and mantle. We 
shall assume that the total mass in the system remains constant. In addition, 
we will neglect contributions from other eects such as phase changes, the latent 
heat of melting, rotational kinetic energy (due to the change in moment of in-
ertia), and strain energy. The gravitational potential energy () for a spherical 
planet in hydrostatic equilibrium in which density is simply a function of radius 
may be written 
 M Gm = dm (1.11) 
0 r 
where m =4/3r3 is the mass of accreting spherical body, and dm =4r2dr.

1.10 Chondrites 
Chondrites form the most abundant class of meteorites and as a group represent 
primordial objects that are chemically similar to the sun. They are so named be-
cause they contain chondrules3, which are primitive, glassy, silicate globules 
up to a few millimeters in size. Chondrules were magnetized as independent 
grains, and have never been found in a terrestrial rock. It is believed that the 
chondrules condensed out of the protoplanetary nebula before being incorpo -
rated into a matrix that consists of crystalline silicate minerals and sometimes 
grains or laments of iron-nickel alloy. The magnetization, spherical shape and 
ne crystalline structure indicate that they were melted and very rapidly cooled, 
perhaps on time scales as short as minutes. Chondrules have been preserved 
because they were incorporated into parent bodies that were not large enough 
to undergo dynamic processes that would modify or destroy them. 
A comparison of elemental abundance in a chondrite versus elemental abun-
dance in the suns photosphere, as determined by spectroscopy, yields an as-
tonishing correspondence. The only elements that dont match well are the 
most volatile elements, which tend to escape incorporation into a meteorite as 
it cools, and lithium, which is depleted in the sun due to nuclear reactions. 
The name chondrite has come to refer more broadly to any meteorite with a 
chemical composition that is similar to that of the sun, and there are a num-
ber of subclasses, dened on the basis of their chemistry and their degree of 
metamorphism, i.e., the modication of their structure and mineralogy due to 
temperature and pressure. 
Carbonaceous Chondrites 
An important fall occurred in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1969, when a large me-
teor was observed to come into the atmosphere many pieces. The rst piece 
was found near a house in the small village of Pueblito de Allende. Follow -
ing standard practice, all of the meteorite fragments that were recovered from 
that fall are collectively named Allende. The Allende fall occurred just as the 
Apollo program was swinging into full gear, and it gave scientists who were 
preparing for the arrival of moon rocks an opportunity to practice techniques 
for analysis of chemical composition on an extraterrestrial sample. Because of 
its unique chemical constitution and the fact that there was plenty of it to go 
around, analysis of the Allende meteorite has taught us much about the early 
solar system. 
Allende is a member of an important sub-class of chondrites referred to as 
the carbonaceous chondrites . It is a Class III carbonaceous chondrite that 
is the most primitive (i.e. least altered by heating or other metamorphism) of 
that class and much of what we know about the bulk composition of the Earth 
is based on that single meteorite.

The Earth in the Solar 
System 
1.1	Solar System Formation, Accretion, and the 
Early Thermal State of the Earth 
To understand the composition and early evolution of the Earth it is necessary 
to consider as far back as the formation of our solar system. Solar system 
formation was a complex process that is not well understood because of the 
lack of data and the vast physical and chemical complexities of the process. 
However, there are certain key parameters that we do know. As discussed in a 
later lecture, we know from the study of meteorites the age of the solar system 
and its initial composition. And, comparatively speaking, we know much about 
the nature of the present-day solar system. In addition, we have observations of 
old and young stars that inform us about the life cycle of the sun. The goal is to 
use all the information in combination with the laws of physics and chemistry 
to ll in the blanks between the initial state and the present state of the solar 
system, and to consider what this means for the constitution and initial state 
of the Earth. 
1.2	Rotation and Angular Momentum 
All the planets revolve in the same direction around the sun, and in practically 
the same plane. For the most part they also rotate in the same direction about 
their own axes, although there are notable exceptions, such as Venus. The grav-
itational collapse of molecular clouds is widely believed to lead to star formation 
and it is likely that our solar system condensed from a collapsed, rotating cloud 
of gas and dust. Rotating disks of material are ubiquitous in space, occurring 
all the way from planetary to galactic scales. A rotating disk is the signature of 
a self-gravitating system that has contracted in radius and amplied its angular

sates rst appear at temperatures of 1600  1750K and consist of silicates 
oxides and titanates of calcium and aluminum, such as Al2O3,C a T i O3,a n d 
Ca2Al2Si2O7 and refractory metals such as those in the platinum group. These 
minerals are found in white inclusions in the most primitive class of meteorites, 
the Type III carbonaceous chondrites, discussed in a later lecture. Metallic 
iron condenses out next, followed by the common silicate materials forsterite 
(an olivine) and enstatite (a pyroxene). Iron sulde (troilite; FeS) and hydrous 
minerals condense at temperatures of 700-800K. Volatile materials, most no-
tably H2Oa n d C Ocondense out at 300-400K. Planets that contain these 2 
substances were accumulated from material that condensed in this temperature 
range, which provides some clue about the early thermal structure of the solar 
nebula. 
Time scales for the condensation of gas to dust, of accumulation of dust to 
planetesimals, and of accretion of planetesimals to planets and moons are also 
not well constrained. If cooling occurred slowly in comparison to other processes 
then planets would have formed during the cooling process and could have 
accreted inhomogeneously. If instead cooling occurred rapidly, then the planets 
would have formed from cold, generally homogeneous material. Homogeneous 
accretion models are favored, with planetary dierentiation thought to be mostly 
accomplished in the early stages after accretion. 
Accretion 
The process or processes that were responsible for the accumulation of dust and 
small particles into planetesimals is a matter of debate. Sticking mechanisms 
such as electrostatic attraction and vacuum welding have been suggested. But 
as material accumulates, more planetesimal surface area is available for adding 
more material so the process accelerates. When planetesimals reach sizes of 
order 102 km gravitational attraction begins to dominate and accretion becomes 
dominated by that force. In the planetesimal accretion stage collisional velocities 
are a key consideration. If relative velocities between planetesimals are too low, 
then planetesimals will fall into nearly concentric orbits. Collisions will be low 
probability events and planets will not grow. Whereas if relative velocities 
between planetesimals are too high, fragmentation rather than accumulation 
will occur, and again planets wont grow. Safronov used scaling arguments 
concerning energy dissipation during collisions and an assumed size distribution 
of planetesimals to suggest that the mutual gravitation causes relative velocities 
to be somewhat less than the escape velocities of the largest bodies. By his 
estimation the system should regulate itself in a way to favor the growth of 
large planetesimals. If this idea holds in a general sense, then solar systems 
should form with a relatively small number of large planetary bodies rather 
than with many small bodies. Monte Carlo simulations bear this idea out.</text>

The inner core (IC) has a radius of about 1220 km the IC comprises less 
than 1%(!) of the volume of the Earth, but it represents about 1.7% of the 
Earths mass. Because of the small size of the IC, the uncertainty of its density 
is relatively large. But within the uncertainty, the IC may simply be a frozen 
version of the OC, and thus heavier since the lighter elements are selectively 
rejected, with as major constituents Fe2O, FeNiO, pure Fe or a Fe-Ni alloy. 
Some compositional layering of the core is probable. (Anderson (1988) is a 
good reference for core composition). 
Because of the recent developments in understanding the structure of the 
inner core (anisotropy, net rotation relative to the Earths mantle) and the 
importance of the core for the Earths magnetic eld, the core will be discussed 
in detail during this course (including reading assignments). (Some outstanding 
problems: what maintains the IC-OC boundary? OC-lower mantle boundary? 
What produces the energy to drive core convection that produces the magnetic 
eld? Is there convection in the solid IC?). 
1.16 Lateral heterogeneity in the mantle 
Introduction 
The outer core behaves as a liquid and its low viscosity cannot sustain lateral 
variations in density and can thus be regarded as homogeneous for many prac-
tical purposes. The mantle, however, is probably heterogeneous at all length 
scales. To a large extent this heterogeneity can be attributed to convective 
circulation in the mantle and the recycling of (oceanic) lithosphere. The most 
important dynamic processes will be discussed later. This heterogeneity causes 
observed seismic data to dier from predictions from a simple radially stratied 
reference model. Later in this course I will show how certain imaging tech-
niques can be used to interpret these travel time residuals to map the aspherical 
structure of the Earths interior. 
Plate Tectonics forms an integral aspect of this convective system and a 
relevant discussion of plate tectonics thus involves more than the essentially 
kinematic concepts that were outlined in the 1960-ies. Therefore, plate tecton -
ics, and its relationship with mantle convection, will be discussed in the second 
half of this course. However, to facilitate communication it is useful to intro-
duce some jargon and dene important concepts, processes, and their resulting 
structures. 
Plate boundaries as belts of high seismic activity 
Once travel time table are established from a redundant seismological data set 
they can be used to locate earthquakes. The pattern of seismicity is now well 
established and denes the locations of the plate boundaries. Note that the 
distribution of earthquakes within plate boundaries (or plate boundary zones) 
varies, which gives important information about the deformation in certain re-</text>

1.7 Radiometric Dating 
The Rubidium-Strontium System 
To illustrate the radiometric dating technique, consider the decay of the unstable 
isotope of rubidium, 87Rb, into the stable isotope of strontium, 87Sr. This 
system is particularly simple because the parent element only decays into one 
type of daughter element, unlike 40K, say, which decays into both 40Ar and 40Ca 
. The Rb-Sr system is useful for dating old rocks because the decay constant  
and half-life T1/2 for the Rb-Sr system are well suited for the purpose: 
1 =1.42  1011 yr ,T 1/2 =4 8.8  109 yr . (1.24) 
Only a fraction of the rubidium that was present in the solar nebula has so far 
decayed. If t is the time since some melting event reset the isotope ratios to 
their high-temperature values, then by (1.18), the current amount of 87Rb is 
reduced from its initial amount 87Rb0 by: 
87 t 87Rb = 87 Rb0 e . (1.25) 
The current amount of strontium, 87Sr, is therefore increased from its initial 
amount, 87Sr0,b y : 
87Sr =87 Sr0 +87 Rb0 87 Rb (1.26) 
=87 Sr0 +87 Rb(e87 t  1) . (1.27) 
To proceed with the dating, one uses a mass spectrometer to measure the 
amounts of 87Sr and 87Rb present in each sample. Since dierent parts of a rock 
will contain dierent concentrations of the unknown quantity 87Sr0,w e m u s t 
normalize against another stable isotope with similar chemistry that occurs in 
proportional concentrations, like 86Sr. Dividing (1.9) by 86Sr yields: 
87Sr 87Sr 87Rb = + (e 87 t  1) . (1.28) 86Sr 86Sr 86Sr0 
The presence of initial daughter abundances also requires more than one 
measurement of the parent/daughter ratio to obtain an age. Samples that have 
dierent 87Rb/86Sr ratios can be plotted versus 87Sr/86Sr using (1.10). The 
87Rb/86Sr ratio varies naturally from one mineral to another. For example it is 
typically higher in plagioclase than in pyroxene, so a spread in the samples is 
obtained by mineral separation. When plotted, the two ratios fall on a straight 
line called an isochron (meaning equal time), which by 1.28 has a slope of 
(et  1)  t and a y-intercept of (87Sr/86Sr)0. If the decay constant  of the 
radioactive parent is known, the isochron yields the age, t,o f t h e r o c k . 
The most useful decay systems for radiometric dating are Rubidium-Strontium 
(Rb-Sr), Samarium-Neodymium (Sm-Nd), Potassium-Argon (K-Ar), Thorium-
Lead (Th-Pb), and the two Uran-ium-Lead (U-Pb) systems. As illustrated</text>

          <text>8 CHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
1.5 Early Thermal State of the Earth 
Accretional Heating 
As planetesimals accrete into moons and planets a signicant amount of energy 
must be released, much of which will be converted to heat. Various theories 
place the time for the accretion of Earth from 105-108 years, which was very 
rapid indeed in comparison to the age of the solar system. If accretion occurred 
rapidly, then not much cooling could have occurred between collisions. 
To determine the amount of heating associated with accretion, it is necessary 
to take an inventory of the various sources of energy in the system. These include 
the kinetic energy of impacting projectiles, the potential energy of infalling 
material to the planetary surface and the thermal energy. For simplicity we 
will begin by assuming that accretion occurs suciently rapidly such that the 
process is adiabatic, i.e. with no heat lost from the accreting planets surface. 
The total energy per unit mass of accreted material is simply a sum of the 
change in kinetic and potential contributions2: 
1  2 GM2 
CpT = v  vp + (1.7) 2 R 
where T is the temperature change, Cp is specic heat, v is the absolute 
velocity of the approaching projectile, vp is the planetary velocity, (v)2 = 
2 2v  vp is the relative impact velocity, G is the universal constant of gravitation, 
M is the mass of the planet, R is the planetary radius and 
GM = gR, (1.8) R 
where g is the gravitational acceleration at the planetary surface. It is reasonable 
to assume that the impact process is not perfectly ecient and that only a 
fraction h of the total energy will be converted to heat. Taking this into account 
and substituting ( .5) we may write 
1  2 2 
CpT = h v  vp + gR . (1.9) 2 
This expression provides an upper limit of the increase in temperature that 
could occur during accretion. In practice the potential energy term dominates 
(1.9). But this expression isnt very realistic because it doesnt allow for cooling. 
So we next consider the additional complication that heat is lost from the 
system by cooling at the surface. It is possible to write a balance between the 
gravitational potential energy of accretion, the heat lost by radiation, and the 
thermal energy associated with heating of the body. This causes the problem 
to become time dependent: 
GM (r) dr = /epsilon1  
T 4(r)  Tb 4 
dt + Cp [T (r)  Tb] dt (1.10) r 
2 Notice that this treatment does not follow the conventional denition of gravitational 
potential as used in later chapters, U =  GM . r</text>

concentrate in the liquid phase; the majority of them are incorporated into the 
rst few percent of a melt. For this reason, a signicant fraction of the Earths 
radioactivity is concentrated in the continental crust. 
Short-Lived Nuclides 
The short-lived radionuclides may have been an important source of heat 
responsible for the early melting of meteorites. They might also have provided 
an early heat source for planets, depending on the time between nucleosynthesis 
and planetary accretion. The most abundant of the short-lived radionuclides 
is 26Al, which decays with a half-life of 720,000 years to 26Mg. The evidence 
for 26Al being an important source of heat in the early history of the solar 
system comes from excess amounts of 24Mg found in CAIs in the Allende me-
teorite. The isotope 26Mg was enriched relative to the most common isotope 
24Mg compared to solar abundance. The heat-producing ability of this isotope 
is such that solid objects a few km or greater would have been heated to melt-
ing if they formed with the ratio of 26Al/27Al implied to have been present in 
Allende. 
A major question is: how could 26Al be incorporated fast enough into early 
solar system objects to melt them? With such a short half-life, radioactive decay 
begins to produce heat after a cosmically short period of time. The isotope 26Mg 
is only produced by decay of 26Al, and 26Al is only produced in supernovae . 
This suggests that our solar system might have formed close to a supernova. 
Another piece of information in support of the supernova hypothesis is the fact 
that very small diamonds have been found in some meteorites. On Earth dia-
mond forms at great depths due to very high pressures which contract carbon to 
the closely-packed state, characterized by all covalent bonds. In space the pres-
sures required to form diamond can only be achieved in a supernova. If the solar 
system formed near a supernova it would solve the problem of the mechanism 
that caused the protosolar cloud to collapse, as the shock waves that emanate 
from supernovae would provide a natural mechanism for compression. However, 
supernovae are rare events and if it is necessary to invoke the participation of 
one it would imply that the formation of our solar system was a chance event. 
1.9	Meteorites and the Bulk Composition of the 
Earth 
The chemical and mineralogical information contained in the various types of 
meteorites yield some of our most important clues about the nature of the 
early solar system and the early Earth. A wide range of information about 
the chemical and physical state derives from analysis of the various classes of 
meteorites. We review the various types of meteorites and their implications for 
the Earths bulk composition.</text>

          <text>16 CHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
The age information is contained in the slope, M , using only isotopes of Pb. 
The value of 235U/238Ui s 1/137.88, and this ratio is very nearly constant in 
all natural materials. To determine the initial lead ratios the standard practice 
is to look to meteorites. Iron meteorites have virtually no uranium. The least 
radiogenic lead found anywhere is in the Canyon Diablo meteorite. This is 
dened to be primordial lead, the initial lead ratio in the solar nebula. 
The Age of Earth 
Using the decay constants for uranium, the 235U/238U ratio given above, and 
the initial lead ratios from Canyon Diablo this gives a date of (4.54  0.03)  109 
years. This is the time when isotopically homogeneous lead was isolated from 
the solar nebula in various bodies with dierent U/Pb ratios. This is the best 
estimate the age of the Earth. It is interesting that Earth and the meteorites 
fall on the same lead-lead isochron, which is evidence that lead and uranium 
were both isotopically homogeneous in the solar nebula before the accretion into 
the planets. 
The radiometric dating of crustal and oceanic rocks from Earths surface 
indicates that most of the surface is less than 100 million years old. The oldest 
rock was dated by Sam Bowring of MIT. It is an igneous rock and the age is 
4.03  109 years. The surface of Earth is much younger than that of the other 
solid planets for several reasons. 
Erosion is ecient on Earth because of the abundance of liquid water and 
because of the presence of a biosphere. Earth also renews its surface continu -
ously through the action of plate tectonics, where new crustal material comes 
to the surface at mid-ocean ridges and old crustal material plunges below the 
surface at subduction zones. Given the great activity occurring on Earths sur-
face, it is not at all surprising that terrestrial rocks are not the oldest rocks in 
the solar system. 
1.8 Radioactivity as a Heat Source 
Radioactivity is an important source of heating in the early solar system and 
in addition represents the major source of long-term heating of the Earth (and 
other terrestrial planets). The important heat-producing radionuclides form two 
classes: long-lived nuclides and short-lived nuclides. 
Long-Lived Nuclides 
The long-lived radionuclides , of which the most important are 238U, 235U, 
232Th and 40K, are a primary source of heat over the span of Earth history. They 
provide heat which drives present-day mantle convection. Long-lived radioactive 
elements have combinations of valence states and ionic radius that prevent them 
from being easily accommodated into the crystal lattices of the most common 
silicate rocks. They are examples of lithophile elements, which preferentially</text>

1952) has major implications for mantle dynamics and will be discussed in more 
detail later. The increase in now generally believed to be due to isochemical 
phase changes in the mantle silicates. 
In the outer core, the P-wave speed decreases abruptly and this, in fact, 
causes the shadow zone for P- waves that was used as one of the major argu-
ments by Oldham (1906) and Gutenberg (1912) to infer from seismological data 
the existence of a core and the depth to the core-mantle-boundary (CMB). The 
core behaves as a uid (pointed out by Jereys in 1926 on the basis of tidal data, 
i.e. later than the discovery of the CMB!) even on short time scales so that shear 
waves cannot propagate through the (outer) core. The inner core (discovered 
by Inge Lehman (Denmark) in 1936) is solid; the seismological evidence for this 
will be discussed later. (Question: temperature increases monotonically with 
increasing depth, so why is there an alternation between depth intervals where 
rock is solid and where it behaves as a liquid?) 
Composition 
Despite centuries of geologic prospecting we have limited access to most parts of 
the Earth. consequently our understanding of its bulk composition must come 
from inference based on remote observation as well as the record from meteorites 
and the solar atmosphere. The dominant non-volatile constitutents in the sun 
are silicon [Si], magnesium [Mg] and iron [Fe]. The meteorites similarly are 
dominated by these elements and their oxides. 
Some of the internal boundaries of the Earth represent phase changes that 
separate regions of the same bulk composition, others coincide with a change 
in chemistry. Seismology helps but can often not uniquely determine variations 
in temperature, composition, or density. There are often several mineral as-
semblages that have the same density or elastic properties. Using the cosmic 
abundance of elements and results of laboratory experiments at high pressures 
and temperatures with rock forming minerals and their analogs we have, how-
ever, arrived at the following broad picture of the average composition in each 
of the concentric shells: 
(Recall that the most abundant non-volatile elements in the solar system are 
magnesium [Mg], iron [Fe], and silicon [Si].) 
The crust , which is only 0.5% of the volume of the mantle, is rich in SiO2 
and Al2O3 (hence the old name SiAl) + CaO, Na2O. 
The composition of the mantle is roughly given by the following series of 
solid solutions, with primary constituents SiO2 and MgO (hence the old name 
SiMa; also MaFic, i.e. magnesium and iron (Fe) rich): 
Important are the following two pairs: 
(Mg , Fe1)O + SiO 2  (Mg , Fe1)SiO 3 (orthopyroxene) 
2(Mg , Fe1)O + SiO 2  (Mg , Fe1)2SiO 4 (olivine) 
with  =M g /(Mg + Fe) approximately 0.9 (names used for olivine:  = 
1: forsterite;  = 0: fayalite). The magnesium number is dened as 100</text>

The other piece of evidence for iron planetary cores comes from the process 
of nucleosynthesis . Iron has the highest binding energy for nucleon and is thus 
highly stable and produced in abundance in stellar evolution. The equilibrium 
process (aka e-process ) in stellar thermonuclear reactions breaks apart silicon 
atoms and re-arranges them to convert silicon to heavier and more stable nuclei. 
The most stable and thus most abundant element produced in the e-process is 
iron. 
1.14 The Terrestrial Planets 
The table below shows a comparison of the mean densities and moment of 
inertia factors (C/MR2) for the terrestrial planets. The mean densities are 
uncompressed so they correct for self-compression and represent zero-pressure 
densities. The moment of inertia, which will be derived later in the semester, is 
a measure of the the extent to which mass is concentrated toward the center of a 
body with a value of 0.4 representing a uniform, homogeneous sphere and lesser 
values representing mass increasingly concentrated toward the center. This 
parameter reects both self-compression and the presence of increasingly dense 
material toward the center. 
Note that Venus and Earth are quite similar, consistent with their similarity 
in radius and mass. Mars has a lower bulk density and a higher moment of 
inertia core indicating less iron and a smaller core. Mercury is denser and while 
the moment of inertia hasnt been measured, it is thought based on the mass 
that its core is nearly 80% of the planets radius. Mercury thus likely has a 
large iron core. The Moon has a bulk density similar to that of Earths mantle 
and a moment of inertia just slightly less than that of a uniform sphere. The 
implied upper limit of core size is 350 km (out of a radius of 1738 km). Thus 
the Moon has very little iron in the interior.

strained by astronomical and meteorite data represents the stable structure that</text>

1.11 Secondary Processing 
If we want to use chondrites and other meteorites as a probe of the early so-
lar system, we need to have a good idea of the types of processes that mod-
ied these meteorites from their original forms. Igneous meteorites, like the 
howardite-eucrite-diogenite suite (HED) , have denitely experienced sec-
ondary processing. However, they do provide unique information about the 
evolution of Earth and terrestrial planets, particularly basalt generation and 
core formation. Chondrites may be the least altered class of meteorites, but 
they too have undergone secondary processing. Most chondrites have experi -
enced thermal metamorphism. The result is changes in texture and mineral -
ogy, and possibly chemical composition. The temperatures necessary to cause 
metamorphism are in the 400 to 1000C range for the relatively low pressures 
encountered in small parent bodies. Possibly important heat sources are the 
decay of short-lived radionuclides, electromagnetic induction, and accretion of 
material. The least metamorphosed type III chondrites (like Allende) probably 
carry the most information about the early solar system, but even these have 
been eected somewhat by secondary thermal processing. Along with heat, the 
chemical reactivity of water has played an important role in the secondary pro-
cessing of some of the most compositiona lly primitive meteorites. This process, 
called aqueous alteration, tends to replace the preaccretionary lithology with 
new mineralizations, although the bulk chemistry is apparently preserved. 
Along with internal processing, meteorites can be changed by exogenic pro-
cesses like collisions. Violent impacts produce shock metamorphism of individ -
ual mineral grains, and also produce rocks called breccias that contain mixtures 
of dierent previous rocks, just like the breccias found on the lunar highlands. 
The study of breccias has provided information on the accretional growth and 
processing of parent bodies. The eects of shock metamorphism have been seen 
in all major groups of meteorites. It appears that collision-induced high speed 
impacts took place before, during, and after the initial accretion and dierenti -
ation of the parent bodies. 
Meteorites contain information related to their long exposures to galactic 
cosmic rays, solar radiation and the solar wind. It is possible to determine 
how long a meteorite existed free of its parent body before it impacted Earth by 
examining the cosmic ray damage. Noble gases are the most volatile elements in 
meteorites, but they are nonetheless present in measurable quantities in virtually 
all meteorites. Trapped noble gases are either solar or planetary. The 
solar noble gases are actually implanted solar-wind or solar-are material, and 
provide relatively direct information about the sun. The planetary noble gases 
have elemental abundances similar to those found in Earths atmosphere. 
1.12 Achondrites 
The achondrites are igneous meteorites that lack water-bearing (hydrous) or 
oxidized minerals. This class of meteorites includes the eucrites , diogenites</text>

gions. On the basis of seismic belts about 12 major plates have been recognized. 
Important aspects of kinematic plate-tectonic theory are that (1) the deforma -
tion within the plates (intraplate ) is neglected; all deformation is assumed to 
take place between plates (interplate ) (if need be plates are subdivided into 
smaller units until this condition is met). In other words, plates act as stress 
guides, which is important for the understanding of the driving forces of plate 
tectonics; (2) once new oceanic lithosphere is created it forms part of a rigid 
plate; the plate may or may not contain continents; (3) in order to conserve the 
total area of the Earths surface: the rate of lithosphere creation equals rate 
of lithosphere destruction. The seismograms also contain information about 
the physical rupture mechanism of earthquakes and can thus be used in the 
classication of dierent types of plate boundary. 
divergent plate boundaries Associated with normal faults (plates move 
away from each other). Characteristic in Mid Ocean Ridge (MOR) sys-
tems; locations of sea oor spreading where new oceanic crust is being 
created rather passively by means of decompression melting. Such bound -
aries are sometimes referred to as accreting margins but this is confusing 
since an important mechanism of continental growth is by means of ac-
cretion of allochthonous terranes (accretionary wedges, accreted terranes) 
onto Precambrian shields, for instance the western cordillera in Canada 
and eastern Australia. 
convergent plate boundaries Associated with reverse faults (plates move 
towards each other). Sometimes referred to as destructive margins. Char-
acteristic in circum-Pacic belt. Often accompanied with mountain build-
ing, subduction, deep seismicity, and arc volcanism. Diagnostic bathymet -
ric feature: deep sea trenches. 
transcurrent plate boundaries Associated with strike slip faults. Impor -
tant in particular in association with ocean oor spreading  transform 
faults. There is a separate classication of transform faults based on 
whether they connect ridges or trenches, but thats not so exciting. Most 
common are ridge-ridge transforms. These are locations of many earth-
quakes since slip rate is twice as fast as spreading rate! 
Lithosphere, asthenosphere, subduction zones 
We will use the term lithosphere4 for the mechanically strong outer shell of 
the earth, which contains the crust and part of the mantle. It is a thermal 
boundary layer (TBL) through which heat is lost to the surface by conduction. 
There is also a thermal denition, in which the base of the lithosphere coincides 
with the 1300C isotherm (up to 100 km deep for oceans; at least twice that 
much for some (parts of) continents), but the mechanically strong (elastic) part 
of the lithosphere that can transmit stresses and support surface loads (e.g.,

exponential of both sides we may write 
N(t)= No e t , (1.18) 
where No is the initial number of radioactive particles. Equation 1.18 is the rate 
law of radioactive decay. The half-life , T1/2, which represents the time it takes 
for half of the number of particles to decay, is found by setting N/N o =1/2 
such that 
N 1 ln 2 0.69315 = = e T1/2  T1/2 = = . (1.19) No 2   
Note that the half-life represents an alternative way of expressing the decay 
constant . Nuclear binding energies are very large and nuclei are so small that 
radioactive decay rates are not signicantly aected by physical conditions on 
Earth such as pressure and temperature. However, half-lives can be changed 
slightly by changes in bonding energy. For example, solar wind studies have 
shown that radioactive beryllium decays at slightly dierent rates on the sun 
and Earth. 
In principle, the experimentally-demonstrated accuracy of the simple expres -
sion (1.19) allows for the determination of the absolute ages of billion-year-old 
rocks. However, in practice the initial concentration of the radioactive parent 
element No is very often not known. We can more easily measure the concen -
tration of the daughter product (D), which is simply

where M(r) is the mass of the accumulating planet,  is the density of accreting 
material, /epsilon1 is emissivity,  is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, Tb is the radiation 
equilibrium (blackbody) temperature, and t is time. In reality there will also be 
energy associated with latent heats of melting and vaporization that are ignored 
here. Temperature increases associated with the accretion of the the terrestrial 
planets from numerical solutions to (1.10) require rapid accretion times, 103 
to 104 years for Earth, to exceed the melting temperature. These time scales 
are less than suggested by accretion models and would suggest that accretional 
heating is not very important for Earth or the other terrestrial planets. But 
it is necessary to consider in the most realistic sense possible the importance 
of radiation in ridding the planet of heat. Radiative temperature loss goes 
as T 4 and so is highly ecient in the sense that the planetary surface cools 
quickly. But if an impact site becomes buried by ejecta from fall-back or from 
nearby impacts, the surface would be covered. In this situation the outer part 
of the planet is hotter than the interior and thermal convection is prohibited. 
The only way to rid the planet of heat is to conduct it to the surface where 
it can be radiated away. Conduction is a much less ecient heat transport 
process and so accretional heat would be retained longer if that mechanism 
dominated. If accretional energy is buried deeply enough to prohibit thermal 
radiation from the surface, then temperature increases of order 2000 can be 
attained for planets that accrete in times suggested by models (106-107 years). 
But even if accretion did cause the near surface of the Earth to melt the process 
does not explain the earliest heating of the Earths deep interior, which occurred 
through the process of dierentiation. 
Dierentiation 
From the Earths moment of inertia (C/MR2), which will be discussed later, 
we know that the Earth (and other terrestrial planets) have a radially stratied 
internal density structure. The implied increases in density with depth are 
greater than would be associated with simple self-compression due to an increase 
of pressure with depth. This leaves compositional changes, and to a lesser extent 
phase changes, to explain the observations. If the Earth accreted cold, then 
there must have been a process of internal dierentiation to produce its radially 
stratied density structure. Dierentiation from a homogeneous initial state to 
a structure with a distinct core and mantle involves a change in gravitational 
potential energy. The release of this energy was likely to have been an important 
source of heat in some planetary bodies. It is believed that dierentiation would 
have occurred early in planetary evolution after a period of radioactive heating 
or in the last stages of impact accretion in which the temperature required 
to melt iron is achieved at shallow depth. Molten iron separates out from its 
silicate matrix and is denser than its surroundings and sinks by gravitational 
settling. It is reasonable to assume that the separation and sinking time is short 
compared to the time of heating. Also, the process is taking place in the interior 
so to rst order surface heat loss may be neglected. 
Under these assumptions it is possibl e to estimate the increase in temper -</text>

would have been largely molten and vigorously convecting in the interior as a 
consequence of dierentiation. For Venus the size of the core isnt known but if 
it is similar to Earth (given that planets similar radius and mass), then Venus 
also would have experienced signicant early melting when it formed its core. 
Melting also probably occurred on Mercury. But for Mars and the Moon the 
temperature increase is not great enough for melt generation, even taking into 
account the considerable uncertainties in core radii. Core formation could not 
have been a signicant heat source early in the evolution of these bodies. 
Formation of the Moon 
We discussed above the role of impacts in the Earths early heat budget from 
the illustrative calculation of temperature increase due to accretional heating. 
But after accretion there will continue to be impact infall as the planets sweep 
up asteroidal debris. This is quite apparent from looking at the 4.6 BY-old 
lunar highlands, which are saturated with impact craters formed during the 
terminal bombardment . It is now thought that a massive post-accretional 
impact was responsible for the formation of the Moon. The origin of the Moon 
has been a long-debated topic. While moons around planets are common in the 
solar system, Earths moon is somewhat unusual given its large size compared 
to the primary. One might wonder then, whether special circumstances were 
associated with lunar origin. 
Traditional models for lunar formation included co-accretion (the Moon 
formed near the Earth), capture (the Moon strayed too near to Earth and 
b e c a m e t r a p p e di no r b i t ) , a n d s s i o n ( t h eM o o nf o r m e db ys p i n n i n g o  t h e 
Earth during an early rapid rotational period). All of these models had serious 
problems in explaining important features like the Moons bulk composition, 
the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, etc. 
The theory that is currently is favored is the giant impact hypothesis , 
which has gained support from numerical simulations and is consistent with the 
features above. In this scenario, shortly after accretion the Earth received a 
glancing impact from a Mars-sized asteroidal body. Smoothed particle hydro -
dynamic simulations from independent groups at Harvard and the University of 
Arizona have the same general features: The mantles of both the early Earth 
and the impactor melted and vaporized and the core of the impacting body 
wrapped around Earths core. Mantle material from Earth and the projectile 
that was ejected re-condensed in orbit to form the Moon. This hypothesis is 
able to explain the puzzling lack of iron in the Moon. If this event did indeed 
occur then the Earth would have been largely melted by the event. Such a catas-
trophic occurrence must factor in to scenarios for the post-accretional evolution 
of the Earth.</text>

above, in order for a parent-daughter system to be useful, a non-radiogenic ref-
erence isotope of the daughter must be present for comparison. In addition, 
the decay constant of the parent must be accurately known. The accuracy of 
radiometric dating also depends on the extent to which the rock under study 
has been a chemically closed system with respect to the parent and daughter 
elements. If it has not been a closed system then the daughter/parent ratio 
will not be solely due to radioactive decay, and the time information will be 
corrupted. 
The Uranium-Lead System 
The U-Pb system is especially useful because only measurements of Pb are 
required, and Pb tends to be reliable because it is not too mobile in rock. Also, 
because of decades of nuclear research the decay constants for uranium are very 
accurately known. Zircon crystals are resistant to uranium diusion and are 
commonly used for this dating scheme. There are four isotopes of Pb: 204Pb, 
208Pb206Pb, 207Pb, .O n l y 204Pbdoes not have a radioactive progenitor, and 
the decay schemes for the other three isotopes are: 
238U  206 Pb , 238 =1.55  1010 yr1 ,T 1/2 =4.5 By (1.29) 
235U  207 Pb , 235 =9.85  1010 yr1 ,T 1/2 =0.7 By (1.30) 
232Th  208 Pb , 232 =4.95  1011 yr1 ,T 1/2 =1 4 B y . (1.31)

results from dierentiation processes as discussed by Maria Zuber. In addition 
to using this structure for the introduction of some useful terminology this radial 
structure serves as an important reference model for many geophysical inves-
tigations. The average properties are now fairly well known; it is fair to say 
that the uncertainties in the average values are insignicant as compared to 
the local and regional deviations from the reference value. Constraining and 
understanding the aspherical variations in physical properties is the objective 
of many geophysical studies. It involves the study of anomalies relative to a 
reference values (e.g., gravity and heat ow anomalies). The deviations from 
the reference values contain information pertinent to geodynamical processes. 
Radial stratication of the Earth from seismic data 
The essential data used to derive the depth variation of seismic wave speed in 
these early days of seismology were the travel times of dierent types of seismic 
waves. These can be determined from seismograms, which are records (analog 
or digital) of ground motion due to earthquakes or man-made explosions (e.g., 
nuclear tests). 
Some history: Until late last century most research relevant to seismology 
was in fact done by physicists and mathematicians who loved to study elas-
tic wave propagation (famous names that also contributed to seismology are 
Navier , Poisson , Gauss , Rayleigh ). Therefore, most of the theory was al-
ready available at around the time of birth of observational seismology (late 
last century; installation of the rst seismometers for systematic earthquake 
monitoring). 
Following a rapid succession of discoveries in the early years of this century, 
the major subdivision of the Earth in concentric shells was established about 60 
years ago, in the mid- to late thirties, by the pioneering work of Jereys and 
Bullen and by Gutenberg and Richter . The following dates give some idea 
about the pace of developments: 
	1892- First record of earthquake (Japan) 
	1906- Oldham demonstrates existence of core from seismic data 
	1909- Mohorovicic discovers seismic interface that marks the crust-mantle 
boundary (MOHO) 
	1912- Gutenberg estimates depth to core mantle boundary 
	1936- Lehman discovers existence of Inner Core 
	1939- early knowledge summarized in rst 1D Earth models, the famous 
Jereys-Bullen tables (which are still surprisingly accurate) 
	1948- Bullen uses wave speed information + estimates of Earths moment 
of inertia to determine average density as a function of increasing depth.</text>

sea mounts) on geologic time scales is about half the TBL thickness (coinciding 
with the 650C isotherm). The cooling of oceanic lithosphere (+ relationship 
between lithospheric thickness and heat ow with square root of its age since 
formation at the MOR) is one of the classical aspects of plate tectonics that 
will be discussed in the course of this term. In contrast, deformation in the 
asthenosphere5 occurs more freely by means ductile creep on geologic time 
scales. The asthenosphere may lubricate but does not participate directly in 
tectonic motion, although it could accommodate some of the return ow. Heat 
loss in asthenosphere and deeper mantle is controlled by convection. 
As oceanic lithosphere moves away from the MOR it will cool and thicken 
and become more dense due to thermal contraction. Eventually, it will become 
gravitationally unstable and can, in principle, sink into the Earths interior at 
ocean trenches (note: initiation of subduction is not trivial since even gravita -
tionally unstable parts of the lithosphere can be retained at the surface by the 
strength of the lithosphere). We will use the term subduction zone rather 
loosely for the geographical region where plate convergence results in the de-
scent of one plate beneath the other, typically the more mafic (Mg+Fer i c h ) 
oceanic beneath the more acid, granitic continental plate. The result of this 
process is a slab of subducted former oceanic lithosphere that sinks into 
the mantle. The negative buoyancy of the downgoing slab is, in fact, one of the 
most important forces of plate motion. The depth extent of slabs is still debated, 
but that does not  according to these denitions  inuence the meaning of 
a subduction zone. In the upper mantle and transition zone the slabs can be 
delineated by earthquakes (the so called Wadati-Benio zones), the slab is said 
to be seismogenic down to about 670 km depth (the actual depth to the deepest 
earthquakes can be smaller depending on the thermal structure of the slab). 
There is now convincing evidence to support the aseismic continuation of slabs 
into the lower mantle.

Mg/(Mg + Fe) and is often used in discussions of mantle rheology (a typical 
value is 90). Another important upper mantle mineral is garnet, also a (Mg,Fe) 
silicate. With increasing pressure in the mantle olivine transforms to spinel 
(same composition) and post-spinel. Pyroxene + garnet transform to perovskite 
in the lower mantle. 
There is some debate whether the relative amount of iron increases in the 
lower mantle (perhaps with a small, 2%, increase in intrinsic density (i.e. in 
addition to the eect of adiabatic compression): such a small density contrast 
may not be signicant from a dynamic point of view) and there is a growing con-
sensus that the composition of the lower mantle is similar to that of the upper 
mantle and transition zone. However, due to the higher pressures the crystallo -
graphic structure is dierent, more compact. The most important constituents 
in the lower mantle are: 
(Mg, Fe)O (Magnesio)w ustite
(Mg, Fe)SiO 3 (Perovskite)
There is also some debate about the exact ratio of pyroxene to olivine. The 
solar abundance would favor a Mg/Si ratio close to 1, which would predict a 
predominance of pyroxene, but the presence of Fe allows for more olivine and 
the ratio that matters is the (Mg+Fe)/Si ratio. The thermodynamics of the 
phase transformations in the two silicate systems (olivine and pyroxene) are 
very important for our understanding of mantle dynamics, in particular for the 
question as to whether material can ow across the transition zone into the 
lower mantle. Because of their importance for mantel dynamics, phase changes 
will be discussed in more detail later in this course. 
The major outstanding problems pertinent to the mantle include the scale 
of mantle convection, the eectiveness of mixing, and the survival of separate 
reservoirs of compositional heterogeneity as inferred from isotope data. We will 
come back to these exciting topics towards the end of the course. 
The core (32% of the mass of the Earth; how much of its volume?) largely 
consist of iron. Fe is the only heavy element with large enough solar abundance 
to be a suitable candidate to form the heavy element required to explain the 
large density of the Earths core. However, if the core would consist entirely 
of metallic iron, its density would be higher than required from the moment of 
inertia and the mean density of the Earth. There must, therefore, be a light 
alloying element. Several of the light elements that are abundant in the solar 
system are either too volatile or are insoluble with metallic iron. The most 
likely candidate is oxygen (O) (which is insoluble with metallic iron at low 
pressures and is thus not found in iron meteorites), although some would argue 
for Sulfur (S) (which is found in iron meteorites), or Silicon (Si). (Stacey uses 
80% O + 20% S, but S does not seem to be required). This is still an area of 
active research; because of the extreme physical conditions there are hardly any 
experimental data  lot of theoretical (thermodynamics) studies of Equations 
Of State (EOS) (See Anderson, 1988, for an introduction).</text>

velocity in order to preserve its total angular momentum. In a rotating proto-
star the gravitational attraction everywhere will be towards the center of mass. 
But the centrifugal force will be directed normal to the axis of rotation. The 
resolved force vector will move gas and dust nearer to the median plane as the 
cloud contracts. This process leads to the disk shape, which dissipates energy 
and minimizes collisions. 
One of the more interesting boundary conditions is the present distribution 
of angular momentum. Consider a planet of mass m that orbits a central body 
of mass M , whose position with respect to the central body can be described 
by a vector r. 
The orbital angular momentum (L) of the planet can be written 
2L = mr 2 = mr d, (1.1) dt 
where r is distance, m is the mass,  is the angular velocity (=d/dt), and  is 
the angle with respect to a xed direction in the orbit plane. It can be shown 
that 
d L dS2 r = =2 , (1.2) dt m dt 
where S is the area swept out by r.T h e n 
dS L = , (1.3) dt 2m 
which is a statement of Keplers second Law of Motion : the line between 
a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time. Equation 
(1.3) is a statement of conservation of angular momentum . The total plan-
etary energy (E), which is the sum of the kinetic and potential contributions1 , 
mGM E =1 mv 2 + = constant (1.4) 2 r 
where 
2  2dr d2 v = + r (1.5) dt dt 
is the planetary velocity, is also conserved. It is possible to rewrite (1.1) in 
terms of the mass of the sun and doing so yields 
1/2L = mr 2 =(GM s)1/2 mr . (1.6) 
By integrating (1.6) over all the planets we nd that while the sun contains 
99.8% of the mass of the solar system, it has only about 1% of the angular

the skin depth, the depth at which the amplitude of the eld has de-
creased to 1/e of the original value. The skin depth is large for low fre-
quency signals and/or low conductivity of the half-space. Rapidly uc-
tuating elds do not penetrate into the material. (I gave the example 
of swimming in still pond: on a winter day you would - probably - not 
consider to go swimming even on a nice day with a day time temp of, say, 
20C, whereas you might on a summer day with the same temperature. 
The point is that the short period uctuations controled by night-day cy-
cles do not penetrate deep into the water; the temperature of the water 
that makes you decide whether or not to go for a swim depend more on 
the long period variations due to the changing seasons.) The rapid uc-
tuations of the external eld are used to study  in the upper mantle (z 
&lt; 1000 km) and the core eld is used to study  in the lower mantle. 
Geodynamo 
So we have a large volume of highly conducting liquid (metallic iron) that moves 
rapidly in the Earths outer core. The basic idea behind the geodynamo is that 
the rapid motion of part of the liquid in an ambient magnetic eld generates a 
current that induces a secondary magnetic eld which is largely carried along in 
the uid low (frozen ux) and which reinforces the original eld. In principle, 
this concept can be illustrated by Faradays disk generator . 
Excess of the light constituent in the outer core is released at the inner 
core boundary by progressive freezing out of the inner core. The resulting 
buoyancy drives compositional convection in the outer core, and the combination 
of convection and rotation produces the complex motion needed for self-excited 
dynamo action. The rotation eectively stretches the poloidal eld into toroidal 
eld lines (the -eect). Most geodynamo models require a strong toroidal eld, 
about 0.01 T (or 100 Gauss), even though this eld cannot be observed at the 
Earths surface. These toroidal eld lines are warped up or down due to the 
radial convective ow (assuming frozen ux): as a result of the Coriolis force 
this results in helical motion, which, in fact, recreates a poloidal component from 
a toroidal one (this is know as the -eect). The rotation controls the motion in 
such a way that the dipole eld is stronger than any other poloidal component 
and, averaged over a sucient time, coincides with the Earths rotation axis.</text>

3.1 The main eld 
From the measurement of the magnetic eld it became clear that the eld has 
both internal and external sources, both of which exhibit a time dependence. 
Spherical harmonics is a very convenient tool to account for both components. 
Lets consider the general expression of the magnetic potential as the superpo -
sition of Legendre polynomials:

l=1 m=0 a [gl cos m + h/primem sin m]l 
or, assuming Einsteins summation convention (implicit summation over 
repeated indices), we can write: 
/parenleftBig r /parenrightBigl 
Vm(r, , )= a Im + Em P m(cos ) (3.2) /parenleftBig a /parenrightBigl+1 
l l l r a 
where Im and Em are the amplitude factors of the contributions of the internal l l 
and external sources, respectively. (Note that, in contrast to the gravitational 
potential, the rst degree is l =1 , s i n c e l = 0 would represent a monopole, 
which is not relevant to geomagnetism.) 
3.2 The internal eld 
The internal eld has two components: [1] the crustal eld and [2] the core eld. 
The crustal eld 
The spatial attenuation of the eld as 1 over distance cubed means that the 
short wavelength variations at the Earths surface must have a shallow source. 
Can not be much deeper than mid crust, since otherwise temperatures are too 
high. More is known about the crustal eld than about the core eld since we 
know more about the composition and physical parameters such as temperature 
and pressure and about the types of magnetization. Two important types of 
magnetization: 
	Remanent magnetization (there is a eld B even in absence of an am-
bient eld). If this persists over time scales of O(108)y e a r s , w ec a l lt h i s 
permanent magnetization . Rocks can acquire permanent magnetiza -
tion when they cool beneath the Curie temperature (about 500-600 for 
most relevant minerals). The ambient eld then gets frozen in, which is 
very useful for paleomagnetism. 
	Induced magnetization (no eld, unless induced by ambient eld).</text>

precise, the core eld dominates the spectrum up to degree l = 14-15. At higher 
degrees the core eld is obscured by a at white-ish spectrum where the power 
no longer seems to depend on the degree, or, alternatively, the wavelength of 
the causative anomalies. This part of the spectrum must be due to sources close 
to the observation points; it relates to the crustal eld. We will see that this 
eld is important even, or, in particular, when one wants to study the magnetic 
eld at the surface of the outer core, the core mantle boundary (CMB). 
3.7 Downward continuation 
In order to study core dynamics or the geodynamo one wants to know what the 
magnetic eld is close to its source, i.e., at the CMB. 
From Eq. 3.20, we deduce that 
/parenleftBig/parenrightBigl+1a Vl(r)= Vl(a) (3.37) r /parenleftBig a /parenrightBigl+2 
B = Vl(r)= Bl(a)(l +1 ) (3.38) r

Il(r)= Il(a) (3.40) r 
with Il(a)t h e p o w e r a tE a r t h  s s u r f a c e (r = a). 
Lets look at some numbers to illustrate the eect of downward continuation 
(see Table 3.2). Consider the (r.m.s.) eld strength at the equator at both the 
Earths surface (r = a)a n d a t t h e C M B (r =0.54a (so that a/r =1.82) (Use 
eq. (3.36)).

In other words, if the spectrum of the core eld is red at the Earths sur-
face, it is more pink-ish at the CMB because the higher degree components are 
preferentially amplied upon downward continuation. However, the amplitude 
of the higher degree components (the value of the related Gauss coecients) 
is small and, consequently, the relative uncertainty in these coecients large. 
Upon downward continuation these uncertainties are  of course  also ampli-
ed, so that at the CMB the higher degree components are large but uncertain 
and the observational constraints for them are increasingly weak! We can now</text>

North direction must be marked on the sample, and also the horizontal level. 
If it is clear that the sample is taken from a rock setting that has been de-
formed one must also mark the relation between the reference horizontal and 
the original horizontal, or the orientation of the stratication (in sedimentary 
rocks). For example, if a sample is taken from marine strata that have been 
folded, one must measure the dip of the bedding plane. One must then also 
apply techniques that are well developed in structural geology to correct for the 
later deformation and retrieve the original inclination. 
Figure 3.12: Paleomagnetic orientations. 
Ideally, many samples are taken in a sedimentary or volcanic sequence so that 
the measurements represent, in fact, a time span of several thousands of years. 
In this way the eects of secular variation can be averaged out and one can apply 
the so called axial dipole assumption, see below. Core drilling perpendicular 
to the stratication is an eective way to do that, but the original azimuth 
required to determine the declination may not be preserved, for instance in a 
core of a deep marine sediment, so that only the inclination can be used. 
Presentation of inclination and declination 
The angular information can be used in two ways. 
	Bauer plots: these are plots (named after Bauer) of the angle of inclination 
vs. declination. We have used them to illustrate the secular variation for 
London. 
	Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) plots. 
From the measured inclination I and declination D we can calculate (1) 
the magnetic co-latitude (i.e., the angular distance from the paleo-pole to 
the sampling site) and (2) the position of the paleomagnetic pole and the 
virtual (or apparent) geomagnetic pole (VGP). Lets see how we can do 
that. 
From the derivation of the potential of an axial dipole we know that the 
magnetic co-latitude m can be calculated from the basic equation for paleo-</text>

3.4	The magnetic induction due to a magnetic 
dipole 
Magnetic elds are fairly similar to electric elds, and in the derivation of the 
magnetic induction due to a magnetic dipole, we can draw important conclusions 
based on analogies with the electric potential due to an electric dipole. We will 
therefore start with a brief discussion of electric dipoles. 
On the other hand, our familiarity with the gravity eld should enable us to 
deduce dierences and similarities of the magnetic eld and the gravity eld as 
well. In this manner, we will start with the eld due to a magnetic dipole  the 
simplest conguration in magnetics  in a straightforward analysis based on 
experiments, and subsequently extend this to the eld induced by higher-order 
poles: quadrupoles, octopoles, and so on. The equivalence with gravitational 
potential theory will follow from the fact that both the gravitational and the 
magnetic potential are solutions to Laplaces equation. 
The electric eld due to an electric dipole 
The law obeyed by the force of interaction of point charges q (in vacuum) was 
established experimentally in 1785 by Charles de Coulomb. Coulombs Law 
can be expressed as: 
q0q 1 q0qF = Ke r = 	 (3.3) r2 4/epsilon10 r2 r, 
where r is the unit vector on the axis connecting both charges. This equation 
is completely analogous with the gravitational attraction between two masses, 
as we have seen. Just as we dened the gravity eld g to be the gravitational 
force normalized by the test mass, the electric eld E is dened as the ratio of 
the electrostatic force to the test charge: 
F E = , (3.4) q0 
or, to be precise, 
F E = lim ,	 (3.5) 
q0 0 q0 
Now imagine two like charges of opposite sign +p and p, separated by a 
distance d, as in Figure 3.2. At a point P in the equatorial plane, the electrical 
elds induced by both charges are equal in magnitude. The resulting eld is 
antiparallel with vector m. If we associate a dipole moment vector m with this</text>

CRM  Chemical Remanent Magnetization 
Some ferro- or ferri- magnetic minerals may be formed long after the rocks 
rst cooled below the Curie temperature. For instance, magnetite may oxi-
dize to hematite which then can settle as cement in the matrix between the 
grains. Conversely, magnetite may be formed from hematite in a reducing en-
vironment. Upon the chemical reactions and renewed deposition the minerals 
are re-magnetized in the then ambient eld. In these examples the CRM is 
very strong. Since the acquisition of CRM does not involve any reheating up to 
the Curie temperature (which is typically above the blocking temperature for 
radioisotope dating!) it is not possible to put a time tag on and it can not be 
used for paleomagnetism. 
IRM = Isothermal Remanent Magnetization 
Exposure of a magnetized sample to very strong eld even without increasing 
the temperature (for long enough time) can result in the re-arrangement of part 
of the initial TRM. IRM is characterized by a very narrow hysteresis curve so 
that the magnetization is relatively weak. An important source for IRM are 
lightning strikes. 
VRM  Viscous Remanent Magnetization 
Results from the slight reorganization of the magnetic moment in some grains 
if the grain is exposed to an ambient eld for a very long time. The external 
eld can diuse into the sample, in particular if both  and  are large.

are thus a nuisance; if the secondary remanence is soft their eects can be</text>

than 1 to 5 year are attributed to core ow, although this rule of thumb 
is ad hoc. 
The core eld has the following characteristics: 
1. 90% of the eld at the Earths surface can be described by a dipole in-
clined at about 11 to the Earths spin axis. The axis of the dipole in-
tersects the Earths surface at the so-called geomagnetic poles at about 
(78.5N, 70W) (West Greenland) and (75.5S, 110E). In theory the an-
gle between the magnetic eld lines and the Earths surface is 90 at the 
poles but owing to local magnetic anomalies in the crust this is not nec-
essarily the case in real life. 
The dipole eld is represented by the degree 1 (l =1 ) t e r m s i n t h e h a r-
monic expansion. From the spherical harmonic expansion one can see 
immediately that the potential due to a dipole attenuates as 1 over r2 . 
2. The	remaining 10% is known as the non-dipole eld and consists of 
a quadrupole (l = 2), and octopole (l = 3), etc. We will see that at 
the core-mantle-boundary the relative contribution of these higher degree 
components is much larger! 
Note that the relative contribution 90%10% can change over time as 
part of the secular variation. 
3. The strength of the Earths magnetic eld varies from about 60,000 nT at 
the magnetic pole to about 25,000 nT at the magnetic equator. (1nT = 
1 =1 01 Wb m2). 
4. Secular variation:	 important are the westward drift and changes in the 
strength of the dipole eld. 
5.	The eld is probably not completely independent from the mantle. Core-
mantle coupling is suggested by several observations (i.e., changes of the 
length of day, not discussed here), by the statistics of eld reversals, and 
by the suggested preferential reversal paths.</text>

Intermezzo 3.5 Spheroidal, toroidal, poloidal 
The following will help understanding the terminology. An arbitrary vector eld 
T on the surface of a unit sphere can be represented in terms of three scalar 
elds U , V and W as follows: 
u =  r  1 W, (3.67) rU + 1 V  
where the operator 1 is the dimensionless surface gradient on the unit sphere,
formed by taking the projection of the real gradient onto the plane tangent
to the surface.
A vector eld of the form 
rU + 1V is said to be spheroidal (i.e. having both 
radial and tangential components) whereas one of the form r  1 W is said 
to be toroidal. A toroidal eld is purely tangential. It resembles a torus which 
is purely circular about the z-axis of a sphere (i.e., follows lines of latitude). 
The curl of a toroidal eld (its rotation), is, by denition, poloidal . A poloidal 
eld resembles a magnetic multipole which has a component along the z-axis of 
a sphere and continues along lines of longitude.</text>

the magnetic dipoles is zero. However, if the number of orbital electrons is odd 
there is a small net magnetic moment that can be aligned with the external eld. 
This is known as paramagnetism. Atoms with an even number of electrons tend 
to be diamagnetic and those with an odd number tend to be both paramagnetic 
and diamagnetic. Like diamagnetism, the eect is small: || &lt; 104 so that 
Binduced  Bfree space. 
The susceptibilities of para- and dia- magnetic minerals are virtually inde-
pendent of the ambient eld (which gives a linear behavior in the above dia-
grams) but paramagnetism is strongly temperature dependent because thermal 
uctuations tend to disorient the alignment with the applied eld (competition 
between thermal energy that tends to destroy alingment and magnetic energy 
that tends to create it). The Curie Law states that paramagnetic susceptibility 
is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature. 
Ferro- and ferri- magnetism 
This type of magnetism can result in a remanent magnetization which re-
mains even after the ambient eld H changes at a later time. The susceptibility 
of ferro- and ferri- magnetic minerals depends strongly on the applied external 
eld, but in general  /greatermuch 0. In ferromagnetic minerals the electron spins line 
up spontaneously. Perfect line-up occurs only in a few metals, such as metallic 
iron in the Earths core, and alloys; in other minerals, such as magnetite, the 
line-up is not complete which results in ferrimagnetism . 
Which minerals are important?

Ohms Law of Conduction 
A last important law is due to Ohm: it describes the conduction of current 
in an electromagnetic eld. Experimentally, it had been veried that a 
force called the Lorentz force was exerted on a charge moving in an electric 
and magnetic eld, according to: 
F = q(E + v  B) (3.54) 
This can be transformed into Ohms law which is obeyed by all mate-
rials for which the current depends linearly upon the applied potential 
dierence. Here  is the conductivity, in 1/(Ohm m). 
J = (E + v  B). (3.55) 
Intermezzo 3.4 Scalar potential for the magnetic field 
For a formal derivation of the relationship between the eld and the potential 
we have to consider two of Maxwells Equations 
H = J + tD (3.56) 
B = 0 (3.57) 
where H is the magnetic eld, B, the induction, J the electric current density 
and tD the electric displacement current density. We will use this in the discus -
sion of the geodynamo, but for the study of the magnetic eld outside the core 
we make the following approximations. Ignoring electromagnetic disturbances 
such as lightning, and neglecting the conductivity of Earths mantle, the region 
outside the Earths core (and in the atmosphere up to about 50 km) is often 
considered an electromagnetic vacuum, with J =0 a n d tD = 0, so that the 
magnetic eld is rotation free (H = 0). This means that H is a conservative 
eld in the region of interest and that a scalar potential exists of which H is the 
(negative) gradient (but watch out for normalization constants  well actually 
dene the potential starting from the magnetic induction B rather than from 
the eld H by saying that B = Vm ), where B = 0 H. With (3.57) it follows 
that such a potential potential must satisfy Laplaces equation (2Vm =0 ) 
so that we can use spherical harmonics to describe the potential and that we 
can use up- and downward continuation to study the behavior of the eld at 
dierent positions r from Earths center. 
The Magnetic Induction Equation 
In geomagnetism an important simplication is usually made, known as the 
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation : electrons move according 
to Ohms law (steady state), which means that tD =0 . N o w ,

that turbulence produces local changes in the direction of the helicity of 
the toroidal eld and thus the poloidal component, which may trigger a 
reversal. 
3. Reversals are not simply extreme cases of secular variation even though 
the distinction is vague. Growth, decay, and drift of the non-dipole eld 
and of the axial dipole are continuous, albeit possibly random, processes. 
Reversals, however, occur over time scales that are longer than the typ-
ical secular variations, but much shorter than the average time interval 
between reversals (&gt; 105 yr). In other words, statistically speaking rever-
sals do not occur as frequently as one might expect from the continuous 
(secular) uctuations of the main eld. It resembles a chaotic system that 
switches back and forth between two quasi-stable states. This behavior 
is nicely illustrated by measurements of the inclination, declination, and 
intensity during a reversal that characterizes the lower boundary of the 
Jaromillo event (a short N event in the Reversed Matuyama epoch docu-
mented near a Creek in Jaromillo, Mexico:

removed by techniques collectively known as magnetic cleaning. Cleaning is 
based on the principle that the soft components are destroyed while the strong 
original TRM or DRM is preserved. This can not always be guaranteed and, as 
a result, the intensity of the eld after cleaning may be unreliable. 
	Alternating eld cleaning (a.f. cleaning). Makes use of hysteresis prop-
erties of ferro- and ferri- magnetic minerals. The strength of a particular 
magnetization is determined by the width of the hysteresis curve, which 
represents the eld of opposed direction that would have to be applied to 
reduce the remanence to zero. The eld is often referred to as the coer-
cive force Hc (see hysteresis curve). In a.f. cleaning one exposes the eld 
sample to an alternating eld with diminishing strength and the sample 
is rotated in all directions. This process wipes out all components with a 
strength Hc that is less than the maximum eld applied. Of course, this 
only works if the primary component is stronger than that! This process 
must be performed in a laboratory set up where one compensated for the 
external Earth eld in order to avoid remagnitization along HE . 
	Thermal cleaning. Makes use of Curies law and Curie temperatures. The 
eld sample is heated to a particular temperature to destroy magnetization 
of minerals with Curie temperatures smaller than that value. This is, of 
course, only useful if the component youre interested in has a higher Curie 
temperature than the temperature that is applied. 
	Chemical cleaning: leaching or dissolving certain components of the rock, 
such a the hematite rich matrix in a sand stone. 
In general, one applies progressively stronger cleaning agents to the sample 
until the remaining eld is stable and no longer changes in direction. The 
intensity of the original TRM/DRM will be obscured in the process! 
3.14 Paleomagnetism 
A primary objective of paleomagnetism is to determine the history of the ge-
omagnetic eld (for a variety of purposes!) and what is needed is (1) hard 
(+stable) magnetization and (2) information about the time at which that mag-
netization was acquired. So, of the above mechanisms only TRM and DRM are 
useful since they have hard magnetization and the timing of acquisition of the 
RMs can be determined (radio-isotope dating and stratigraphy, respectively). 
Field practice: orientation of the sample 
One of the primary objectives is the measurement of the inclination and dec-
lination . One has to know where these angles  measured in a lab  refer to. 
Before the rock sample is taken from the eld one, therefore, has to make sure 
that its orientation in space at the sample site is known exactly. The current</text>

          <text>98 CHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH 
Table 7.1 of Stacey and eq. (3.43) we deduce that the relaxation time of 
the dipole is about 1000 years; in other words, the current rate of change 
of the strength of the dipole eld is about 8% per 100yr. Note that this 
represents a snapshot of a possibl y complex process, and that it does 
not necessarily mean that we are headed for a eld reversal within 1000yr. 
2. Change in orientation of the main eld: the orientation of the best tting 
dipole seems to change with time, but on average, say over intervals of 
several tens of thousands of years, it can be represented by the eld of 
an axial dipole. For London, in the last 400 year or so the change in 
declination and inclination describes a clockwise, cyclic motion which is 
consistent with a westward drift of the eld. 
3.	Westward drift of the eld. The westward drift is about 0.2a1 in some 
regions. Although it forms an obvious component of the secular variation 
in the past 300-400 years, it may not be a fundamental aspect of secular 
variation for longer periods of time. Also there is a strong regional depen -
dence. It is not observed for the Pacic realm, and it is mainly conned 
to the region between Indonesia and the Americas. 
Cause of the secular variation 
The slow variation of the eld with time is most likely due to the reorganization 
of the lines of force in the core, and not to the creation or destruction of eld 
lines. The variation of the strength and direction of the dipole eld probably 
reect oscillations in core ow. The westward drift has been attributed to either 
of two mechanisms: 
1. dierential rotation between core and the mantle 
2. hydromagnetic wave motion:	 standing waves in the core that slowly mi-
grate westward, but without dierential motion of material. 
Like many issues in this scientic eld, this problem has not been resolved 
and the cause of the secular variations are still under debate. 
3.9 Source of the internal eld: the geodynamo 
Introduction 
Over the centuries, several mechanisms have been proposed, but it is now the 
consensus that the core eld is caused by rapid and complex ow of highly 
conductive, metallic iron in the outer core. We will not give a full treatment 
of the complex issues involved, but to provide the reader with some baggage 
with which it is easier to penetrate the literature and to follow discussions and 
presentations.</text>

process to be eective and the electron spins are not aligned but cancel out. In 
this state the rocks are paramagnetic , and magnetization can only be induced 
by an external eld. If the assemblage is given a magnetization at time t0 the 
(induced) magnetization decays a et/0 where 0, the relaxation time, varies 
directly as grain volume (d3) and inversely as temperature T .I n o t h e r w o r d s , 
the relaxation time becomes shorter exponentially with increasing temperature. 
When the relaxation time 0 is very large (say 108 year) the remanence is said 
to be permanent. The dependence of the relaxation time on temperature and 
the grain size of single grain particles can be illustrated schematically: 
When the rock sample cools, the relaxation time and the susceptibility 
(Curies Law) increase (the width of the hysteresis curve increases) and there 
comes a point, at T = Tc, the Curie temperature (after Pierre Curie), at which 
the thermal agitation is no longer large enough to prevent alignment of the mag-
netic moments. At this point the assemblage of grains acquires a magnetization 
in the direction of the ambient eld, which upon further cooling becomes frozen 
in. This is known as ThermoRemanent Magnetization (TRM). 
The transition from a state of paramagnetism to TRM is not instantaneous 
and typically occurs over a certain temperature range. The process of acquir -
ing TRM consists of a series of partial thermo remanent magnetizations, each</text>

          <text>83 3.2. THE INTERNAL FIELD 
No mantle eld 
Why not in the mantle? Firstly, the mantle consists mainly of silicates and the 
average conductivity is very low. Secondly, as we will see later, elds in a low 
conductivity medium decay very rapidly unless sustained by rapid motion, but 
convection in the mantle is too slow for that. Thirdly, permanent magnetization 
is out of the question since mantle temperatures are too high (higher than the 
Curie temperature in most of the mantle). 
The core eld 
The temperatures are too high for permanent magnetization. The eld is caused 
by rapid (and complex) electric currents in the liquid outer core, which consists 
mainly of metallic iron. Convection in the core is much more vigorous than in 
the mantle: about 106 times faster than mantle convection (i.e, of the order of 
about 10 km/yr). 
Outstanding problems are: 
1. the energy source for the rapid ow.	 A contribution of radioactive de-
cay of Potassium and, in particular, Uranium, can - at this stage - not 
be ruled out. However, there seems to be increasing consensus that the 
primary candidate for providing the driving energy is gravitational energy 
released by downwelling of heavy material in a compositional convec -
tion caused by dierentiation of the inner core. Solidication of the 
inner core is selective: it takes out the iron and leaves behind in the outer 
core a relatively light residue that is gravitationally unstable. Upon so-
lidication there is also latent heat release, which helps maintaining an 
adiabatic temperature gradient across the outer core but does not eec-
tively couple to convective ow. The lateral variations in temperature in 
the outer core are probably very small and the role of thermal convection 
is negligible. Any aspherical variations in density would be annihilated 
quickly by convection as a result of the low viscosity. 
2. the details of the pattern of ow.	 This is a major focus in studies of the 
geodynamo. 
The knowledge about ow in the outer core is also restricted by observational 
limitations. 
	the spatial attenuation is large since the eld falls of as 1 over r3.A s a 
consequence eects of turbulent ow in the core are not observed at the 
surface. Conversely, the downward continuation of small scale features in 
the eld will be hampered by the amplication of uncertainties and of the 
crustal eld. 
	the mantle has a small but non-zero conductivity, so that rapid variations 
in the core eld will be attenuated. In general, only features of length 
scales larger than about 1500 km (l&lt;12,13) and on time scales longer</text>

Intermezzo 3.1 Units of confusion 
The units that are typically used for the dierent variables in geomagnetism are 
somewhat confusing, and up to 5 dierent systems are used. We will mainly use 
the Syst` es (S.I.) and mention the electromagnetic units eme International dUnit
(e.m.u.) in passing. When one talks about the geomagnetic eld one often talks 
about B, measured in T (Tesla) (= kg1 A1s2 ) or nT (nanoTesla) in S.I., or 
Gauss in e.m.u. In fact, B is the magnetic induction due to the magnetic eld 
H, which is measured in Am1 in S.I. or Oersted in e.m.u. For the conversions 
from the one to the other unit system: T = 104 G(auss)  1nT = 105 G= 
1 (gamma). B = 0 H with 0 the magnetic permeability in free space; 0 = 
4107 kgmA2 s2 [=NA2 = H(enry) m1 ], in S.I., and 0 =1 G O e i n 
e.m.u. So, in e.m.u., B = H, hence the liberal use of B for the Earths eld. 
The magnetic permeability  is a measure of the ease with which the eld H 
can penetrate into a material. This is a material property, and we will get back 
to this when we discuss rock magnetism. 
In the next table, some of the quantities are summarized together with their 
units and dimensions. There are only 4 so-called dimensions we need. These are 
(with their symbol and standard units) mass [M (kg)], length [L (m)], time 
[T (s)] and current [I (Amp` ere)].

3.3 The external eld 
The strength of the eld due to external sources is much weaker than that of the 
internal sources. Moreover, the typical time scale for changes of the intensity 
of the external eld is much shorter than that of the eld due to the internal 
source. Variations in magnetic eld due to an external origin (atmospheric, 
solar wind) are often on much shorter time scales so that they can be separated 
from the contributions of the internal sources. 
The separation is ad hoc but seems to work ne. The rapid variation of the 
external eld can be used to study the (lateral variation in) conductivity in the 
Earths mantle, in particular to depth of less than about 1000 km. Owing to 
the spatial attenuation of the coecients related to the external eld and, in 
particular, to the fact that the rapid uctuations can only penetrate to a certain 
depth (the skin depth, which is inversely proportional to the frequency), it is</text>

We apply the rotation operator to both sides and use the vector rule   
 () =  () 2 (). With the help of this and the Maxwell equations, Eq. 
3.58 can be rewritten as: 
H 1 = (v H)+ 2H (3.59) t 0 
This rephrasing of Maxwells equations is probably one of the most impor -
tant equations in dynamo theory, the magnetic induction equation .W e 
can recognize identify the two terms on the right hand side as related to ow 
(advection) and one due to diusion. In other words, the temporal change of 
the magnetic eld is due to the inow of new material, which induces new eld, 
plus the variation of the eld when its left to decay by Ohmic decay. 
It is interesting to discuss the two end-member cases corresponding to this 
equation, when either of the two terms goes to zero, that is. 
1. Infinite conductivity: the frozen flux 
Suppose that either the ow is very fast (large v) or that the conductivity 
 is very large (or both) so that the advection term dominates in eq. 
(3.59). 
tH =  (v H) (3.60) 
It is important to realize that H and v are so-called Eulerian variables: 
they specify the magnetic and velocity elds at xed points in space: 
H = H(r,t)a n d v(r,t). The partial derivative is not connected to a 
physical body. Now lets consider any area S bounded by a line C.T h e 
surface moves about with the velocity eld v. Consider the ux integrals 
of both sides of Eq. 3.60: 
 H n dS =  (v H) n dS (3.61) 
S t S 
Using Stokes theorem and the non-commutativity of the vector product, 
we obtain: 
 H n dS + H (v dl) = 0 (3.62) 
S t C 
Using a relationship known as Reynolds theorem, we can transform Eq. 
3.62 into: 
d H n dS = 0 (3.63) dt S 
This equation is called the frozen-ux equation . For any surface mov-
ing through a highly conductive uid, the magnetix ux B always stays</text>

of the then current magnetic eld (normal (N) or reversed (R))  the N-R 
pattern spreads away from the ridge. In this way the ocean oor acts as 
a tape recorder of the polarity of the Earths magnetic eld in the past. 
Initially, the time table based on land volcanics was correlated with the 
stripe pattern in the oceans, but this correlation was restricted to the 
past 5 Ma. Later, paleontological data (the fossil record) was used (along 
with radiometric calibration of land volcanics)) to extend the reversal time 
scale to ocean oor of Jurassic age (160 Ma). This was rst done in the 
south Atlantic where the time scale was extended to 80 Ma by assuming 
that the rate of sea oor spreading was constant in that time interval, 
an assumption that was later justied). With the increasing amount of 
data, the time scale is continually being updated. The time scale is very 
important for two main reasons: 
	Using the GPTS allows the calculation of sea oor spreading rates 
by measuring the distance between identied lineations. 
	Identication of the magnetic pattern of the sea oor and matching 
with the time scale can be used to date a piece of oceanic crust. 
3.18 Magnetic anomaly proles 
In order to exploit the time scales (for instance for points (a) and (b) above) one 
must be able to identify and interpret magnetic anomalies, or, more specically 
for marine surveys, magnetic proles due to a succession of magnetic anomalies 
with reverse polarity. In the interpretation one usually tries to nd a combina -
tion of N and R blocks that best matches the observed prole. This is easier 
said than done. A visual inspection of any of the proles used as illustrations in, 
for instance, it can be demonstrated that the relationship between the simplied 
block models and the corresponding magnetic proles is far from trivial. The 
magnetic proles look more complex than you would expect from the simple 
block models, and this is true not only for real data but also for the synthetic 
(computer generated) proles. 
In the rst place, the real sea oor is not magnetized in the form of regular 
geometric bodies. The geological processes at work in a mid oceanic ridge 
environment are complex and so are the resulting patterns of magnetization. In 
particular, the creation of new ocean oor in the so called emplacement zone 
is an irregular process that is not necessarily symmetric across the ridge axis. 
Also the spreading rate has an eect in that fast spreading (Pacic rise) results in 
wide zones with the same magnetization which facilitates identication, whereas 
slow spreading (Atlantic) produces narrow anomalies with poor separation of 
the anomalies, which complicates the analysis. 
But even for a regular alternation of N and R polarity, say in a computer 
model, the magnetic proles can be complicated. This is mainly due to the 
dipole character of the magnetic eld as opposed to the monopoles in gravity, 
which means that the orientation of the anomaly plays an important role.</text>

Figure 3.4: 
Geographic and geomagnetic reference frames 
It is useful to point out the dierence between geocentric (or geographic) and 
geomagnetic reference frames. 
In a geomagnetic reference frame, the dipole axis coincides with the z co-
ordinate axis. Since the dipole eld is axially symmetric, it is now symmetric 
around the z-axis. This implies that there is no longitudinal variation: no -
dependence. The components of the eld can be described by zonal spherical 
harmonics  in the upper hemisphere, eld lines are entering the globe, and 
they are leaving in the lower hemisphere. Only one Gauss coecient is neces-
sary: G0 or M/prime describe the dipole completely (curled letters used for dipole 1 z 
reference frame). See Figure 3.5(A). 
In Figure 3.5(B), the dipole is placed at an angle to the coordinate axis. To 
describe the eld, we need more than one spherical harmonic: a zonal and a 
sectoral one. Longitudinal -variation is introduced: m /negationslash= 0. We need three 
Gauss coecients to describe the dipole behavior: g1 , g1 and h1 0

harmonic rotation, resulting in a redistribution of the magnitude of the dipole 
over three instead of one Gauss coecients. 
The angle the magnetic induction vector makes with the horizontal is called 
the inclination I. The angle with the geographic North is the declination D. 
In a dipole reference frame the declination is indentically zero. 
Lets use Eqs. 3.16 and 3.29 to calculate the components of a dipole eld in 
the dipole reference frame for a few special angles.

acquired in a given temperature range, say, T1 &lt;T &lt;T2, and each preserving a 
record of the ambient eld in that time interval. Reheating to T1 would not de-
stroy that part of the remanent magnetization, but reheating to T2 would. This, 
in fact, underlies the principle of thermal cleaning . For most rocks containing 
a single, magnetic constituent the partial TRM acquired at about 50 below the 
Curie point is dominant. If the assemblage consists of a series of minerals with 
dierent Curie points the initial remanence can easily be overprinted with sec-
ondary components reecting the eld direction at some later time. For several 
minerals along the solid solution lines, the ternary system described above gives 
values of the Curie temperature Tc above which ferro- or ferri- magnetism is 
not possible. In general the Curie temperature decreases from right to left, i.e., 
hematite to ilmenite and from magnetite to ulvospinel. For hematite Tc=680 , 
for magnetite Tc=580, and for metallic iron (core!) Tc=770 . 
It is important to realize that the strongly magnetic minerals do thus not 
necessary result in a strong and stable (= long lasting) magnetization since their 
Curie temperatures can be so small that the original magnetization can easily</text>

Before we look at this in more detail, lets dene what we mean by a mag-
netic anomaly in the context of marine surveys. At sea one uses proton pre-
cession magnetometers (see, for instance, Garland, 1979) that are towed behind 
the ship. These instruments make use of the precession of hydrogen atoms after 
a strong (articial) ambient eld generated by a current in a coil surrounding a 
contained with many hydrogen atoms (e.g., water!) is switched o. When the 
initial eld that aligns the hydrogen dipole moments is switched o the hydro -
gen atoms precess with a frequency that depends on the strength of the ambient 
eld. The precession induces a current in the coil, which can be measured. Pre-
cession magnetometers measure the magnitude of the total magnetic eld, not 
its direction (which means that they do not have to be orientated themselves!) 
and have a sensitivity of about 1 nT. The magnetic anomalies are determined 
by subtracting the IGRF from the observed values. 
In vector notation, the total eld B is given by the contributions of the main 
eld (the core eld) BE and the magnetized body B: 
B = BE + B (3.87) 
But the scalar magnetometer measures 
B = |B| = BE + A (3.88) 
with A the magnetic anomaly.

Typically, B is of the order of several hundreds of nT whereas BE is of the 
order of 20,000 to 60,000 nT. Therefore we can safely neglect B2 so that 
B = {B2 
E +2BE .B} 1

with the unit vector BE in the direction of BE . The second term is small so 
that this expression can be expanded in a binomial series 
B  BE {1+ BE B|BE |1} = BE + BE  B (3.91) 
and we dene the magnetic anomaly A, see (3.88) as 
 A = B  BE = BE  B (3.92) 
In other words, the only components of the local eld B that we measure 
is the one parallel to the direction of the ambient (core eld). A vector diagram 
shows that this is a good approximation since B /lessmuch BE . (For a dipole, the eld 
3is given by the gradient of the potential B = V = (0/(4)1mrr}.)
Lets consider some examples in which BE is approximated by an axial
dipole. Assume an innitely long block (lineation) that is magnetized in the</text>

the true declination means that the VGP can  in principle  be anywhere 
along a small circle at an angular distance of m about the sample site. 
The true paleopole can then be found by the intersection of many such 
small circles and VGP estimates. The same applies to data from drill 
cores since one does not know the declination. 
Once the paleopole is known from many observations, this ambiguity disap-
pears, and from the known pole one can determine the magnetic (co-)latitude, 
or, in other words, the N-S motion of the sample site and the relative rotation 
about any axis other than the paleopole. 
3.15 Field Reversals 
For Earth, a reversal can be dened as a globally observed change in sign of 
the gaussian coecient g0
1that is stable over long (&gt; 5kyr) periods of time. 
Whats the relevance of studying eld reversals? 
	The alternating elds are recorded as magnetic anomalies in newly created 
ocean oor. This provides us with a fantastic dating device (the magnetic 
reversal time scale) and a very powerful tool to track past plate motions. 
	It may give us important clues and constraints for our understanding of 
core dynamics, the very origin of the main eld, and the possible mecha -
nisms of core-mantle coupling.</text>

Since Umonopole  1/r this expression means that the potential due to a 
dipole is the directional derivative of the potential due to a monopole. (Note 
that  is the angle between the dipole axis d and OP (or r) and thus represents 
the magnetic co-latitude .) 
Just as the Newtonian potential was proportional to GdM , the constant A 
must be proportional to the strength of the poles, or to the magnitude of the 
magnetic moment m = |m|A = Cpd = Cm. We have, in S.I. units, 
0m cos   0m r 0 m r Vm = = =	 (3.17) 4r2 4r3 4 r2 
3.5	Magnetic potential due to more complex con-
gurations 
Laplaces equation for the magnetic potential 
In gravity, the simplest conguration was the gravity eld due to a point mass, or 
gravitational monopole. After that we went on and proved how the gravitational 
potential obeyed Laplaces equation. The solutions were found as spherical 
harmonic functions, for which the l = 0 term gave us back the gravitational 
monopole. 
Magnetic monopoles have not been proven to exist. The simplest geometry 
therefore is the dipole. If we can prove that the magnetic eld obeys Laplaces 
equation as well, we will again be able to obtain spherical harmonic solutions, 
and this time the l = 1 term will give us back the dipole formula of Eq. 3.16. 
It is easy enough to establish that for a closed surface enclosing a magnetic 
dipole, just as many eld lines enter the surface as are leaving. Hence, the 
total magnetic ux should be zero. At the north magnetic pole, your test 
dipole will be attracted, whereas at the south pole it will be repelled, and vice 
versa. Remember how this was untrue for the ux of the gravity eld: an apple 
falls toward the Earth regardless if it is at the north, south or any other pole. 
Mathematically speaking, in contrast to the gravity eld, the magnetic eld is 
solenoidal .W e c a n w r i t e :

Using Gausss Divergence Theorem just like we did for gravity, we nd that 
the magnetic induction is divergence-free and with Eq. 3.14 we obtain that 
indeed

This equation is known in magnetics as Gausss Law; we will encounter it 
again as a special case of the Maxwell equations. We have previously solved Eq.</text>

constant. Note that the derivative is a material derivative: it describes 
the variation of the ux through a moving surface while it is moving!T h e 
eld lines do not move with respect to the owing material: there is no 
change in the electromagnetic eld within a perfect conductor. This is 
one of the fundamental approximations used to make problems in dy-
namo theory tractable and it underlies many computational and theoret -
ical developments in geomagnetism. While it simplies the very complex 
magneto-hydrodynamic theory, it is now known that it is probably not 
correct. In particular, if one wants to describe eects on a somewhat 
longer time scale, say longer than several tens of years, one has to account 
for diusion . However, for the description of relatively fast processes the 
application of the frozen-ux approximation is appropriate. 
2. No flow: diffusion (decay) of the field 
Suppose that either there is no ow (v = 0) or that the conductivity  
is very low. In both cases the diusion term in eq. (3.59) ((0)12H) 
will control the temporal variation in H. Eectively, eq. (3.59) can be 
rewritten as the (vector) diusion equation 
tH =(0)12H (3.64) 
which means that H (=|H|) decays exponentially with time at a rate 
(0)1 =  1,w h e r e  is the decay time of the eld. The decay time  
increases with conductivity , but unless we consider a superconductor, 
the eld will decay. For the earth, this case would represent the situation 
that the main eld is due to some primordial eld and that no core ow 
is involved. For realistic numbers, the geomagnetic eld would cease to 
exist after several tens of thousands of years. 
This is a very important conclusion, since it means that the magnetic eld 
has to be sustained ! because otherwise it dies out relatively quickly (on 
the geological time scale). This is one of the primary requirements of a 
geodynamo : it has to sustain itself ! (by means of scenario 2) 
The diusion equation also shows that the depth to which the ambient eld 
can penetrate into conducting material is a function of frequency. This is 
an important concept if one wants to use uctuating elds to constrain 
the conductivity or if one studies the propagation of changes in core eld 
through the conducting mantle and crust. 
Consider a magnetic eld that varies over time with a certain frequency 
 (in practice we would use a Fourier analysis to look at the dierent 
frequencies), diusing into a half-space with constant conductivity .I t 
is straightforward to show that a solution of the vector diusion equation 
is

is known as the demagnetized state. The size of the single domains in such ag-
glomerates depends on susceptibility and are larger in hematite than in, say, the 
titanomagnetites (see below). When placed in an ambient eld H the bound -
aries between the domains may migrate in such a way as to enlarge the domains 
that are favorably oriented with respect to the external eld, and this may cause 
magnetic remanence. The process of cell boundary migration is (energetically 
speaking) an easier process than the realignment of the direction of magneti -
zation and, as a consequence, large multidomain grains are magnetically soft 
(i.e. not stable over long periods of time and sensitive to later changes in the 
orientation and strength of the ambient eld). 
In contrast, single domain grains have the same direction of spontaneous 
magnetization throughout, and if they are not in contact with neighboring grains 
they cannot form closed loops and they can more easily be magnetized to sat-
uration. 
At high temperatures (or for very small single grains) the kinetic energy, or 
the thermal agitation, of the system can be too large for any kind of cooperative</text>

important properties of the minerals in the ternary diagram are: Curie tem-
peratures decrease from right to left; generally, the susceptibility increases from 
right to left. Even though, for instance, magnetite has a lower susceptibility 
than, say ulvospinel , it is more suitable for paleomagnetic studies, because uit 
maintains its remanence up to much higher temperatures. 
Intermezzo 3.6 Magnetic hysteresis 
When a ferromagnetic body (or an assemblage of asymmetric single grains) 
is placed in an ambient eld the magnetization will initially increase linearly 
with the strength of the ambient eld. This linear part of the magnetization is 
reversible and the sample will return to its original state when the ambient eld 
is removed. The initial susceptibility is then dened as  =(dM/dH )|.I f t h e t=0
external eld increases in strength saturation will occur, for instance because no 
more magnetic domains within a rock can be aligned, and the magnetization M 
rotates into the direction of the ambient eld H. This part of the process in non-
reversible: if the ambient eld is removed, there may be some relaxation (the 
reversible part) but a remanent magnetization MR will remain. If the external 
eld would change directions a hysteresis the magnetization would follow a 
hysteresis curve. The strength of the magnetization depends on grain size and 
temperature: the larger the single grains and the lower the temperature, the 
wider the hysteresis curve and the stronger (harder) the magnetization. See 
Figure 3.8.

Intermezzo 3.2 Magnetic field induced by electrical 
current 
There is no such thing as a magnetic charge or mass or monopole that 
would make a magnetic force a law similar to the law of gravitational or electro -
static attraction. Rather, the magnetic induction is both dened and measured 
as the force (called the Lorentz forcea) acting on a test charge q0 that travels 
through such a eld with velocity v. 
F = q0(E + v  B) (3.11) 
On the other hand, it is observed that electrical currents induce a magnetic 
eld, and to describe this, an equation is found which resembles the electric 
induction to to a dipole. The idea of magnetic dipoles is born. In 1820, the 
French physicists Biot and Savart measured the magnetic eld induced by an 
electrical current. Laplace cast their results in the following form: 
0 dl  r dB(P )= i . (3.12) 4 r2 
An innitesimal contribution to the magnetic induction dB due to a line seg-
ment l through which ows a current i is given by the cross product of that 
line segment (taken in the direction of the current ow) and the unit vector 
connecting the dl to point P . 
For a point P on the axis of a closed circular current loop with radius R,t h e 
total induced eld B can be obtained as: 
0 R2 0 |m|B = i = . (3.13) 2 r3 2 r3 
In analogy with the electrical eld, a dipole moment m is associated with the 
current loop. Its magnitude if given as |m| = R2 i, i.e. the current times the 
area enclosed by the loop. m lies on the axis of the circle and points according 
in the direction a corkscrew moves when turned in the direction of the current 
(the way you nd the direction of a cross product). Note how similar Eq. 3.13 
is to Eq. 3.6: the simplest magnetic conguration is that of a dipole. 
The denition of electric or gravitational potential energy is work done per 
unit charge or mass. In analogy to this, we can dene the magnetic potential 
increment as: 
dV = B  dl  B = V (3.14) 
What is the potential at a point P due to a current loop? Using Eq. 3.12, we 
can write Eq. 3.14 as: 
0 dl/prime  r dV (P )=  i  dl. (3.15) 4 r2 
Working this out (this takes a little bit of math) for a current loop small in 
diameter with respect to the distance r to the point P and introducing the 
magnetic dipole moment m as done above, we obtain for the magnetic potential 
due to a magnetic dipole: 
0 m  r V (P )= . (3.16) 4 r2

Obtaining the magnetic eld from the potential 
Weve seen in Eq. 3.14 that the magnetic induction is the gradient of the mag-
netic potential. It is certainly more convenient to express the eld in spherical 
coordinates. To this end, we remind the reader of the spherical gradient opera-
tor: 
r   =  + 1  + 1 . (3.28) r r r sin   
In other words, the three components of the magnetic induction in terms of 
the magnetic potential are given by:

3.10 Crustal eld and rock magnetism 
From spherical harmonic analysis it is clear that short wavelength magnetic 
anomalies must have a shallow origin. Within the outer few km of the Earth 
are rocks with minerals that have ferromagnetic properties. The study of these 
rocks and their magnetization has two important applications in geophysics: 
	These rocks distort the magnetic eld due to the core and the induced 
local eld can be used to investigate crustal structures. (Note that we 
have seen that the downward continuation of the crustal eld obscures 
the higher degree components of the core eld at the CMB). 
	Some of these rocks exhibit permanent magnetization (= remanent mag-
netization with very long, i.e. &gt; 108 yr, relaxation times) and eectively 
provide an invaluable record of the history of the magnetic eld and the 
relative motion of tectonic units  paleomagnetism . 
Before discussing paleomagnetism we need to know some of the basics of 
rock magnetism in order to study the local eld. In particular: 
	What are the possible sources of magnetization and what are the condi-
tions that result in a strong, stable magnetization? 
	What are the important rock types and minerals? 
	What are the essential aspects of sample preparation before any accurate 
paleomagnetic measurements can be done? (I will discuss this only briey.) 
The physics of the magnetization of an assemblage of rocks is not simple. 
Traditionally, the French have played a major role in research of magnetism, 
and L. Neel was awarded a Nobel prize for his pioneering theoretical work on 
rock magnetism. 
3.11 Magnetization 
Strength of magnetization: permeability and susceptibility 
Lets start from one of Maxwells equations. Remember that 
   H = Jmac + D,	 (3.68) t 
where H is the magnetic eld strength and Jmac and D are the macroscopic 
current and displacement current densities, respectively. Lets forget about the 
displacement current density for a moment (like in the magnetohydrodynamic 
assumption). The displacement current is usually spread out over large areas 
and hence D and also  D can be neglected. t 
In a vacuum, the only current one needs to worry about is the macroscopic 
current. In real materials (such as rocks), the atoms and molecules that make</text>

          <text>109 3.11. MAGNETIZATION 
Examples of induced magnetization are diamagnetism and paramagnetism . 
The elds are weak and decay rapidly when the external eld is removed (by 
means of diusion). 
Diamagnetism 
All materials tend to repel the magnetic eld lines of force so that the density 
of eld lines within the body (|Bi|) is smaller than outside (|Bo|): 
Bi = 0(1 + )|H|&lt;B o = 0|H|(1 + ) &lt;1 &lt;0 (3.78) 
This eect, which is controlled by orbital dipole moments can be explained 
by Lenzs Law, which states that the eld produced by a conductor moving 
into a magnetic eld tends to oppose the external eld. Here, the induced eld 
produced by the electron orbits tends to oppose the external eld. Even though 
all materials are diamagnetic, in some the eect is completely overshadowed by 
much stronger eects such as ferrimagnetism. 
Diamagnetism is a weak eect ||&lt;106 so that Binduced Bfree space. 
Owing to diusion, the original state is quickly restored when the external 
eld H would be removed unless the conductivity  is very large (supercon -
ductors) so that the diusion (which scales as 1/,s e e magnetic induction 
equation ) can be neglected. 
Paramagnetism 
Intrinsic paramagnetism is relevant for only a small class of materials, but 
most magnetic minerals are paramagnetic above the curie temperature (see 
below). Paramagnetic minerals tend to concentrate the lines of force so that 
the induced internal eld B is larger than the external eld H. 
Bi = 0(1 + )|H|&gt;B o = 0|H|(1 + ) &gt;1 &gt;0 (3.79) 
Electrons spin in opposite directions giving rise to spin dipole moments in 
opposite directions. The spins are arranged in pairs so that the net eect of</text>

also understand why the crustal eld poses a problem if one wants to study the 
core eld at the CMB for degrees l&gt; 14: these high degree components will be 
strongly amplied upon downward continuation and for high harmonic degrees 
the core eld at the CMB will be contaminated with the crustal eld! 
3.8 Secular variation 
Secular variation is loosely used to indicate slow changes with time of the geo-
magnetic eld (declination, inclination, and intensity) that are (probably) due 
to the changing pattern of core ow. The term secular variation is commonly 
used for variations on time scales of 1 year and longer. This means that there is 
some overlap with the temporal eects of the external eld, but in general the 
variations in external eld are much more rapid and much smaller in amplitude 
so that confusion is, in fact, small. From measurements of the components H, 
Z,a n d E, at regular time intervals one can also determine the time derivatives 
tgm gm and thm = hm, and, if need be, also the higher order derivatives. l =l l l 
The values of gm and hm averaged over a particular time interval along with the l l 
time derivatives glm and hm determine the International Geomagnetic Reference l 
eld (IGRF), which is published in map and tabular form every 5 year or so. 
Temporal variations in the internal eld are modeled by expanding the Gauss 
coecients in a Taylor series in time about some epoch te, e.g., 
/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg /vextendsingle 
g m 
e (t)= g m 
e (te)+ g 
t /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle (t  te) 
te /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg /vextendsingle 2g /vextendsingle (t  te)2 
+ /vextendsingle + higher-order terms (3.41) t2 /vextendsingle 2!te 
Most models include only the rst two terms on the right-hand side, but 
sometimes it is necessary to include the third derivative term as well, for dis-
tance, in studies of magnetic jerks. 
Similar to the mean square of the surface eld, we can dene a mean square 
value of the variation in time of the eld at degree l: 
m)2Il =(l +1 ) [( g +(hm)2] (3.42) l l 
and the relaxation time l for the degree l component as 
Ill = 
Il (3.43) 
There are at least three important phenomena: 
1. Change in the strength of the dipole. We can infer that for the dipole, 
the coecients gm and hm are all of opposite sign than those of the main l l 
eld. This indicates a weakening of the dipole eld. From the numbers in 1

          <text>126 CHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH 
makes up for about 90% of the eld and that the non-dipole component 
is only about 10% . So although the eld reduces to about 30% of its 
original strength, the dipolar component cannot be neglected during re-
versals. These numbers are, however, not yet well constrained. Some data 
(and numerical models) suggest a reduction during reversal to about 10% 
of the original strength, which would either imply that the dipole com-
ponent has become negligible or that if there still is a dipolar eld also 
the non-dipole components must signicantly reduce in strength. The ob-
servational evidence is problematic because [1] the non-dipole eld at the 
surface is so much weaker than it is at the CMB and [2] because a reversal 
is a relatively short phenomenon (say 5,000 yr) and it is hard to get the 
time resolution in volcanic or sedimentary strata. 
2.	A closely related question is: can a non-dipole eld produce continuous 
VGP paths during reversals? Are VGP paths random or are there are 
preferred longitudes along which the VGPs move from the one pole to the 
other, and what are the implications of the answer to this question for our 
understanding of core dynamics and core-mantle coupling? 
Mechanisms of reversals 
The mechanisms of eld reversals are still subject of spirited debate, but it is 
generally accepted that they are controlled by core dynamics. Some important 
constraints (and, indeed, the need for core-mantle coupling) can be inferred 
directly from general properties of the geodynamo and from studying the (sta-
tistical) behavior of the eld during and in between reversals. 
1. It is important to realize that the geodynamo does not care about the 
sense of the eld. The magnetic induction equation H/t = (v  
H)+( 4 0)12H is invariant to a change in sign of H. 
We have argued before that in the core we can largely ignore the diusion 
term, and it is clear that the (sign) of the changes in magnetic eld depend 
entirely on how the turbulent ow eld v interacts with the magnetic eld 
H. 
2. The typical relaxation time of core processes is much longer than the time 
interval in which most reversals take place. If the eld is not sustained by 
dynamo action, for instance if the velocity v in the above equation goes 
to zero, the eld will die out in several 104 years. The rate of reversals 
must mean that the core eld is actively destructed and regenerated. Part 
of dynamo theory is the complex interaction of and conversion between 
the poloidal and (unseen) toroidal eld. Dierential (radius dependent) 
rotation in the outer core stretches the poloidal eld into a toroidal eld; 
radial ow owing to compositional convection distorts the purely toroidal 
eld (and the coriolis force adds extra complexity in the form of helical 
motion) which gives a component along the poloidal eld. It is conceivable</text>

Intermezzo 3.3 Solenoidal, potential, irrotational 
A solenoidal vector eld B is divergence-free, i.e. it satises satises 
 B = 0 (3.21) 
for every vector B. If this is true, then there exists a vector eld A such that 
B  A (3.22) 
This follows from the vector identity 
 B =  ( A)= 0. (3.23) 
This vector eld A is a potential eld. For a function  satisfying Laplaces 
equation  is solenoidal (and also irrotational). An irrotational vector eld 
T is one for which the curl vanishes: 
 T =0. (3.24) 
Reduction to the dipole potential 
The potential due to a dipole is obtained from Eq. 3.20 by setting l =1a n d 
taking the appropriate associated Legendre functions: 
3 
V D a0 1 = r2 [g1 cos  + g1 cos  sin  + h1 
1 sin  sin ]. (3.25) 
This is valid in Earth coordinates, with the z-axis the rotation axis.The 
0coecients are (g1 ,g1 ,h1 0 1
1) and they represent one axial (g1 ) and two equatorial 
1components of the eld. (with g1 taken along the Greenwich meridian). At any 
point (r, , ) outside the source of the eld, i.e, outside the core, the dipole 
eld can be composed as the sum of these three components. 
Earlier, we had obtained Eq. 3.16, which we can write, still in geographical 
coordinates, as: 
0 1 x y z V = . (3.26) 4 r2 mx r + my r + mz r

the z-axis of our coordinate system (geomagnetic coordinates or axial dipole</text>

Next, consider an arbitrary point P at distance r from a nite dipole with 
moment m. In gravity we saw that the gravitational eld g (the gravitational 
force per unit mass), led to the gravitational potential at point P due to a mass 
element dM given by Ugrav = GdM r1 . We can use this as an ad hoc analog 
for the derivation of the potential due to a magnetic dipole, approximated by 
a set of imaginary monopoles with strength p. To get an expression for the 
magnetic potential we have to account for the potential due to the negative 
(p) and the positive (+p) pole separately.

sin a sin b sin d = = (3.82) sin A sin B sin D 
(Note that we used (d,D) instead of the (c,C) to be consistent with the use of 
D for declination.)

of geodynamo theory as we now know it. Later, in 1929 Matuyama published 
similar observations as Brunhes, but these also attracted little attention. This 
continued until well into the 50ies, by which time there was ample observational 
evidence for eld reversals. 
However, the necessity for eld reversals was debated and a major proponent 
of an alternative explanation was the French physicist Neel who showed that 
under certain conditions ferri-magnetic minerals could, in principle, be self-
reversing. Self-reversal can happen in a situation where you have a solid solution 
of magnetic minerals (or two at least) with dierent Curie temperatures (think 
of the hematite-ilmenite series). Then, when the sample cools the mineral with 
the highest Curie temperature, say mineral A, freezes in the ambient main eld 
while the minerals with lower Curie temperatures are still in paramagnetic state. 
If these paramagnetic minerals are very close to mineral A, the remanent eld of 
A can induce a eld in the other minerals that may be opposite of the direction 
of the main eld. This secondary eld becomes frozen in when mineral B cools 
below its own Curie temperature, etc. etc. In case the mineral with the lower 
Curie temperature has a larger susceptibility (and this is indeed the case for 
the minerals along the solid solution lines in the ternary diagram!) the reversed 
eld may dominate the combination of the ambient eld and the induced eld 
in mineral A, and the net eect would be opposite in direction of the main eld 
without requiring a reversal of that main eld. Even though it has been shown 
experimentally that self-reversal is possible, it requires very special physical 
conditions and it is NOT a plausible mechanism to explain the by then (mid 
50-ies) overwhelming evidence that reversals are quite common. 
Study of baked clays (or thermal aureoles of igneous bodies in general) at 
many sites world wide demonstrated that the direction of magnetization in the 
igneous body of the same age and the contact aureole were often the same but 
did not coincide with that of the adjacent non-metamorphosed rocks. It was 
found that the rocks showing reversals grouped in specic age intervals, and this 
argument became even more convincing when accurate radiometric techniques 
such as KAr dating were applied. The reversals appeared to be rather global 
phenomena and could be traced in volcanic rocks as well as in marine sediments. 
There appeared to be no chemical dierence between the rocks the exhibited 
normal and reversed orientations. 
By the time of the early 60-ies several important discoveries associated with 
sea oor spreading resulted in the general acceptance of eld reversals. 
Outstanding questions 
1.	What happens to the dipolar eld during reversals? Does the dipole eld 
decay to almost zero before it is regenerated in the opposite direction, or 
is the dipole eld perhaps weakened but still prominent during reversals? 
The measurement of paleointensity of the main eld is dicult and prone 
to large uncertainties (see also notes on magnetic cleaning). Yet, it is 
now well established that during reversals the intensity of the eld reduces 
by at least a factor of 3. Recall that in the present-day eld the dipole</text>

3.	Displacement current 
Weve seen that a time-dependent magnetic ux induces an electric eld. 
The reverse is also true: a time-dependent electric ux induces a magnetic 
eld. But a current by itself was also responsible for a magnetic eld (see 
Eq. 3.12). Both eects can be combined into one equation as follows: 
d 0 i + /epsilon10 E = B  dl	 (3.50) dt 
dThe term i is the conductive regular current. The term /epsilon10 dt E ,w h e r e /epsilon10 
is the permittivity of free space and has units of farads per meter = A2s4kg 
m3, also has the dimensions of a current and is termed displacement 
current. Instead of current i we will now speak of the current density 
vector J (per unit of surface and perpendicular to the surface) so that 
J  ds = i. We can also also use the denition of the electric ux S 
(analogous to Eq. 3.46) and write the electric displacement vector 
as D = /epsilon10E. Then, again using Stokes Law (Eq. 3.45) and dening 
B = 0H, we can write Maxwells third equation: 
   H = J + D	 (3.51) t 
4.	Electric flux in terms of charge density 
Remember how we obtained the ux of the gravity eld in terms of the 
mass density. In contrast, the ux of the magnetic eld was for a closed 
surface enclosing a dipole. For a closed surface enclosing a charge distribu -
tion, the ux through that surface will be related to the electrical charge 
density contained in the volume! This is a manifestation of the potential
(rather than solenoidal) nature of the electric eld.
We write
qE  dS = ,	 (3.52) 
S /epsilon10 
which, with the help of Gausss theorem (Eq. 3.19) transforms easily to 
Maxwells fourth law: 
  D = E	 (3.53) 
Its interesting to note that, in the absence of conduction or displacement 
current, the magnetic eld is both irrotational and solenoidal (divergence -
free):   B =0 a n d   B = 0. In that case, there is actually a theorem 
that says that B should be harmonic, satisfying 2B = 0. Hence, the 
Maxwell equations imply Laplaces equation: they are more general.</text>

3.16	 Qualitative arguments that explain the need 
for core-mantle coupling 
There are compelling reasons to believe that the mantle and the dynamic pro-
cesses in the mantle have a strong inuence on reversals (and thus perhaps on 
core dynamics in general). It is probable that core ow is too turbulent and 
chaotic to be able to organize systematic patterns in eld reversals. Reversals 
seem to be a random process in the sense that [1] N and R directions of the 
Earths magnetic moment occur equally often and [2] the probability that a 
reversal happens in the next t years is independent of the time since the last 
reversal. However, as mentioned above, the average time interval between re-
versals is much larger than expected from the continuous uctuations in the 
eld. Moreover, in the last 5 year several papers have been published that pre-
sented evidence for preferred reversal paths of VGPs along meridians through 
the Americas and through east Asia. The selection of the same VGP path over 
and over again seems to require that the core has some memory about what 
happened many thousands of years ago, which is not very likely. 
In contrast, the mantle, with its high viscosity has such memory since 
the mantle structure does not change much over periods that are smaller than 
1 Myr. For this reason, investigators have invoked a strong inuence of (or 
coupling with) the mantle. This coupling could be mechanical (topography on 
core mantle boundary) but that is not very likely. Alternatively, the coupling 
could be electro-magnetical; in this mechanism ux out of the core would be 
concentrated in regions where the conductivity of the lowermost mantle is lowest 
(see dynamo equation above!) and swept away from regions of high conductivity. 
Several investigators have related the patches of high and low mantle con-
ductivity to lateral variation in the thickness of the so called D layer and this 
structure is likely to be inuenced by ow in the entire mantle. This depicts a

3.17	 Reversals: time scale, sea oor spreading, 
magnetic anomalies 
We have talked in some detail about the implications of the reversals of the 
magnetic eld for our understanding of core dynamics and core-mantle cou-
pling. This is a eld of active research: rapid progress is being made, but many 
outstanding questions remain to be answered. About 30-35 years ago (rst half 
of the 60-ies) the reversals of the main eld played a central role in the devel-</text>

Figure 3.15: Location of paleopole. 
The coordinate (p,p) is the apparent position of the pole for a magnetic 
eld if the eld is dipolar. The pole determined from a single site is called 
the Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP). An important result from paleomag -
netism is that the non-dipole eld almost completely averages out over extended 
periods of time (10,000 yr +) and that the average of all the VGPs from rocks 
of about the same age cluster together about the rotation pole. The is summa -
rized in the Axial Dipole Assumption : if we consider suciently long time 
intervals the average VGP represents the paleopole or the paleogeographic 
pole. 
It was soon realized that the paleogeographic poles did not coincide with the 
current rotation pole and that the poles determined from samples of a dierent 
age do not necessarily overlap. This was initially interpreted as evidence that 
the poles must move, hence the (obsolete) name Polar Wander. We now know 
that the poles are xed and that the pole paths describe the relative motion of 
the landmass relative to the pole. A rotation of both the pole and the sample 
site (continent) about a rotation pole at the present-day equator at and angle 
of 90 from (p,p) gives the situation at the time of magnetization (assuming 
normal direction of the eld). For each separate tectonic unit, measurements 
from samples that are magnetized at dierent times determines give a series of 
VGPs which dene a pole path ,o r apparent polar wander (APW) path.</text>

the coecients for a eld due to a magnetized sphere or to a dipole. In fact, he 
also showed from a spectral analysis that the best t to the observed eld was 
obtained if the dipole was not purely axial but made an angle of about 11 with 
the Earths rotation axis. 
An outstanding issue remained: what causes the internal eld? It was clear 
that the temperatures in the interior of the Earth are probably much too high 
to sustain permanent magnetization. A major leap in the understanding of the 
origin of the eld came in the rst decade of the twentieth century when Oldham 
(1906) and Gutenberg (1912) demonstrated the existence of a (outer) core with 
a very low viscosity since it did not seem to allow shear wave propagation ( 
rigidity =0). So the rigidity problem was solved. From the cosmic abundance 
of metallic iron it was inferred that metallic iron could be the major constituent 
of the (outer) core (the seismologist Inge Lehmann discovered the existence of 
the inner core in 1936). In the 40s Larmor postulated that the magnetic eld 
(and its temporal variations) were, in fact, due to the rapid motion of highly 
conductive metallic iron in the liquid outer core. Fine; but there was still the 
apparent contradiction that the magnetic eld would diuse away rather quickly 
due to ohmic dissipation while it was known that very old rocks revealed a rem-
nant magnetic eld. In other words, the eld has to be sustained by some, at 
that time, unknown process. This lead to the idea of the geodynamo (Sir 
Bullard, 40-ies and 50-ies), which forms the basis for our current understanding 
of the origin of the geomagnetic eld. The theory of magneto-hydrodynamics 
that deals with magnetic elds in moving liquids is dicult and many approxi -
mations and assumptions have to be used to nd any meaningful solutions. In 
the past decades, with the development of powerful computers, rapid progress 
has been made in understanding the eld and the cause of the secular variation. 
We will see, however, that there are still many outstanding questions. 
Dierences and similarities with Gravity 
Similarities are: 
	The magnetic and gravity elds are both potential elds, the elds are 
the gradient of some potential V , and Laplaces and Poissons equations 
apply. 
	For the description and analysis of these elds, spherical harmonics is the 
most convenient tool, which will be used to illustrate important properties 
of the geomagnetic eld. 
	In both cases we will use a reference eld to reduce the observations of 
the eld. 
	Both elds are dominated by a simple geometry, but the higher degree 
components are required to get a complete picture of the eld. In gravity, 
the major component of the eld is that of a point mass M in the center 
of the Earth; in geomagnetism, we will see that the eld is dominated</text>

So for the magnetic North Pole, Equator and South Pole, respectively, we 
get the eld strengths summarized in Table 3.1. 
So the eld at the magnetic equator is half that at the magnetic poles, and at 
the North Pole it points radially inward, but outward at the geographic South 
Pole.</text>

When a magnetic body is placed in an external magnetic eld H the density 
of the eld lines inside the body depends on the strength of H and on the 
magnetization M induced by H. Thus, the magnetic susceptibility  indicates 
the ease with which a magnetic body can be magnetized in an external eld. 
Types of magnetization 
The magnetization of a mineral is controlled by intrinsic (i.e., material depen -
dent) magnetic moments of electrons spinning about their axes (spin dipole 
moments ) or the motion of electrons in their orbits about the atomic nuclei 
(orbital dipole moments ). There are several types of spin interactions that give 
rise to dierent magnetic eects. The following is a brief summary. 
Remanent or Induced? (Konigsberger ratio) 
When we talk about magnetization, we can broadly identify two types: 
1. Induced magnetization,	 MI , which occurs only if an ambient eld H is 
present and decays rapidly if this external eld is removed. This induced 
eld is very important in ore exploration. 
M2. Remanent magnetization, MR , which is the part of initial magnetization 
that remains after the external eld disappears or changes in character. 
R forms the record of the past eld and is the type of magnetization 
that makes paleomagnetism work. 
In natural rocks, the ratio between the two is known as the Konigsberger 
ratio Q 
Q = |MR|	(3.77) |MI | 
Rocks with high Q tend to be magnetically stable and are good recorders 
of the ancient geomagnetic eld. (I just remark at this stage that the strength 
of |MR | does not only depend on the composition (more precisely the type 
of magnetic minerals) but also on the grain size, and whether the magnetic 
particles consist of single or multiple grains). Rock types with high Q are most 
of the mac rocks, such as basalt and gabbro, and also granite. Limestone, for 
instance, typically has a very small Konigsberger ratio.</text>

owing to variations in composition or changes in stress due to buckling 
(folding) of the oceanic lithosphere (it was known since the large 1906 
earthquake in San Francisco that changes in the stress eld can inuence 
magnetization). 
3. At about the	same time, Dietz (1961) and Hess (1962) postulated the 
concept of sea oor spreading . Not as an explanation for the magnetic 
anomalies, but rather as a way out of the long standing problem that 
continental drift seemed unlikely because continents cannot move through 
the oceanic lithosphere. Dietz and Hess realized that the oldest parts of 
oceanic sea oor were less than about 200 Ma old, which is more than an 
order of magnitude less than the age of the oldest continental rocks. This 
suggests that oceanic lithosphere is being recycled more eciently than 
continental material. These scientists proposed that sea oor is generated 
at mid oceanic ridges (where pillow lavas had been dredged and high heat 
ow measured) and then spreads away carrying the continents with them. 
So the continents move along with the ocean oor, not through it!! 
In 1963 Vine and Matthews and, independently, Morley, put these ideas 
and developments (1-3) together and correctly interpreted the magnetic 
anomalies at the sea oor: new ocean oor is created at mid oceanic ridges

change the eectiveness of this protection. Major events in the evolution -

Discovery of eld reversals: a historical note 
TRM was well known in the 19th century. Evidence for eld reversals was rst 
reported in 1906 when the French physicist Bernard Brunhes discovered that 
the direction of magnetization in a lava ow and the adjacent baked clay was 
opposite of that of the current main eld. Brunhes concluded that the eld 
must have reversed, but that explanation was not generally accepted. Recall 
that at that time the origin of the main eld was still a mystery. In fact, it was 
in the same year 1906 that Oldham demonstrated the existence of a liquid core 
from seismological observations, and that discovery triggered the development</text>

direction of the ambient Earth eld. The magnetization direction can be de-
composed into components parallel and perpendicular to the strike of the block. 
It can be shown that the component /bardbl| to the strike does not contribute to a 
magnetic anomaly since the innitely small dipoles that make up the anomalous 
structure all lie head-to-toe and cancel out except for the ones near the end 
(which innitely far away (in other words, the eld lines never leave the body). 
In this geometry, the magnetized body only has magnetization in the directions 
 to the strike (say, in the x and z direction). Consequently, a N-S striking 
 anomaly magnetized at the equator will always have A = BE  B =0 s i n c e 
B is orthogonal to BE (or, more precisely, there is no non-zero component of 
B in the direction of BE . In contrast, lineations magnetized at the pole and 
measured at the pole have BE /bardbl|B so that there will be a strong signal centered 
over the anomaly. 
The eect of the orientation (which theoretically speaking gives rise to a 
phase shift) presents itself as a skewness of the anomalies (see diagram) which 
can be corrected for (for instance by reducing the anomaly to the pole, see 
diagram). 
In addition to these distortions due to the phase shift theres the eect 
of amplitude modulation . Amplitude modulation consists, in fact, of two 
contributions: 
1.	usually, the magnetized body (at the ocean oor) is several km beneath 
the vessel. The observed magnetic eld thus represents the upward contin -
uation of the eld at the source. As a result of the 1/r3 decay of the eld 
there is signicant spatial attenuation of the high frequency components. 
Sharp contrasts will be observed as more gradual transitions. 
2.	Since the magnetized body can be thought to consist of dipoles a homo-
geneously magnetized lineation will only display a magnetic anomaly near 
its ends; in between, the plus and minus poles cancel out (same argument 
as above) and no anomalous eld is measured. This results in an eect 
known as sagging . See diagram on next page.</text>

Maxwells Equations 
Maxwells Equations describe the production and interrelation of electric and 
magnetic elds. A few of them weve already seen (in various forms). In this 
section, we will give Maxwells Equations in vector form but derive them from 
the integral forms which were based on experiments. 
Two results from vector calculus will be used here. The rst we already know: 
it is Gausss theorem or the divergence theorem . It relates the integral 
of the divergence of the eld over some closed volume to the ux through the 
surface that bounds the voume. The divergence measures the sources and sinks 
within the volume. If nothing is lost or created within the volume, there will be 
no net ux through its surface! 
  T dV = n  T dS (3.44) 
V V 
A second important law is Stokes theorem . This law relates the curl of 
a vector eld, integrated over some surface, to the line integral of the eld over 
the curve that bounds the surface. 
  T dS = T  dl (3.45)

1. The magnetic field is solenoidal 
We have already seen that magnetic eld lines begin and end at the mag-
netic dipole. Magnetic charges or monopoles do not exist. Hence, 
all eld lines leaving a surface enclosing a dipole, reenter that same sur-
face. There is no magnetic ux (in the absence of currents and outside 
the source of the magnetic eld): 
B = B  dS = 0 (3.46) 
Rewriting this with Eq. 3.44 gives Maxwells rst law: 
  B =0 (3.47) 
2. Electromagnetic induction 
An empirical law due to Faraday says that changes in the magnetic ux 
through a surface induce a current in a wire loop that denes the surface. 
d d B = B  dS =  E  dl, (3.48) dt dt 
which can be rewritten using Eq. 3.45 to give Maxwells second law:

up the substance are like little magnetic dipoles with a dipole moment m:a 
hydrogen atom, for instance is little more than the primitive current loop we 
started the denition of the magnetic dipole moment with. The magnetization 
of a substance is dened as the volume density of all these little dipole vectors: 
m 
VM = lim . (3.69) 
V 0 V 
One can express the density of microscopic molecular currents Jmol through 
this magnetization vector as follows: 
  M = Jmol. (3.70) 
Hence we can rewrite Eq. 3.68 with both the macroscopic and microscopic 
current densities as follows (using B = 0H): 
  B = 0Jmac + 0  M, (3.71) 
which leads to 
B    M = Jmac. (3.72) 0 
Comparison with Eq. 3.68 shows that the eld strength in a material is given 
with respect to the macroscopic currents as: 
B H =  M, (3.73) 0 
It is customary to associate the magnetization not with the magnetic induc-
tion, but with the eld strength. It is assumed that this relationship exists: 
M = X  H. (3.74) 
The Greek capital letter chi (X) is used for the magnetic susceptibility tensor. 
It relates the three components of the internal magnetization to the applied eld, 
hence it is a second-order tensor (a matrix). This is usually a complex function, 
as X may depend on anything  temperature, grain size, H,s t r a i n a n d s o 
on. It can be negative, too. If X is a tensor, then H and M need not be 
collinear. Usually, the assumption of magnetic isotropy is made, and Eq. 3.74 
is approximated by a scalar relationship: 
M = H. (3.75) 
Now H and M are collinear, but the magnitudes and sense are regulated by 
the value and sign of . Because both H and M have dimensions of the eld, 
 is a dimensionless constant: the magnetic susceptility .</text>

by that of an axial dipole in the center of the Earth and approximately 
aligned along the rotational axis. 
Dierences are: 
	In gravity the attracting mass m is positive; there is no such thing as 
negative mass. In magnetism, there are positive and negative poles. 
Figure 3.1: 
	In gravity, every mass element dM acts as a monopole; in contrast, in 
magnetism isolated sources and sinks of the magnetic eld H dont exist 
(H = 0) and one must always consider a pair of opposite poles. Oppo-
site poles attract and like poles repel each other. If the distance d between 
the poles is (innitesimally) small  dipole. 
	Gravitational potential (or any potential due to a monopole) falls of as 
1o v e r r, and the gravitational attraction as 1 over r2 . In contrast, the 
potential due to a dipole falls of as 1 over r2 and the eld of a dipole as 
1o v e r r3 . This follows directly from analysis of the spherical harmonic 
expansion of the potential and the assumption that magnetic monopoles, 
if they exist at all, are not relevant for geomagnetism (so that the l =0 
component is zero). 
	The direction and the strength of the magnetic eld varies with time 
due to external and internal processes. As a result, the reference eld 
has to be determined at regular intervals of time (and not only when 
better measurements become available as is the case with the International 
Gravity Field). 
	The variation of the eld with time is documented, i.e. there is a his-
toric record available to us. Rocks have a memory of the magnetic eld 
through a process known as magnetization. The then current magnetic 
eld is frozen in a rock if the rock sample cools (for instance, after erup-
tion) beneath the so called Curie temperature , which is dierent for 
dierent minerals, but about 500-600C for the most important minerals 
such as magnetite. This is the basis for paleomagnetism. (There is no 
such thing as paleogravity!)</text>

Figure 3.16: 
Note that on VGP diagrams one plots the VGP position relative to a xed 
landmass but in reality the poles are the same and the landmass moves! 
The observation that the pole paths do not agree for dierent continents 
demonstrates that the continents must have moved relative to one another  
plate tectonic motion . Conversely, the dierence in pole paths can be used 
to reconstruct these movements, and this is one of the basic principles of plate 
reconstruction. 
Ambiguities in determination of VGPs and in reconstruct -
ing past plate motion 
The position of the VGP can thus be determined from measurements of the 
inclination and declination. There are, however, two important ambiguities. 
1. The position of the VGP (p,p) is invariant for variation in longitude of 
the sample site. The landmass can be anywhere along a small circle at 
an angular distance of m about the paleopole. Since many earth systems 
(for instance, climate) exhibit a high degree of rotational symmetry and, 
thus, primarily zonal variation, this ambiguity is dicult to solve. 
2.	The declination in the sense used above is poorly dened. In addition to 
rotation about the paleopole (which does not eect the calculation of the 
VGPs) the sample site may have been subject to rotation around a vertical 
axis nearby or through the land mass. In the latter case the uncertainty in Image removed due to copyright concerns.

opment of the concept of sea oor spreading, which resulted in the acceptance 
of plate tectonics. 
To appreciate the line of thoughts it is good to realize that by the end of 
the 50-ies there was no agreement on the issue of eld reversals, even though 
an increasing number of scientists had accepted the idea. At the same time, 
continental drift was still hotly debated. Since the idea was rst clearly postu-
lated by Alfred Wegener in 1912 it had been advocated by many scientists, for 
example the South African DuToit, but, in particular, in the US the concept 
met with continued resistance. A central issue was the driving force and the 
mechanism of continental drift; one did not believe it possible that continents 
would plow their way through the mac and strong oceanic lithosphere. 
1.	Initially, the evidence for reversals was mainly based on land samples
of volcanic rocks. It was recognized that rocks with the same magnetic
polarity grouped into distinct time intervals, and the boundaries of these
time windows could be dated accurately with radiometric methods. The
rst Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) was based on KAr and
40Ar/39Ar dating of rocks less than 5 Ma old. Based on the rst time
scales one dened epochs as relatively long periods of time of mostly
one polarity, and events as relatively short excursions or reversals of the
eld within the epochs. The rst (= most recent) epochs are named after
some of the pioneers in geomagnetism (Brunhes, Matuyama, Gauss, and
Gilbert); events are typically named after the location where it was either
rst discovered or where it is best represented (Jaromilla creek, Mexico;
Olduvai gorge, Tanzania). The current epoch is referred to as normal (or
negative since the magnetic moment direction is opposite of the angular
moment direction). As more data became available the time tables were
rened and it became clear that the distinction between epochs and events
is not so useful.
2. In the early 60-ies, marine expeditions and geomagnetic surveys resulted 
in the rst detailed maps of magnetic anomalies at the ocean oor. A 
stripe pattern formed by alternating strength of the magnetic eld (the 
anomalies were made visible after subtracting the values of the reference 
eld (IGRF)) was documented for the Pacic sea oor o the coast of 
Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia (Ra &amp; Mason, 1961), and for 
the Atlantic just south of Iceland. The origin of this pattern was, however, 
not known. Explanations included the lateral variation in susceptibility</text>

The Magnetic Field of the 
Earth 
Introduction 
Studies of the geomagnetic eld have a long history, in particular because of its 
importance for navigation. The geomagnetic eld and its variations over time 
are our most direct ways to study the dynamics of the core. The variations 
with time of the geomagnetic eld, the secular variations, are the basis for the 
science of paleomagnetism , and several major discoveries in the late fties 
gave important new impulses to the concept of plate tectonics. Magnetism also 
plays a major role in exploration geophysics in the search for ore deposits. 
Because of its use as a navigation tool, the study of the magnetic eld has 
a very long history, and probably goes back to the 12thC when it was rst 
exploited by the Chinese. It was not until 1600 that William Gilbert postulated 
that the Earth is, in fact, a gigantic magnet. The origin of the Earths eld has, 
however, remained enigmatic for another 300 years after Gilberts manifesto 
De Magnete. It was also known early on that the eld was not constant in 
time, and the secular variation is well recorded so that a very useful historical 
record of the variations in strength and, in particular, in direction is available 
for research. The rst (known) map of declination was published by Halley 
(yes, the one of the comet) in 1701 (the chart of the lines of equal magnetic 
variation, also known as the Tabula Nautica ). 
The source of the main eld and the cause of the secular variation remained 
a mystery since the rapid uctuations seemed to be at odds with the rigidity 
of the Earth, and until early this century an external origin of the eld was 
seriously considered. In a breakthrough (1838) Gauss was able to prove that 
almost the entire eld has to be of internal origin . Gauss used spherical 
harmonics and showed that the coecients of the eld expansion, which he 
determined by tting the surface harmonics to the available magnetic data at 
that time (a small number of magnetic eld measurements at intervals of about 
30 along several parallels - lines of constant latitude), were almost identical to

be altered during later thermal events (for some magnetic minerals this can 
happen at room temperature). Conversely, the weakly magnetic minerals may, 
in fact, produce very stable magnetization. Weak and strong refers to the value 
(small, large) of the magnetic susceptibility; stability refers to the time scales 
over which the magnetization can last, and this is more a function of grain size 
and the composition-dependent Curie and blocking temperatures. 
3.12 Other types of magnetization 
TRM  ThermoRemanent Magnetization 
In terms of later overprints, it is good to realize that the direction of TRM 
can be reset if the temperature is raised to above the relevant Curie temper -
ature during some later thermal event. Upon cooling a new TRM is frozen 
in. Often, however, reheating will also reset the dating clocks since the closure 
temperatures for minerals typically used for radio-isotope dating are often lower 
than the Curie temperatures for the iron oxides. (This is generally true for the 
minerals involved in KAr and Rb-Sr dating  hornblende (530), muscovite 
(350), biotite (280), apatite (350), but U-Pb dating is more borderline 
with the closure temperatures for several important minerals exceeding 600 , 
for instance Zircon at 750). As a consequence, the data can still be used for 
paleomagnetism; the magnetization just relates to a later thermal event. 
DRM  Detrital Remanent Magnetization 
When igneous rock is eroded and the magnetic constituent is deposited in 
suciently still water the magnetic grains that carry TRM from previous events 
may become aligned in the ambient eld. Since this type of magnetization is 
in fact based on previous TRM it can be a stable and strong magnetization 
which can be useful, provided that the time of deposition can be determined 
accurately. There are, however, several complications, for instance, the change 
in any lineation direction due to compaction may result in an underestimation 
if the inclination I and this would underestimate the paleolatitudes.</text>
