) is left 
unchanged. 
We thus &#64257;nd that none of the conserved quantities relaxes to equilibrium in the zeroth 
order approximation. Shear &#64258;ow and entropy modes persist forever, while the two sound 
modes have undamped oscillations. This is a de&#64257;ciency of the zeroth order approximation 
which is removed by &#64257;nding a better solution to the Boltzmann equation. 
III.I First Order Hydrodynamics 
While f10(&#65533; q, t)p,&#65533; of eq.(III.93) does set the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation 
to zero, it is not a full solution, as the left hand side causes its form to vary. The left hand 
side is a linear di&#64256;erential operator, which using the various notations introduced in the 
previous sections, can be written as 
p&#945; &#8706; F&#945; &#8706; L[f]&#8801; &#8706;t + &#8706;&#945; +F&#945; f = Dt + c&#945;&#8706;&#945; + f. (III.107) m &#8706;p &#945; m &#8706;c &#945; 
It is simpler to examine the e&#64256;ect of L on lnf10 . which can be written as 
lnf10 = ln /parenleft&#63724;ig

The characteristic time scale &#964;U for L is extrinsic , and can be made much larger than 
&#964;&#215;. The zeroth order result is thus exact in the limit (&#964; &#215;/&#964;U)&#8594; 0; and corrections can be 
constructed in a perturbation series in (&#964; &#215;/&#964;U). To this purpose, we set f1 = f10(1 +g), 
and linearize the collision operator as 
C[f1, f1] = &#8722; d3p &#65533;2d2&#65533;b|&#65533; v1 &#8722;&#65533; v2|f10(p &#65533;1)f10(p &#65533;2) [g(p &#65533;1) +g(p &#65533;2)&#8722;g(p &#65533;1 &#8242; )&#8722;g(p &#65533;2 &#8242; )] 
&#8801; &#8722;f10(p &#65533;1)CL[g]. 
(III.111) 
While linear, the above integral operator is still di&#64259;cult to manipulate in general. As a 
&#64257;rst approximation, and noting its characteristic magnitude, we set 
CL[g]&#8776; g. (III.112) &#964;&#215; 
This is known as the single collision time approximation, and from the linearized Boltz&#173;
mann equation L[f1] = &#8722;f10CL[g], we obtain

the above equation, we have anticipated the possibility of &#964;&#181; &#65533;&#964;K which arises in more = 
sophisticated treatments (although both times are still of order of &#964;&#215;). 
It is easy to check that /integraltext 
pf11 = /integraltext 
pf10 = n, and thus various local expectation d3&#65533; d3&#65533;

The calculation of averages over products of c&#945;&#8217;s, distributed according to the Gaussian 
weight of f10, is greatly simpli&#64257;ed by the use of Wick&#8217;s theorem , which states that expecta&#173;
tion value of the product is the sum over all possible products of paired expectation values, 
for example /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg 2kBT &#65533;c&#945;c&#946;c&#947;c&#948;&#65533;0 = ( &#948;&#945;&#946;&#948;&#947;&#948; +&#948;&#945;&#947;&#948;&#946;&#948; +&#948;&#945;&#948;&#948;&#946;&#947;). (III.116) m 
(Expectation values involving a product of an odd number of c&#945;&#8217;s are zero by symmetry.) 
Using this result, it is easy to verify that

At this order, we &#64257;nd that spatial variations in temperature generate a heat &#64258;ow that 
tends to smooth them out, while shear &#64258;ows are opposed by the o&#64256;-diagonal terms in the pressure tensor. These e&#64256;ects are su&#64259;cient to cause relaxation to equilibrium, as can be seen by examining the modi&#64257;ed behavior of the modes discussed previously.

As a &#64257;rst approximation, we shall assume that in local equilibrium , the density f1 at 
each point in space can be represented as in eq.(III.56), i.e. 
p&#8722;m&#65533; q, t))2 
f10(&#65533; q, t) = n(&#65533; q, t) 
3/2 exp &#8722;(&#65533; u( &#65533;. (III.93) p,&#65533;q, t) (2&#960;mk BT(&#65533; q, t)) 2mkBT(&#65533;
The choice of parameters clearly enforces /integraltext 
d3&#65533;1 = p/m&#65533;0 = &#65533; u, as required. p f0 n, and &#65533;&#65533;
Average values are easily calculated from this Gaussian weight; in particular 
&#65533;c&#945;c&#946;&#65533;0 = kBT&#948;&#945;&#946; , (III.94) m 
leading to 
P0 and &#949; =3 kBT. (III.95) &#945;&#946; = nkBT&#948;&#945;&#946; , 2 
Since the density f10 is even in &#65533; c, all odd expectation values vanish, and in particular 
&#65533;h0 = 0. (III.96) 
The conservation laws in this approximation take the simple forms 
&#63729; 
&#63732; Dtn = &#8722;n&#8706;&#945;u&#945; &#63732; &#63732; &#63732; &#63730; 1 mD

tT = &#8722; T&#8706;&#945;u&#945;3 
In the above expression, we have introduced the material derivative 
Dt &#8801; [&#8706;t +u&#946;&#8706;&#946;], (III.98) 
which measures the time variations of any quantity as it moves along the stream-lines set 
up by the average velocity &#64257;eld &#65533; u. By combining the &#64257;rst and third equations, it is easy 
to get 
Dt ln nT&#8722;3/2 = 0. (III.99) 
The quantity ln /parenleftbig 
nT&#8722;3/2/parenrightbig 
is like a local entropy for the gas (see eq.(III.67)), which according 
to the above equation is not changed along stream-lines. The zeroth order hydrodynamics thus predicts that the gas &#64258;ow is adiabatic. This prevents the local equilibrium solution

To demonstrate that eqs.(III.97) do not describe a satisfactory approach to equilib&#173;

uniform box (F &#65533;= 0), by setting

We shall next expand eqs.(III.97) to &#64257;rst order in the deviations ( &#957;, &#952;,&#65533; u). Note that to

Phonons correspond to vibrations of a solid medium. There are also (longitudinal) 
sound modes in liquid and gas states. However, even &#8220;empty&#8221; vacuum, can support &#64258;uc&#173;
tuations of the electromagnetic (EM) &#64257;eld, photons , which can be thermally excited at 
&#64257;nite temperatures. The normal modes of this &#64257;eld are EM waves, characterized by a 
wave-number &#65533;k, and two possible polarizations &#945;. (Since &#8711;E&#65533;= 0 in free space, the elec&#173;&#183; 
tric &#64257;eld must be normal to &#65533;k, and only transverse modes exist.) With appropriate choice 
of coordinates, the Hamiltonian for the EM &#64257;eld can be written as a sum of harmonic oscillators,

with &#969;&#945;(&#65533;k) = ck, where c is the speed of light. 
With periodic boundary conditions, the allowed wavevectors in a box of size L are 
k = 2&#960;(nx, ny, nz)/L where {nx, ny, nz}are integers. However, unlike phonons, there is 
no Brillouin zone limiting the size of &#65533;k, and these integers can be arbitrarily large. The 
lack of such a restriction leads to the ultraviolet catastrophe in a classical treatment: As 
there is no limit to the wavevector, assigning kBT per mode leads to an in&#64257;nite energy 
stored in the high frequency modes. (The low frequencies are cut o&#64256; by the &#64257;nite size of 
the box.) It was indeed to resolve this di&#64259;culty that Planck suggested that the allowed 
values of EM energy must be quantized according to the Hamiltonian

CV =(6n &#8722;3&#8722;r)kB, and CP = CV +kB =(6n &#8722;1&#8722;r)kB, (VI.7) 2 2 
are temperature independent. The ratio &#947; = CP/CV is easily measured in adiabatic 
processes. Values of &#947;, expected on the basis of the above argument, are listed below for 
a number of di&#64256;erent molecules. 
Monatomic He n = 1 r = 0 &#947; = 5/3 
Diatomic O 2 or CO n = 2 r = 2 &#947; = 9/7 
Linear triatomic O&#8211;C&#8211;O n = 3 r = 2 &#947; = 15/13 
Planar triatomic H/O\H n = 3 r = 3 &#947; = 14/12 = 7 /6 
Tetra-atomic NH 3 n = 4 r = 3 &#947; = 20/18 = 10 /9 
Measurements of the heat capacity of dilute gases do not agree with the above pre&#173;
dictions. For example, the value CV /kB = 7/2, for a diatomic gas such as oxygen, is only 
observed at temperatures higher than a few thousand degrees Kelvin. At room tempera&#173;
tures, a lower value of 5/2 is observed, while at even lower temperatures of around 100K, it 
is further reduced to 3/2. The low temperature value is similar to that of a monatomic gas, 
and suggests that no energy is stored in the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. These observations can be explained if the allowed energy levels are quantized.

Typical values of &#952;rot are between 1 and 10 &#9702;K, explaining the lower temperature shoulder 
in the heat capacity measurements. At very low temperatures, the only contributions come 
from the kinetic energy of the center of mass, and the molecule behaves as a monatomic 
particle. (The heat capacity vanishes at even lower temperatures due to quantum statistics, 
as will be discussed in the context of identical particles.) 
VI.B Vi brations  o f a Solid 
Attractive interactions between particles &#64257;rst lead to condensation from a gas to liquid 
at low temperatures, and &#64257;nally cause freezing into a solid state at even lower temperatures. For the purpose of discussing its thermodynamics, the solid can be regarded as a very large molecule subject to a Hamiltonian similar to eq.(VI.1), with n = N &#8811;1 atoms. We can 
then proceed with the steps outlined in the previous section. (a) Th
e classical ground state con&#64257;guration of the solid is obtained by minimizing the po&#173;
tential V. In almost all cases, the minimum energy corresponds to a periodic arrangement 
of atoms forming a lattice . In terms of the three basis vectors , &#710;a,&#710;b, and &#710; c, the locations of 
atoms in a simple crystal are given by 
&#65533; q &#8727; (&#8467;, m, n ) = &#8467;a&#710; +m&#710;b+nc&#710;&#8801;&#65533; r, (VI.24)

The di&#64256;erent Fourier modes are thus decoupled at the quadratic order, and the task

3 3 matrix K&#732;&#945;&#946;(&#65533;k) separately for each &#65533;k. The from of K&#732;&#945;&#946; is further restricted by &#215;
the point group symmetries of the crystal. The discussion of such constraints is beyond

In a classical treatment, each harmonic oscillator of non-zero sti&#64256;ness contributes kBT 
to the internal energy of the solid. At most, 6 of the 3 N oscillators are expected to have 
zero sti&#64256;ness (corresponding to uniform translations and rotations of the crystal). Thus, 
up to non-extensive corrections of order 1/N , the classical internal energy associated with 
Hamiltonian (VI.33) is 3Nk BT, leading to a temperature independent heat capacity of 
3kB per atom. In fact, the measured heat capacity vanishes at low temperatures. We can 
again relate this observation to the quantization of the energy levels of each oscillator, as discussed in the previous section. Quantizing each harmonic mode separately, gives the 
allowed values of the Hamiltonian as

The sum is restricted to wavevectors &#65533;k inside a Brillouin zone. For example, in a cu&#173;

The quanta of vibrational modes are usually referred to as phonons . Using the dis&#173;

/parenleftbigg where the integral is performed over the volume of the Brillouin zone, and the factor of 3 
comes from assuming the same sound velocity for the three polarizations. 
Due to its dependence on the shape of the Brillouin zone, it is not possible to give 
a simple closed form expression for the energy in eq.(VI.45). However, we can examine 
its high and low temperature limits. The characteristic temperature separating the two limits,

behave classically. The integrand of eq.(VI.45) is just kBT, and since the total number 
of modes is 3 N = 3V /integraltext B.Z. d3&#65533;k/(2&#960;)3, the classical results of E(T) = E0 + 3NkBT, and 
C = 3NkB are recovered. For T &#8810;TD, the factor exp( &#946;&#175; in the denominator of hvk) 
eq.(VI.45) is very large at the Brillouin zone edge. The most important contribution to 
the integral comes from small k, and the error in extending the integration range to in&#64257;nity 
is small. After changing variables to x = &#946;&#175;hv|&#65533;k|, and using d3&#65533;k = 4&#960;x2dx/(&#946;&#175;hv)3 due to

We can change variables from the original deformations {&#65533; ui}, to the amplitudes {u&#732;s},

the transformation from {&#65533; ui}to {u&#732;s}is unitary (preserving the length of a vector),

Only modes with a &#64257;nite sti&#64256;ness can store potential energy, and m is de&#64257;ned as the

some eigenvalues to zero: 
(a)	T ranslation symmetry: Since V(q &#65533;1 + &#65533; c, ,&#65533; q n + &#65533; c) = V(q &#65533;1, ,&#65533; q n), no energy is &#183; &#183; &#183;	 &#183; &#183; &#183;

corresponding three values of Ktrans are zero. 
(b)	R otation symmetry: There is also no potential energy associated with rotations of 
the molecule, and Krot = 0 for the corresponding sti&#64256;nesses. The number of rota&#173;
tional modes, 0 &#8804;r &#8804;3, depends on the shape of the molecule; for example, a rod 
shaped molecule has r = 2, as a rotation parallel to its axis does not result in a new 
con&#64257;guration. 
The remaining m = 3n &#8722;3&#8722;r eigenvectors of the matrix have non-zero sti&#64256;ness, and 
correspond to the vibrational normal modes. The energy per molecule, from eq.(VI.5), is

There are limitations to the applicability of classical statistical mechanics. The need 
to include quantum mechanical e&#64256;ects becomes specially apparent at low temperatures. 
In this section we shall &#64257;rst demonstrate the failure of the classical results in the contexts of heat capacities of molecular gases and solids, and the ultra-violet catastrophe in black 
body radiation. We shall then reformulate statistical mechanics using quantum concepts.

Consider a dilute gas of polyatomic molecules. The Hamiltonian for each molecule of 
n atoms is n /summationdisplay p &#65533;2 
iH1 =2m +V(&#65533; q1, . . .,&#65533; q n), (VI.1) 
i=1 
where the potential energy V, contains all the information on molecular bonds. For sim&#173;
plicity, we have assumed that all atoms in the molecule have the same mass. If the masses 
are di&#64256;erent, the Hamiltonian can be brought into the above form by rescaling the coordi&#173;
nates &#65533; qi by mi/m(and the momenta by m/m i), where mi is the mass of the ith atom. 
Ignoring the interactions between molecules, the partition function of a dilute gas is

The chemical bonds that keep the molecule together are usually quite strong (ener&#173;
gies of the order of electron volts). At typical accessible temperatures, which are much 
smaller than the corresponding dissociation temperatures ( &#8776;104 &#9702;K), the molecule has 
a well de&#64257;ned shape and only undergoes small deformations. The contribution of these deformations to the one particle partition function Z

The discrepancy is resolved through the Debye model , which emphasizes that at low 
temperatures the main contribution to heat capacity is from the oscillators of lowest fre&#173;
quency that are the most easily excited. The lowest energy modes in turn correspond to 
smallest wavevectors k = |&#65533;k|, or longest wavelengths &#955; = 2&#960;/k. Indeed, the modes with

&#65533; Relations between moments and cumulants can be obtained by expanding the logarithm 
of &#732;p(k) in eq.(II.7), and using 
&#8734; 
(&#8722;1)n+1 &#491;n 
ln(1 + &#491;) = . (II.10) n n=1 
The &#64257;rst four cumulants are called the mean, variance , skewness , and curtosis  of the 
d
istribution respectively, and are obtained from the moments as 
/an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}htc = /an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}ht,

The cumulants provide a useful and compact way of describing a PDF. 
An important theorem allows easy computation of moments in terms of the cumulants: 
Represent the nth cumulant graphically as a connected  cluster of n p oints. The mth moment 
is then obtained by summing all possible subdivisions of m points into groupings of smaller 
(connected or disconnected) clusters. The contribution of each subdivision to the sum is the product of the connected cumulants that it represents. Using this result the &#64257;rst four moments are easily computed as 
, /an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}ht= /an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}ht

x = x c + 3 x c /an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}htc + /an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}htc ,

c + 6 x 2

This theorem, which is the starting point for various diagrammatic computations is statis&#173;tical mechanics and &#64257;eld theory, is easily proved by equating the expression in eqs. (II.7) and (II.9) for &#732; p(k)

m! /an}bracketle{tx /an}bracketri}ht= exp n! /an}bracketle{tx /an}bracketri}htc = pn! n! . (II.13) 
m=0 n=1 n p n 
Equating the powers of (&#8722; ik)m on the two sides of the above expression leads to 
&#8242; &#65533; &#65533; m! /an}bracketle{tx m /an}bracketri}ht= pn!(n!)pn /an}bracketle{tx n /an}bracketri}htcpn . (II.14) 
{pn} n 
The sum is restricted such that npn = m, and leads to the graphical interpretation 
given above, as the numerical factor is simply the number of ways of breaking m points 
into {pn}clusters of n points.

&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; For example, a series of N = 100 , 200, 300 throws of a dice may result in N1 = 
19, 30, 48 occurrences of 1. The ratios .19, .15, .16 provide an increasingly more 
reliable estimate of the probability pdice({1}). 
(2) Subjective probabilities provide a t heoretical estimate based on the uncertainties 
re
lated to lack of precise knowledge of outcomes. For example, the assessment 
pdice({1}) = 1 /6, is based on the knowledge that there are six possible outcomes 
to a dice throw, and that in the absence of any prior reason to believe that the dice is 
biased, all six are equally likely. All assignments of probability in Statistical Mechanics are subjectively based.The consequences of such subjective assignments of probability have to be checked against measurements, and they may need to be modi&#64257;ed as more information about the outcomes becomes available. 
II.B One Random Variable 
As the properties of a discrete random variable are rather well known, here we focus 
on continuous random variables, which are more relevant to our purposes. Consider a random variable x, whose outcomes are real numbers, i.e. S
x = {&#8722;&#8734; &lt; x &lt; &#8734;}. 
&#8226; The cumulative  probability  function (CPF) P(x ), is the probability of an outcome with 
any value  less than x , i.e. P(x) = prob .(E &#8834;[&#8722;&#8734;, x]). P(x) must be a monotonically 
increasing function of x, with P(&#8722;&#8734;) = 0 and P(+&#8734;) = 1. 
&#8226; The probability  density function (PDF) is de&#64257;ned by p(x )&#8801;dP(x)/dx. Hence, p(x)dx = 
prob.(E &#8834;[x, x + dx]). As a probability density, it is positive , and normalized such that 
&#65533; &#8734; 
prob.(S) = dx p(x) = 1 . (II.1) 
&#8722;&#8734; 
Note that since p(x) is a probability  density , it has no upper bound, i.e. 0 &lt; p(x)&lt; &#8734;. 
&#8226; The expectation value of any function F(x ), of the random variable is 
&#65533; &#8734; 
/an}bracketle{tF(x)/an}bracketri}ht= dx p(x)F(x). (II.2) 
&#8722;&#8734; 
The function F(x) is itself a random variable, with an associated PDF of pF(f)d f = 
prob.(F(x)&#8834;[f, f + d f]). There may be multiple solutions xi, to the equation F(x) = f, 
and &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; dx &#65533; 
pF(f)d f = p(xi)dxi , = pF(f) = p(xi) . (II.3) &#8658; dF i i x=xi

&#65533; &#65533; is just the coe&#64259;cient obtained in the binomial expansion of ( pA+pB)N, and gives the num&#173;
ber of possible orderings of NA events A and NB = N &#8722;NA events B. The characteristic 
function for this discrete distribution is given by 
N &#65533; &#8722;ikN A &#65533; N! NA N&#8722;NA &#8722;ikN A &#65533; &#8722;ik &#65533;N p&#732;N(k) = e = pA pB e = pAe +pB . NA!(N &#8722;NA)!NA=0 
(II.21) 
The resulting cumulant generating function is 
ln &#732;pN(k) = N ln &#65533; 
pAe &#8722;ik +pB &#65533; 
= N ln &#732;p1(k), (II.22) 
where ln &#732; p1(k) is the cumulant generating function for a single trial. Hence, the cumulants 
after N trials are simply N times the cumulants in a single trial. In each trial, the allowed 
values of NA are 0 and 1 with respective probabilities pB and pA, leading to NA&#8467; = pA, 
for all &#8467;. After N trials the &#64257;rst two cumulants are 
/an}bracketle{tNA/an}bracketri}htc = NpA , &#65533; 
NA 2 &#65533; 
= N(pA &#8722;p 2 
A) = NpApB . (II.23) c 
A measure of &#64258;uctuations around the mean is provided by the standard  deviation, which is 
t
he square root of the variance. While the mean of the binomial distribution scales as N, 
its standard deviation only grows as &#8730;
N. Hence, the relative  uncertainty becomes smaller 
f
or large N. 
The binomial distribution is straightforwardly generalized to a multinomial  distribu&#173;
t
ion, when the several outcomes {A, B, , M }occur with probabilities {pA, pB, , p M}. &#183; &#183; &#183; &#183; &#183; &#183; 
The probability of &#64257;nding outcomes {NA, NB, , N M}in a total of N = NA+NB +NM &#183; &#183; &#183; &#183; &#183; &#183;
trials is 
pN ({NA, NB, , N M}) = N! p NA p NB p NM . (II.24) &#183; &#183; &#183; NA!NB!NM!A B &#183; &#183; &#183; M &#183; &#183; &#183; 
(3) The Poisson distribution: Th e classical example of a Poisson process is radioactive 
decay. Observing a piece of radioactive material over a time interval T shows that: 
(a) The probability of one and only one event (decay) in the interval [ t, t+dt] is propor&#173;
tional to dt as dt 0, &#8594;
(b) The probabilities of events at di&#64256;erent intervals are independent of each other. 
The probability of observing exactly M decays in the interval T is given by the Poisson 
distribution. It is obtained as a limit of the binomial distribution by subdividing the 
interval into N = T/dt &#8811;1 segments of size dt. In each segment, an event occurs with 
probability p= &#945;dt, and there is no event with probability q = 1&#8722;&#945;dt. As the probability

&#65533; The factors of dx/dF are the Jacobians associated with the change of variables from x | |
to F. For example, consider p(x) = &#955;exp(&#8722;&#955;|x|)/2, and the function F(x) = x2 . There 
are two solutions to F(x) = f, located at x&#177; = &#177;&#8730;f, with corresponding Jacobians 
| &#177;f&#8722;1/2/2|. Hence, 
&#65533;&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#955; &#65533; &#65533;&#65533; 1 &#65533;&#65533; &#65533;&#65533; &#8722;1 &#65533;&#65533; &#955;exp &#8722;&#955;&#8730;f PF(f) = exp f + = ,2 &#8722;&#955; &#65533; 2&#8730;f &#65533; 2&#8730;f&#65533; 2&#8730;f 
for f &gt; 0, and pF(f) = 0 for f &lt; 0. Note that pF(f) has an (integrable) divergence at 
f = 0. 
Moments of the PDF are expectation values for powers of the random variable. The nth &#8226; 
moment is 
n n mn &#8801; /an}bracketle{tx /an}bracketri}ht= dxp(x)x . (II.4) 
&#8226; The characteristic  function , is the generator of moments of the distribution. It is simply 
the Fourier transform of the PDF, de&#64257;ned by 
p&#732;(k) = &#65533; 
e &#8722;ikx&#65533; 
= dxp(x)e &#8722;ikx . (II.5) 
The PDF can be recovered from the characteristic function through the inverse Fourier transform 
p(x) =1 dkp&#732;(k)e 
+ikx . (II.6) 2&#960; 
Moments of the distribution are obtained by expanding &#732; p(k) in powers of k, 
&#8734; &#8734; 
n n p&#732;(k) = &#65533; (&#8722;ik)n 
x = &#65533; (&#8722;ik)n 
/an}bracketle{tx /an}bracketri}ht . (II.7) n! n! n=0 n=0  
Moments of the PDF around any point x0 can also be generated by expanding 
e ikx0 p&#732;(k) = &#65533; 
e &#8722;ik(x&#8722;x0 ) &#65533; 
= &#8734; (&#8722;ik)n 
/an}bracketle{t(x &#8722;x0)n /an}bracketri}ht . (II.8) n! n=0 
&#8226; The cumulant g enerating function  is the logarithm of the characteristic function. Its 
e
xpansion generates the cumulants  of the distribution de&#64257;ned through 
&#8734; 
nln &#732;p(k) = &#65533; (&#8722;ik)n

&#65533; &#65533; of more than one event in dt is too small to consider, the process is equivalent to a binomial 
one. Using eq.(II.21), the characteristic function is given by 
&#65533; &#65533; n &#65533; &#65533; &#65533;&#65533; T/dt &#65533; &#65533;

The Poisson PDF is obtained from the inverse Fourier transform in eq.(II.6) as

(II.26) 
using the power series for the exponential. The integral over k is 
&#65533; &#8734; dk e ik(x&#8722;M) = &#948;(x &#8722;M), (II.27) 2&#960;&#8722;&#8734; 
leading to 
&#8734; &#65533; &#8722;&#945;T (&#945;T)M 
p&#945;T(x) = e &#948;(x &#8722;M). (II.28) M! m=0 
The probability of M events is thus p&#945;T(M) = e&#8722;&#945;T(&#945;T)M/M!. The cumulants of the 
distribution are obtained from the expansion 
&#8734; 
ln &#732;p&#945;T(k) = &#945;T(e &#8722;ik &#8722;1) = &#945;T &#65533; (&#8722;

All cumulants have the same value, and the moments are obtained from eqs.(II.12) as 
/an}bracketle{tM/an}bracketri}ht= (&#945;T), &#65533; 
M2&#65533; 
= (&#945;T)2 + (&#945;T), &#65533; 
M3&#65533; 
= (&#945;T)3 + 3(&#945;T)2 + (&#945;T). (II.30) 
Example: Assuming that stars are randomly distributed in the galaxy (clearly unjusti&#64257;ed) 
with a density n, what is the probability that the nearest star is at a distance R? 
Since, the probability of &#64257;nding a star in a small volume dV is ndV , and they are 
assumed to be independent, the number of stars in a volume V is described by a Poisson 
process as in eq.(II.28), with &#945; = n. The probability p(R), of encountering the &#64257;rst star 
at a distance R is the product of the probabilities pnV (0), of &#64257;nding zero stars in the 
volume V = 4&#960;R3/3 around the origin, and pndV (1), of &#64257;nding one star in the shell of 
volume dV = 4&#960;R2dR at a distance R. Both pnV (0) and pndV (1) can be calculated from 
eq.(II.28), and 
p(R)dR = pnV (0)pndV (1) =e &#8722;4&#960;R3n/3 e &#8722;4&#960;R2ndR 4&#960;R2ndR,

II.A General De&#64257;nitions 
The laws of thermodynamics are based on observations of macroscopic  bodies , and 
encapsulate their thermal properties. On the other hand, matter is composed of atoms 
and molecules whose motions are governed by fundamental laws of classical or quantum 
mechanics. It should be possible, in principle, to derive the behavior of a macroscopic 
body from the knowledge of its components. This is the problem addressed by kinetic theory in the following lectures. Actually, describing the full dynamics of the enormous number of particles involved is quite a daunting task. As we shall demonstrate, for dis&#173;cussing equilibrium properties of a macroscopic system, full knowledge of the behavior of its constituent particles is not necessary. All that is required is the likelihood  that the 
p
articles are in a particular microscopic state. Statistical mechanics is thus an inherently 
probabilities  description of the system. Familiarity with manipulations of probabilities is 
t
herefore an important prerequisite to statistical mechanics. Our purpose here is to review 
some important results in the theory of probability, and to introduce the notations that will be used in the rest of the course. 
The entity under investigation is a random  variable  x, 
which has a set of possible 
outcomes S&#8801; {x1, x2,&#183; &#183; &#183;}. The outcomes may be discrete  as in the case of a coin toss, 
Scoin = {head, tail}, or a dice throw, Sdice = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, or continuous  as for the 
v
elocity of a particle in a gas, S/vector v = {&#8722;&#8734; &lt; vx, vy, vz &lt; &#8734;}, or the energy of an electron 
in a metal at zero temperature, S&#491; = {0 &#8804;&#491; &#8804;&#491;F}. An event is any subset of outcomes 
E &#8834; S, and is assigned a probability p(E), e.g. pdice({1}) = 1/6, or pdice({1,3}) = 1/3. 
From an axiomatic point of view, the probabilities must satisfy the following conditions: 
(i) Positivity : p(E)&#8805;0, i.e. all probabilities must be non-zero. 
(ii) Additivity : p(A or B) = p(A) +p(B), ifA and B are disconnected events. 
(iii) Normalization: p(S) = 1, i.e. the random variable must have some outcome in S. 
From a practical point of view, we would like to know how to assign probability values 
to various outcomes. There are two possible approaches: 
(1) Objective  probabilities are obtained e xperimentally  from the relative frequency of the 
o
ccurrence of an outcome in many tests of the random variable. If the random process 
is repeated N times, and the event A occurs NA times, then 
NA p(A) = lim .

&#65533; &#65533; II.C Some Important Probability Distributions 
The properties of three commonly encountered probability distributions are examined 
in this section. 
(1) The normal (Gaussian) d istribution  describes a continuous real random variable x , 
with 
1 ( x &#8722;&#955;)2 
p(x) = exp . (II.15) &#8730;
2&#960;&#963;2 &#8722; 2&#963;2 
The corresponding characteristic function also has a Gaussian form, 
p&#732;(k) = &#65533; &#8734; 
dx 1 exp (x &#8722;&#955;)2 
&#8722;ikx = exp &#8722;ik&#955;&#8722; k2&#963;2 
. (II.16) 
&#8722;&#8734; &#8730;
2&#960;&#963;2 &#8722; 2&#963;2 2 
Cumulants of the distribution can be identi&#64257;ed from ln &#732; p(k) = &#8722;ik&#955; &#8722;k2&#963;2/2, using 
eq.(II.9), as 
/an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}htc = &#955; , &#65533; 
x 2&#65533; 
c = &#963;2 , &#65533; 
x 3&#65533; 
c = &#65533; 
x 4&#65533; 
c = = 0 . (II.17) &#183; &#183; &#183; 
The normal distribution is thus completely speci&#64257;ed by its two &#64257;rst cumulants. This makes 
the computation of moments using the cluster expansion (eqs.(II.12)) particularly simple, and 
/an}bracketle{tx/an}bracketri}ht= &#955; , 
x 
2= &#963;2 + &#955;2 , 
&#65533; &#65533; (II.18) 
x 3=3&#963;2&#955;+ &#955;3 , 
x 4=3&#963;4 + 6&#963;2&#955;2 +&#955;4 , .&#183; &#183; &#183; 
The normal distribution serves as the starting point for most perturbative computations in &#64257;eld theory. The vanishing of higher cumulants implies that all graphical computations involve only products of one point, and two point (known as propagators) clusters. 
(2) The binomial  distribution: Co
 nsider a random variable with two outcomes A and B 
(e.g. a coin toss) of relative probabilities pA and pB = 1&#8722;pA. The probability that in N 
trials the event A occurs exactly NA times (e.g. 5 heads in 12 coin tosses), is given by the 
binomial distribution 
N NA N&#8722;NApN(NA) = pA pB . (II.19) NA 
The prefactor, 
N N! 
NA = NA!(N &#8722;NA)! , (II.20)

(P &#8722;Pc)&#8733; (v &#8722;vc)&#948; , with &#948; &#8776; 5.0 . ( V.88) 
(c) The di&#64256;erence between liquid and gas densities vanishes close to the critical point as 
lim (&#961;liquid &#8722;&#961;gas)&#8733; lim (vgas &#8722;vliquid)&#8733; (Tc &#8722;T )&#946; , with &#946; &#8776; 0.3 . ( V.89)

These results clearly indicate that the assumption of analyticity of the isotherms, 
leading to eq.(V.83), is not correct. The exponents &#948;, &#947;, and &#946; a ppearing in eqs.(V.88)&#8211; 
(V.89) are known as critical indices . Understanding the origin, universality, and numerical 
values of these exponents is the a fascinating subject explored in the modern theory of 
critical phenomena.

Remarkably, the uniform density approximation reproduces the van der Waals equa&#173;
tion of state. However, the self-consistency of this approximation can now be checked. 
As long as &#954;T is positive, eq.(V.54) implies that the variance of density vanishes for large 
volumes as /angbracketleftbig 
n2/angbracketrightbig 
= kBTn2&#954;T/V . But &#954;T diverges at Tc, and at lower temperatures its c 
negativity implies an instability towards density &#64258;uctuations as discussed in the previous section. When condensation occurs, there is phase separation into high (liquid) and low (gas) density states, and the uniform density assumption becomes manifestly incorrect. 
This di&#64259;culty is circumvented in the grand canonical ensemble. Once the chemical poten&#173;
tial is &#64257;xed, the number of particles (and hence density) in this ensemble is automatically 
adjusted to that of the appropriate phase. 
As the assumption of a uniform density is correct for both the liquid and gas phases, 
we can use the approximations of eqs.(V.59) and (V.60) to estimate the grand partition function

V.H Critical Point Behavior 
To account for the universal behavior of gases close to their critical point, let us 
examine the isotherms in the vicinity of ( Pc,vc,Tc). For T &#8805; Tc, a Taylor expansion of 
P (T

Since &#8706;P/&#8706;v |T and &#8706;2P/&#8706;v2are both zero at Tc, the expansion of the derivatives around T

requires a &gt; 0 (for T &gt; T c) and c &gt; 0 (for T = Tc), but provides no information on the 
sign of b. If an analytical expansion is possible, the isotherms of any gas in the vicinity of 
its critical point must have the general form, 
P (T,v) = Pc+&#945;(T &#8722;Tc)&#8722;a(T &#8722;Tc)(v&#8722;vC)+ b (T &#8722;Tc)(v&#8722;vc)2&#8722; c (v&#8722;vc)3+&#183; &#183; &#183; . ( V.83) 2 6

Note that the third and &#64257;fth terms are of comparable magnitude for ( T &#8722;Tc)&#8764; (v &#8722;vc)2 . 
The fourth (and higher order terms) can then be neglected when this condition is satis&#64257;ed. 
&#8226; The analytic expansion of eq.(V.83) results in the following predictions for behavior
close to the critical point:
(a) The gas compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point from the high tem&#173;
perature side, along the critical isochore ( v = v

(b) The critical isotherm ( T = Tc) behaves as 
c P = Pc &#8722; (v &#8722;vc)3 +&#183; &#183; &#183; . ( V.85) 6
(c) Eq.(V.83) is manifestly inapplicable to T &lt; T c. However, we can try to extract infor&#173;
mation for the low temperature side by applying the Maxwell construction to the unstable 
c isotherms. Actually, dimensional considerations are su&#64259;cient to show that on approaching 
Tc from the low temperature side, the speci&#64257;c volumes of the coexisting liquid and gas 
phases approach each other as 
lim (vgas &#8722;vliquid)&#8733; (Tc &#8722;T )1/2 . (V.86) 
T&#8594;T&#8722; 
c The liquid&#8211;gas transition for T &lt; T c is accompanied by a discontinuity in density, 
and the release of latent heat L. This kind of transition is usually referred to as &#64257;rst 
order or discontinuous. The di&#64256;erence between the two phases disappears as the line of 
&#64257;rst order transitions terminates at the critical point. The singular behavior at this point 
is attributed to a second order or continuous transition. Eq.(V.83) follows from no more 
than the constraints of mechanical stability, and the assumption of analytical isotherms. 
Although there are some unknown coe&#64259;cients, eqs.(V.85)&#8211;(V.86) predict universal forms 
for the singularities close to the critical point and can be compared to experimental data. The experimental results do indeed con&#64257;rm the general expectations of singular behavior, 
and there is universality in the results for di&#64256;erent gases which can be summarized as 
(a) The compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point as 
lim &#954;(T,v

In principle, all properties of the interacting system, including phase separation, 
are contained within the thermodynamic potentials that can be obtained by evaluating 
Z(T,N) or Q(T,&#181;). Phase transitions, however, are characterized by discontinuities in 
various state functions and must correspond to the appearance of singularities in the par&#173;tition functions. At &#64257;rst glance, it is somewhat surprising that any singular behavior should emerge from computing such well behaved integrals (for short-ranged interactions) as &#63726; &#63737; /integraldisplay/producttext

/parenleftBig /parenrightBig i.e., equilibrium is characterized by a function &#920; of thermodynamic coordinates. This 
function speci&#64257;es the equation  of state, and i sotherms of A are described by the condition 
&#920;A(A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183;) = &#920;. 
Example: Consider three systems: (A) a wire of length L with tension F, (B) a param&#173;
agnet of magnetization M in a magnetic &#64257;eld B, and (C) a gas of volume V at pressure P. 
Observations indicate that when these systems are in equilibrium, the following constraints 
are satis&#64257;ed between their coordinates: 
a P + ( V &#8722;b)(L&#8722;L0)&#8722;c[F &#8722;K(L&#8722;L0)] = 0 ,V2 /parenleftBig a /parenrightBig (I.7) 
P + ( V &#8722;b)M &#8722;dB = 0. V2 
Clearly these constraints can be organized into three empirical temperature functions as 
/parenleftBig a /parenrightBig F B &#920; &#8733; P + ( V &#8722;b) = c &#8722;K = d . (I.8) V2 L&#8722;L0 M

The ideal  gas temperature scale:  As the above example indicates, the zeroth law 
mere
ly states the presence of isotherms. In order to set up a practical temperature scale 
at this stage, a reference system is necessary. The ideal gas occupies an important place 
in 
thermodynamics and provides the necessary reference. Empirical observations indicate 
that the product of pressure and volume is constant along the isotherms of any gas that is 
su&#64259;ciently dilute. The ideal gas refers to this dilute  limit of real gases, and the ideal gas 
te
mperature is proportional to the product. The constant of proportionality is determined 
by reference to the temperature of the triple point of the ice&#8211;water&#8211;gas system, which was set to 273.16 degrees Kelvin (
0K) by the 10th General Conference on Weights and 
Measures in 1954. Using a dilute gas (i.e. as P &#8594; 0) as thermometer, the temperature of 
a system can be obtained from 
T(oK)&#8801; 273.16&#215; lim (PV)system/ lim (PV)ice&#8722;water&#8722; gas . (I.10)

          <text>I.B The zeroth law 
The zeroth law of thermodynamics describes the transitive nature of thermal equilib&#173;
rium. It states: 
&#8226; If two systems, A and B, are separately in equilibrium with a third system C, then they 
are also in equilibrium with one another. 
Despite its apparent simplicity, the zeroth law has the consequence of implying the 
existence of an important state function, the empirical temperature  &#920;, such that systems 
in 
equilibrium are at the same temperature. 
Proof: Let the equilibrium state of systems A, B, and C be described by the coordinates 
{A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183;}, {B1, B2,&#183; &#183; &#183;}, and {C1, C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;} respectively. The assumption that A and C 
are in equilibrium implies a constraint between the coordinates of A and C, i.e. a change in A
1 must be accompanied by some changes in {A2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C1, C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;} to maintain equilibrium 
of A and C. Denote this constraint by 
fAC(A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C1, C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;) = 0. (I.1) 
The equilibrium of B and C implies a similar constraint 
fBC(B1, B2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C1, C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;) = 0. (I.2) 
Each of the above equations can be solved for C1 to yield 
C1 =FAC(A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;), 
(I.3) 
C1 =FBC(B1, B2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;). 
Thus if C is separately in equilibrium with A and B we must have 
FAC(A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;) = FBC(B1, B2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;C2,&#183; &#183; &#183;). (I.4) 
However, according to the zeroth law there is also equilibrium between A and B, implying the constraint 
f
AB(A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ;B1, B2,&#183; &#183; &#183;) = 0. (I.5) 
Therefore it must be possible to simplify eq.(I.4) by cancelling the coordinates of C. Hence, the condition (I.5) for equilibrium of A and B must be expressible as 
&#920;
A(A1, A2,&#183; &#183; &#183;) = &#920; B(B1, B2,&#183; &#183; &#183;), (I.6)

          <text>I. Thermodynamics
I.A Fundamental de&#64257;nitions 
&#8226; Thermodynamics is aphenomenological  description of eq uilibrium  properties of ma cro&#173;
scopic systems . 
&#8902; As 
a phenomenological  description, it is based on a number of empirical observations 
whi
ch are summarized by the laws of thermodynamics. A coherent logical and mathe&#173;
matical structure is then constructed on the basis of these observations, which leads to 
a variety of useful concepts, and to testable relationships among various quantities. The laws of thermodynamics can only be justi&#64257;ed by a more fundamental (microscopic) theory of nature. For example, statistical mechanics attempts to obtain these laws starting from classical or quantum mechanical equations for the evolution of collections of particles. 
&#8902; A system under study is said to be in equilibrium  when its properties do not change 
ap
preciably with time over the intervals of interest (observation times). The dependence 
on the observation time makes the concept of equilibrium subjective. For example, window 
glass is in equilibrium as a solid over many decades, but &#64258;ows like a &#64258;uid over time scales of millennia. At the other extreme, it is perfectly legitimate to consider the equilibrium between matter and radiation in the early universe during the &#64257;rst minutes of the big bang. 
&#8902; The macroscopic  system in equilibrium is characterized by a number of th
 ermodynamic 
coo
rdinates or state f unctions . S ome common examples of such coordinates are pressure 
and volume (for a &#64258;uid), surface tension and area (for a &#64257;lm), tension and length (for 
a wire), electric &#64257;eld and polarization (for a dielectric), &#183; &#183; &#183;. A closed  system is an ide&#173;
al
ization similar to a point particle in mechanics in that it is assumed to be completely 
isolated by adiabatic walls  that don&#8217;t allow any exchange of heat with the surroundings. 
By 
contrast, diathermic  walls  allow heat exchange for an op en system. In addition to the 
ab
ove mechanical coordinates, the laws of thermodynamics imply the existence of other 
equilibrium state functions as described in the following sections.

          <text>/summationtext I.C The First law 
We now consider transformations between di&#64256;erent equilibrium states. Such transfor&#173;
mations can be achieved by applying work or heat to the system. The &#64257;rst law states that 
bo
th work and heat are forms of energy , and that the total energy is conserved. We shall 
use the following formulation: 
&#8226; The amount of work required to change the state of an otherwise adiabatically isolated 
system depends only on the initial and &#64257;nal states, and not on the means by which the work is performed, or on the intermediate stages through which the system passes. 
As a consequence, we conclude the existence of another state function, the internal 
energy, E(X). Up to a constant, E(X) can be obtained from the amount of work &#916; W 
needed for an adiabatic  transformation from an initial state X
i to a &#64257;nal state Xf , using 
&#916;W = E(Xf )&#8722;E(Xi). (I.11) 
In a generic ( non&#8211;adiabatic ) transformation, the amount of work does not equal to the 
change in the internal energy. The di&#64256;erence &#916; Q = &#916;E &#8722; &#916;W is de&#64257;ned as the heat 
intake of the system from its surroundings. Clearly in such transformations, &#916; Q and 
&#916;W are not separately functions of state, in that they depend on external factors such 
as the means of applying work, and not only on the &#64257;nal states. To emphasize this, for a di&#64256;erential transformation we write 
&#175;= &#175; (I.12) dQ dE &#8722;dW, 
where dE = dQ and &#175; &#8706;
iEdX i can be obtained by di&#64256;erentiation, while &#175; dW generally i 
can not. Also note the convention that the signs of work and heat are chosen to indicate the energy added to the system, and not vice versa. 
A qu 
asi-static  transformation is one that is performed su&#64259;ciently slowly so that the 
sy
stem is always in equilibrium. Thus at any stage of the process, the thermodynamic 
coordinates of the system exist and can in principle be computed. For such transformations, the work done on the system (equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done by the system) can be related to changes in these coordinates. Typically one can divide the state functions {X} into a set of generalized  displacements  {x}, and their conjugate 
ge
neralized  forces  {J}, such that for an in&#64257;nitesimal quasi-static transformation 
/summationdisplay 
&#175;dW = Jidxi. (I.13)

Joule&#8217;s Free Expansion Experiment:  Another important property of the ideal gas 
is 
the behavior of its internal energy. Observations indicate that if such a gas expands 
adiabatically (but not necessarily quasi-statically), from a volume Vi to Vf, the initial and 
&#64257;nal temperatures are the same. Since the transformation is adiabatic (&#916; Q = 0) and 
there is no external work done on the system (&#916; W = 0), the internal energy of the gas 
is unchanged. Since the pressure and volume of the gas change in the process, but its temperature does not, we conclude that the internal energy depends only on temperature, i.e. E(V, T) = E(T). This property of the ideal gas is in fact a consequence of the form of 
its equation of state as will be proved in test 1 review problems. 
Response  functions are 
 the usual method for characterizing the macroscopic behav&#173;
ior of a system. They are experimentally measured from the changes of thermodynamic coordinates with external probes. Some common response functions are: Heat Capacities are obtained from the change in temperature upon addition of heat to the system. Since heat is not a function of state, the path by which it is supplied must also be speci&#64257;ed. For example, for a gas we can calculate the heat capacities at constant volume or pressure, denoted by C
V = dQ/dT |V and CP = dQ/dT |P respectively. The latter is &#175; &#175;
larger since some of the heat is used up in the work done in changes of volume:

          <text>Force Constants measure the (in&#64257;nitesimal) ratio of displacement to force and are gener&#173;
alizations of the spring constant. Examples include the isothermal compressibility of a gas &#954;
T = &#8722; &#8706;V/&#8706;P |T /V, and the susceptibility of a magnet &#967;T = &#8706;M/&#8706;B |T /V. From the 
equation of state of an ideal gas PV &#8733; T, we obtain &#954;T = 1/P. 
Thermal Responses probe the change in the thermodynamic coordinates with temperature. 
For example, the expansivity of a gas is given by &#945;P = &#8706;V/&#8706;T |P /V, which equals 1 /T 
for the ideal gas. 
Since the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, &#8706;E/&#8706;T |V = 
&#8706;E/&#8706;T |P = dE/dT , and eq.(I.14) simpli&#64257;es to

The last equality follows from extensivity: for a given amount of ideal gas, the constant 
PV/T is proportional to N, the number of particles in the gas; the ratio is Boltzmann&#8217;s 
constant with a value of kB &#8776; 1.4&#215; 10&#8722;23J0K&#8722;1 .

          <text>VII.G Super&#64258;uid He4 
Interesting examples of quantum &#64258;uids are provided by the isotopes of helium. The 
two electrons of He occupy the 1s orbital with opposite spins. The &#64257;lled orbital makes 
this noble gas particularly inert. There is still a van der Waals attraction between two He atoms, but the interatomic potential has a shallow minimum of depth 9
&#9702;K at a separation 
of roughly 3 &#730; As the A. The weakness of this interaction makes He a powerful wetting agent. 
He atoms have a stronger attraction for practically all other molecules, they easily spread over the surface of any substance. Due to its light mass, the He atom undergoes large zero 
point &#64258;uctuations at T = 
0. These &#64258;uctuations are su&#64259;cient to melt a solid phase, and 
thus He remains in a liquid state at ordinary pressures. Pressures of over 25 atmosphere 
are required to su&#64259;ciently localize the He atoms to result in a solid phase at T = 0. A 
remarkable property of the quantum liquid at zero temperature is that, unlike its classical counterpart, it has zero entropy. 
The lighter isotope of He
3 has three nucleons and obeys fermi statistics. The liquid 
phase is very well described by a fermi gas of the type discussed in sec.VII.E. The inter&#173;actions between atoms do not signi&#64257;cantly change the non-interacting picture described earlier. By contrast, the heavier isotope of He
4 is a boson. Helium can be cooled down by 
a process of evaporation: Liquid helium is placed in an isolated container, in equilibrium with the gas phase at a &#64257;nite vapor density. As the helium gas is pumped out, part of the liquid evaporates to take its place. The evaporation process is accompanied by the release of latent heat which cools the liquid. The boiling liquid is quite active and turbulent, just as a boiling pot of water. However, when the liquid is cooled down to below 2 .2
&#9702;K, it 
suddenly becomes quiescent and the turbulence disappears. The liquids on the two sides of this phase transition are usually referred to as HeI and HeII. 
HeII has unusual hydrodynamic properties. It &#64258;ows through the &#64257;nest capillaries 
without any resistance. Consider an experiment that pushes HeII from one container to another through a small tube packed with powder. For ordinary &#64258;uids a &#64257;nite pressure di&#64256;erence between the containers, proportional to viscosity, is necessary to maintain the &#64258;ow. HeII &#64258;ows even in the limit of zero pressure di&#64256;erence and acts as if it has zero viscosity. For this reason it is referred to as a super&#64258;uid. The super&#64258;ow is accompanied 
by heating of the container that loses HeII and cooling of the container that accepts it; the mechano&#8211;caloric e&#64256;ect. Conversely, HeII acts to remove temperature di&#64256;erences 
by &#64258;owing away from hot regions. This is the basis of the fountain e&#64256;ect in which the 
super&#64258;uid spontaneously moves up a tube from a heated container.

          <text>In some other circumstances HeII behaves as a viscous &#64258;uid. A classical method 
for measuring the viscosity of a liquid is via torsional oscillators: A collection of closely 
spaced disks connected to a shaft is immersed in the &#64258;uid and made to oscillate. The 
period of oscillations is proportional to the moment of inertia, which is modi&#64257;ed by the 
quantity of &#64258;uid that is dragged by the oscillator. This experiment was performed on HeII by Andronikashvilli who indeed found a &#64257;nite viscous drag. Furthermore, the changes in the frequency of the oscillator with temperature indicate that the quantity of &#64258;uid that 
is dragged by the oscillator starts to decrease below the transition temperature. The 
measured normal density vanishes as T 0
, approximately as T 4 . &#8594;
In 1938, Fritz London suggested that a good starting hypothesis is that the transition 
to the super&#64258;uid state is related to the Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation. This hypothesis can account for a number of observations: (1) The critical temperature of an ideal bose gas of volume v = 
A per particle is 46.2&#730;
obtained from eq.(VII.55) as 
Tc = h2 /parenleftbig 
v&#950;3/2 /parenrightbig&#8722;2/3 &#8776;3.14&#9702;K. (VII.68) 2&#960;mHekB 
The actual transition temperature of Tc &#8776;2.18&#9702;K is not far from this value. 
(2) The origin of the transition has to be related to quantum statistics as He3, which is 
atomically similar, but a fermion, does not have a similar transition. (Actually He3 does 
become super&#64258;uid but at temperatures of only a few m&#9702;K. This follows a pairing of He3 
atoms which changes their statistics.) (3) A bose condensate can account for the observed thermo&#8211;mechanical properties of 
HeII. The expression for pressure in eq.(VII.56) is only a function of temperature, and not density. As such, variations in pressure are accompanied by changes in temperature. This is also the reason for the absence of boiling activity in HeII. Bubbles nucleate and grow in a boiling liquid at local hot spots. In an ordinary &#64258;uid, variations in temperature relax 
to equilibrium only through the slow process of heat di&#64256;usion. By contrast if the local 
pressure is a function of temperature only, there will be increased pressure at a hot spot. 
The &#64258;uid &#64258;ows in response to pressure gradients and removes them very rapidly (at the 
speed of sound in the medium). 
(4) Hydrodynamic behavior of HeII can be explained by Tisza&#8217;s two&#8211;&#64258;uid model , which 
postulates the coexistence of two components for T &lt;
T C: 
(a) A normal component of density &#961;n, moving with velocity /vector vn, and having a &#64257;nite 
entropy density sn.

        <slide>
          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>(b) A super&#64258;uid component of density &#961;s, which &#64258;ows without viscosity and with no 
vorticity ( &#8711; &#215;/vector us = 0), and has zero entropy density, ss = 0. 
In the super-leak experiments, it is the super&#64258;uid component that passes through, reduc&#173;
ing the entropy and hence temperature. In the Andronikashilli experiment, the normal 
component sticks to the torsional oscillator and gets dragged by it. This experiment thus gives the ratio of &#961;
n to &#961;s. 
There are, however, many important di&#64256;erences between super&#64258;uid helium and the 
ideal bose condensate: (1) Interactions certainly play an important role in the liquid state. The Bose&#8211;Einstein 
condensate has in&#64257;nite compressibility, while HeII has a &#64257;nite density, related to atomic volume, and is essentially incompressible. 
(2)It can be shown that, even at T =
0, the ideal bose condensate is not super&#64258;uid. This 
is because the low energy spectrum, E(/vectork) = h&#175;2k2/2m, admits too many excitations. Any 
external body moving through such a &#64258;uid can easily lose energy to it by exciting these 
modes, leading to a &#64257;nite viscosity. (3) The detailed functional forms of the heat capacity and super&#64258;uid density are very 
di&#64256;erent from their counterparts in the ideal bose condensate. The measured heat capacity diverges at the transition with a characteristic shape similar to a &#955;, and vanishes at low 
temperatures as T 
3 (compared to T 3/2 for the ideal bose gas). The super&#64258;uid density 
obtained in the Andronikashvilli experiment vanishes as ( Tc &#8722;T )2/3 at the transition, while 
the normal component vanishes as approximately T 4 as T 0 (compared to T 3/2 for the &#8594;
condensate density in eq.(VII.53)). Understanding the nature of the singular behavior close to T
c is beyond the scope of this discussion. The behavior close to zero temperature, 
however, suggests a di&#64256;erent spectrum of low energy excitations. 
Based on the shape of the experimentally measured heat capacity, Landau suggested 
that the spectrum of low energy excitations is actually similar to that of phonons. This 
is a consequence of the interactions between the particles. The low energy excitations of 
a classical liquid are longitudinal sound waves. (In comparison, a solid admits three such excitations, two transverse and one longitudinal.) The correspondence principle suggests that quantized versions of such modes should also be present in a quantum liquid. As in the case of phonons, a linear spectrum of excitations leads to a heat capacity that 
vanishes as T 
3 . The speed of sound waves can be computed from the coe&#64259;cient of the 
T 3 dependence as v &#8776;2 40ms&#8722;1 . A further anomaly in heat capacity can be explained by 
assuming that the spectrum of excitations bends down and has a minimum in the vicinity

to as rotons , and have an energy

with &#916; &#8776;8.6&#9702;K, and &#181; &#8776;0.1 6mHe. The spectrum postulated by Landau was con&#64257;rmed 
directly by neutron scattering measurements in the 1950&#8217;s.

where we have identi&#64257;ed the heat capacity with the thermal derivative of the average 
energy &#8733;an}bracketle{tH&#8733;an}bracketri}ht. Eq.(IV.68) shows that it is justi&#64257;ed to treat the mean and most likely energies 
interchangeably, since the width of the distribution p(E), only grows as 2 N1/2 . &#65533; &#8733;an}bracketle{tH &#8733;an}bracketri}ht c &#8733;

N. (In fact 
eq.(IV.67) shows that all cumulants of Hare proportional to N.) The PDF for energy in 
a canonical ensemble can thus be approximated by 
1 1 p(E) = e &#8722;&#946;F(E) &#8776;exp (E &#8722; &#8733;an}bracketle{tH&#8733;an}bracketri}ht )2

2&#960;kBT2Cx 
The above distribution is su&#64259;ciently sharp to make the internal energy in a canonical 
ensemble unambiguous in the N &#8594; &#8734; limit. Some care is necessary if the heat capacity 
Cx is divergent, as is the case in some continuous phase transitions. 
The canonical probabilities in eq.(IV.56) are unbiased estimates obtained (as in 
sec.(II.G)) by constraining the average energy . The entropy of the canonical ensemble 
can also be calculated directly from eq.(IV.56) (using eq.(III.68)) as 
S = &#8722;kB &#8733;an}bracketle{tlnp(&#181;)&#8733;an}bracketri}ht= &#8722;kB &#8733;an}bracketle{t(&#8722;&#946;H &#8722;lnZ)&#8733;an}bracketri}ht= E &#8722;F, (IV.70) T 
again using the identi&#64257;cation of ln Z with the free energy from eq.(IV.63). For any &#64257;nite 
system, the canonical and microcanonical probabilities are distinct. However, in the so 
called thermodynamic limit of N &#8594; &#8734; limit, the canonical probabilities are so sharply 
peaked around the average energy that they are essentially indistinct from microcanonical probabilities at that energy. The following table compares the prescriptions used in the two ensembles.

IV.E Mixing Entropy and Gibbs&#8217; Paradox 
The expression in eq.(IV.33) for the entropy of the ideal gas has a major shortcoming in 
that it is not extensive . Under the transformation (E, V, N ) (&#955;E, &#955;V, &#955;N ), the entropy &#8594;
changes to &#955;(S+NkB ln&#955;). The additional term comes from the contribution VN, of the 
coordinates to the available phase space. This di&#64259;culty is intimately related to the mixing 
entropy of two gases. Consider two distinct gases, initially occupying volumes V1 and V2 
at the same temperature T. The partition between them is removed, and they are allowed 
to expand and occupy the combined volume V = V1 + V2. The mixing process is clearly 
irreversible, and must be accompanied by an increase in entropy, calculated as follows. According to eq.(IV.33), the initial entropy is 
S
i = S1 + S2 = N1kB(lnV1 + &#963;1) +N2kB(lnV2 + &#963;2), (IV.40) 
where, &#65533; &#65533;3/24&#960;em &#945; E&#945;&#963;&#945; = ln , (IV.41) 3 &#183; N&#945; 
is the momentum contribution to the entropy of the &#945;th gas. Since E&#945;/N&#945; = 3kBT/2 for 
a monotonic gas, 
3 &#963;&#945;(T) = ln(2 &#960;em &#945;kBT). (IV.42) 2 
The temperature of the gas is unchanged by mixing, since

&#65533; &#65533; 
&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; As the argument of the logarithm has changed from V to V/N, the &#64257;nal expression is now 
properly extensive. The mixing entropies can be recalculated using eq.(IV.47). For the 
mixing of distinct gases, 
V V V1 V2&#916;SMix = Sf &#8722;Si = N1kB ln N1 +N2kB ln N2 &#8722;N1kB ln N1 &#8722;N2kB ln N2 
V N 1 V N 2 = N1kB ln + N2kB ln (IV.48) N1 &#183; V1 N2 &#183; V2 
N1 V1 N2 V2 = &#8722;NkB ln + ln ,N V N V 
exactly as obtained before in eq.(IV.45). For the &#8216;mixing&#8217; of two identical gases, with 
N1/V1 = N2/V2 = (N1 + N2)/(V1 +V2), 
V1 + V2 V1 V2&#916;SMix = Sf &#8722;Si = (N1 +N2)kB ln N1 + N2 &#8722;N1kB ln N1 &#8722;N2kB ln = 0 . (IV.49) N2 
Note that after taking the permutations of identical particles into account, the available 
volume in the &#64257;nal state is VN1+N2 /N1!N2! for distinct particles, and VN1+N2 /(N1 +N2)! 
for identical particles. &#8226; Additional comments on the microcanonical entropy: 
1. In the example of two-level impurities in a solid matrix (sec.IV.C), there is no need for 
the additional factor of N!, as the defects can be distinguished by their locations. 
2. The corrected formula for the ideal gas entropy in eq.(IV.47) does not a&#64256;ect the com&#173;
putations of energy and pressure in eqs.(IV.34) and (IV.35). It is essential to obtaining an intensive chemical potential,

T = &#8722;&#8706;N E,V = &#8722;N +2 kB = kB ln N 3N. (IV.50) 
3. The above treatment of identical particles is somewhat arti&#64257;cial. This is because 
the concept of identical particles does not easily &#64257;t within the framework of classical 
mechanics. To implement the Hamiltonian equations of motion on a computer, one has to keep track of the coordinates of the N particles. The computer will have no di&#64259;culty in 
distinguishing exchanged particles. The indistinguishability of their phase spaces is in a sense an additional postulate of classical statistical mechanics. This problem is elegantly resolved within the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Description of identical particles in quantum mechanics requires proper symmetrization of the wave function.

representation of n!. Equating expressions (IV.28) and (IV.30) for Id gives the &#64257;nal result 
for the solid angle,

Sd = . (IV.31) (d/2&#8722;1)! 
The volume of the available phase space is thus given by 
2&#960;3N/2 
&#937;(E, V, N ) = VN (2mE)(3N&#8722;1)/2&#916;R. (IV.32) (3N/2&#8722;1)!
The entropy is obtained from the logarithm of the above expression. Using Stirling&#8217;s 
formula, and neglecting terms of order of 1 or ln E &#8764;lnN in the large N limit, results in

The internal energy E = 3NkBT/2, is only a function of T, and the heat capacity CV = 
3NkB/2, is a constant. The equation of state is obtained from

The unconditional probability of &#64257;nding a particle of momentum p /vector1 in the gas can be 
calculated from the joint PDF in eq.(IV.27), by integrating over all other variables,

&#65533; &#65533; The average energy computed from the distribution in eq.(IV.59) is

&#181; &#181; 
In thermodynamics, a similar expression was encountered for the energy (eq.(I.37)), 
E = F + TS = F &#8722;T &#8706;F &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; 
= &#8722;T2 &#8706; F = &#8706;(&#946;F) . (IV.62) &#8706;T &#8706;T T &#8706;&#946; x 
Eqs.(IV.60) and (IV.61), both suggest identifying 
F(T,x) = &#8722;kBT lnZ(T,x). (IV.63) 
However, note that eq.(IV.60) refers to the most likely energy, while the average energy 
appears in eq.(IV.61). How close are these two values of the energy? We can get an idea of the width of the probability distribution p(E), by computing the variance &#8733;an}bracketle{tH 
2 &#8733;an}bracketri}htc. This is 
most easily accomplished by noting that Z(&#946;) is proportional to the characteristic function 
for H(with &#946; replacing ik) and, 
&#8706;Z = &#8722;&#946;H, and &#8706;2Z = 2 e &#8722;&#946;H. (IV.64) &#8722;&#8706;&#946; He &#8706;&#946;2 H

&#65533; &#65533; The &#64257;nal entropy of the mixed gas is 
Sf = N1kB ln(V1 + V2) +N2kB ln(V1 +V2) +kB(N1&#963;1 + N2&#963;2). (IV.44) 
There is no change in the contribution from the momenta which depends only on temper&#173;
ature. The mixing entropy, 
V V N1 V1 N2 V2&#916;SMix = Sf &#8722;Si = N1kB ln + N2kB ln = &#8722;NkB ln + ln , (IV.45) V1 V2 N V N V 
is solely from the contribution of the coordinates. The above expression is easily generalized 
to the mixing of many components, with &#916; SMix = &#8722;NkB &#945;(N&#945;/N) ln(V&#945;/V). 
Gibbs&#8217; Paradox is related to what happens when the two gases, initially on the two 
sides of the partition, are identical with the same density, n = N1/V1 = N2/V2. Since 
removing or inserting the partition does not change the state of the system, there should be no entropy of mixing, while eq.(IV.45) does predict such a change. For the resolution of this paradox, note that while after removing and reinserting the partition, the system does 
return to its initial con&#64257;guration, the actual particles that occupy the two components 
are not the same. But as the particles are by assumption identical , these con&#64257;gurations 
cannot be distinguished. In other words, while the exchange of distinct particles leads to 
two con&#64257;gurations 
&#8226; | &#9702; and &#9702; | &#8226; ,
A B A B| | 
a similar exchange has no e&#64256;ect on identical particles, as in 
&#8226; | &#8226; and &#8226; | &#8226; . A B A B| | 
Therefore, we have over-counted the phase space associated with N identical parti&#173;
cles by the number of possible permutations. As there are N! permutations leading to 
indistinguishable micro-states, eq.(IV.32) should be corrected to 
&#937;(N, E, V ) = VN 2&#960;3N/2 
(2mE)(3N&#8722;1)/2&#916;R, (IV.46) N! (3N/2&#8722;1)!
resulting in a modi&#64257;ed entropy, 
eV S = kB ln &#937; = kB[N lnV &#8722;N lnN + N lne] +NkB&#963; = NkB ln + &#963; . (IV.47) N

&#65533; 
&#65533; corresponding quantum microstates naturally yield the N! factor, as will be shown later 
on. 
4. Yet another di&#64259;culty with the expression (IV.47), resolved in quantum statistical me&#173;
chanics, is the arbitrary constant that appears in changing the units of measurement for 
q and p. The volume of phase space involves products pq, of coordinates and conjugate 
momenta, and hence has dimensions of (action)N . Quantum mechanics provides the ap&#173;
propriate measure of action in Planck&#8217;s constant h. Anticipating these quantum results, 
we shall henceforth set the measure of phase space for identical particles to 
N 
d&#915;N =1 d3/vector qid3p /vectori . (IV.51) h3NN! i=1 
IV.F The Canonical Ensemble 
In the microcanonical ensemble, the energy E, of a large macroscopic system is pre&#173;
cisely speci&#64257;ed, and its equilibrium temperature T, emerges as a consequence (eq.(IV.7)). 
However, from a thermodynamic perspective, E and T are both functions of state and on 
the same footing. It is possible to construct a statistical mechanical formulation in which the temperature of the system is speci&#64257;ed and its internal energy is then deduced. This is achieved in the canonical ensemble where the macro-states, speci&#64257;ed by M &#8801;(T,x), allow 
the input of heat into the system, but no external work. The system S, is maintained at a constant temperature through contact with a reservoir R. The reservoir is another 
macroscopic system that is su&#64259;ciently large so that its temperature is not changed due to interactions with S. To &#64257;nd the probabilities p
(T,x)(&#181;), of the various micro-states of 
S, note that the combined system R&#8853;S, belongs to a microcanonical ensemble of energy 
ETot &#8811;ES. As in eq.(IV.3), the joint probability of micro-states ( &#181;S &#8855;&#181;R) is 
1 1 for HS(&#181;S) +HR(&#181;R) = ETot 
p(&#181;S &#8855;&#181;R) = . (IV.52) &#937;S&#8853;R(ETot)&#183; 
0 otherwise 
The unconditional probability for micro-states of S is now obtained from
p(&#181;S) = p(&#181;S &#8855;&#181;R). (IV.53) 
{&#181;R }

&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; 
&#65533; &#65533; Once &#181;S is speci&#64257;ed, the above sum is restricted to micro-states of the reservoir with energy 
ETot &#8722; HS(&#181;S). The number of the such states is related to the entropy of the reservoir, 
and leads to 
p(&#181;S) =&#937;R ETot &#8722; HS(&#181;S) &#8733;exp 1 SR &#65533; 
ETot &#8722; HS(&#181;S) &#65533;

Since by assumption the energy of the system is insigni&#64257;cant compared to that of the 
reservoir, 
SR &#65533; 
ETot &#8722; HS(&#181;S) &#65533; 
&#8776;SR(ETot)&#8722; HS(&#181;S) &#8706;SR = SR(ETot)&#8722;HS(&#181;S) . (IV.55) &#8706;ER T 
Dropping the subscript S, the normalized probabilities are given by 
e&#8722;&#946;H(&#181;) 
p(T,x)(&#181;) = . (IV.56) Z(T,x) 
The normalization, 
Z(T,x) = e &#8722;&#946;H(&#181;), (IV.57) 
{&#181;} 
is known as the partition function , and &#946; &#8801;1/kBT. (Note that probabilities similar to 
eq.(IV.56) were already obtained in eqs.(IV.25), and (IV.39), when considering a portion 
of the system in equilibrium with the rest of it.) 
Is the internal energy E, of the system S well de&#64257;ned? Unlike in a microcanonical 
ensemble, the energy of a system exchanging heat with a reservoir is a random variable. 
Its probability distribution p(E), is obtained by changing variables from &#181;to H(&#181;) inp(&#181;), 
resulting in 
&#65533; e&#8722;&#946;E&#65533; 
p(E) = p(&#181;)&#948;(H(&#181;)&#8722; E) = Z&#948;(H(&#181;)&#8722; E). (IV.58) 
{&#181;} {&#181;} 
Since the restricted sum is just the number &#937;( E), of micro-states of appropriate energy, 
p(E)&#937;(E)e&#8722;&#946;E 1 S(E) &#8722;E 1 F(E) = = exp = exp , (IV.59) Z Z k B kBT Z &#8722;kBT 
where we have set F = E &#8722;TS(E), in anticipation of its relation to the Helmholtz free 
energy . The probability p(E), is sharply peaked at a most probable energy E&#8727;, which 
minimizes F(E). Using the result in sec.(II.F) for sums over exponentials, 
Z = e &#8722;&#946;H(&#181;) = e &#8722;&#946;F(E) &#8776;e &#8722;&#946;F(E &#8727; ). (IV.60)

&#65533; IV.D The Ideal Gas 
As discussed in chapter II, micro-states of a gas of N particles correspond to points &#181;&#8801; 
{p /vectori,/vector qi}, in the 6 N-dimensional phase space. Ignoring the potential energy of interactions, 
the particles are subject to a Hamiltonian 
N &#65533;&#65533; &#65533; p /vectori 2 
H=2m +U(q /vectori) , (IV.26) 
i=1 
where U(/vector q) describes the potential imposed by a box of volume V. A microcanonical 
ensemble is speci&#64257;ed by its energy, volume, and number of particles, M &#8801;(E, V, N ). The 
joint PDF for a micro-state is 
1 for q /vectori &#8712;box, and &#65533; p /vectori 2/2m = E (&#177;&#916;E)1 i p(&#181;) = . (IV.27) &#937;(E, V, N )&#183; 
0 otherwise 
In the allowed micro-states, coordinates of the particles must be within the box, while 
the momenta are constrained to the surface of the (hyper-)sphere &#65533;N
i=1 p /vectori 2 = 2mE. The 
allowed phase space is thus the product of a contribution VN from the coordinates, with 
the surface area of a 3 N-dimensional sphere of radius &#8730;
2mE from the momenta. (If the 
microstate energies are accepted in the energy interval E&#177;&#916;E, the corresponding volume 
in momentum space is that of a (hyper-)spherical shell of thickness &#916; R = 2 m/E&#916;E.) 
The area of a d-dimensional sphere is Ad = SdRd&#8722;1, where Sd is the generalized solid 
angle. 
A simple way to calculate the d&#8211;dimensional solid angle is to consider the product of 
d Gaussian integrals, &#65533;&#65533; &#8734; &#65533;d 
Id &#8801; dxe&#8722;x 2 = &#960;d/2 . (IV.28) 
&#8722;&#8734; 
Alternatively, we may consider Id as an integral over an entire d&#8211;dimensional space, i.e. 
&#65533; d 
Id = dxi exp &#65533; 
&#8722;xi 2&#65533; 
. (IV.29) 
i=1 
The integrand is spherically symmetric, and we can change coordinates to R2 = &#65533; 
i x2 
i. 
Noting that the corresponding volume element in these coordinates is dVd = SdRd&#8722;1dR, 
Id = &#65533; &#8734; 
dRS dRd&#8722;1 e &#8722;R2 = Sd &#65533; &#8734; 
dyyd/2&#8722;1 e &#8722;y = Sd (d/2&#8722;1)!, (IV.30) 2 20 0

In the degenerate quantum limit, &#181; a pproaches its limiting value of zero. To see how this

to examine the limiting behavior of the functions f+(z) in eqs.(VII.35) as z = exp(&#946;&#181;)m

The origin of the T 3/2 behavior at low temperatures is easily understood. At T = 0 all 
particles occupy the /vectork = 0 state. At small but &#64257;nite temperatures there is occupation of 
states of &#64257;nite momentum, up to a value of approximately km such that h&#175;2k2 /2m = kBT .m
Each of these states has an energy proportional to kBT . The excitation energy in d 
d
imensions is thus given by E&#215; &#8733;Vkd kBT . The resulting heat capacity is CV &#8733;VkBT d/2 .m
The reasoning is similar to that used to calculate the heat capacities of a phonon (or 
photon) gas. The di&#64256;erence in the power laws simply originates from the di&#64256;erence in 
the energy spectrum of low energy excitations ( E(k)&#8733;k2 in the former and E(k)&#8733;k for 
the latter). In both cases the total number of excitations is not conserved, corresponding 
to &#181; = 0. For the bose gas, this lack of conservation only persists up to the transition 
temperature, at which point all particles are excited out of the reservoir with &#181; = 0 at 
/vectork = 0. CV is continuous at Tc, reaching a maximum value of approximately 1 .92kB per 
particle, but has a discontinuous derivative at this point.

n &#8727; = g&#950;3/2/&#955;3 &#8733;T 3/2, is then less than the total particle density. The remaining gas

vanishes as T 5/2 and is independent of d ensity . This is because only the excited fraction 
n &#8727; has &#64257;nite momentum and contributes to the pressure. Alternatively, bose condensation 
can be achieved at a &#64257;xed temperature by increasing density (reducing volume). From 
eq.(VII.54), the transition occurs at a speci&#64257;c volume 
1 &#955;3 
&#8727; v = &#8727; = . (VII.57) n g&#950;3/2 
For v &lt; v  &#8727;, the pressure&#8211;volume isotherm is &#64258;at, since &#8706;P/&#8706;v &#8733; &#8706; P/&#8706;n = 0 from 
eq.(VII.56). The &#64258;at portion of isotherms is reminiscent of coexisting liquid and gas phases. We can similarly regard bose condensation as the coexistence of a &#8220;normal gas&#8221; of 
speci&#64257;c volume v 
&#8727;, and a &#8220;liquid&#8221; of volume 0. The vanishing of the &#8220;liquid&#8221; volume is an 
unrealistic feature due to the absence of any interaction potential between the particles. 
Bose condensation combines features of discontinuous (&#64257;rst order), and continuous 
(second order) transitions; there is a &#64257;nite latent heat while the compressibility diverges. The latent heat of the transition can be obtained from the Clausius&#8211;Clapeyron  e
quation 
which gives the change of the transition temperature with pressure as

&#65533; As formulated within thermodynamics, the macrostate  M, of an ideal gas in equi&#173;
librium is described by a small number of state functions such as E, T, P, and N. The 
space of macrostates is considerably smaller than the phase space spanned by microstates. 
Therefore, there must be a very large number of microstates &#181; corresponding to the same 
macrostate M. 
This many to one correspondence suggests the introduction of a statistical ensemble  
o
f microstates. Consider N copies of a particular macrostate, each described by a di&#64256;erent 
representative  p oint &#181;n(t), in the phase space &#915;. Let dN(p,q, t) equal the number of 
&#65533;Nrepresentative points in an in&#64257;nitesimal volume d&#915; = i=1 d3/vector pid3q /vectori around the point 
(p,q). A phase space density &#961;(p,q, t) is then de&#64257;ned from 
dN(p,q, t)&#961;(p,q, t)d&#915; = lim . (III.2) 
N&#8594;&#8734; N 
This quantity can be compared with the objective  p robability introduced in the previous 
section. Clearly d&#915;&#961; = 1, and &#961; is a properly normalized probability  d ensity  f unction i n 
phase space. To compute macroscopic values for various functions O(p,q), we shall use 
the ensemble  a verages  
&#65533;
O&#65533; = d&#915;&#961;(p,q, t)O(p,q). (III.3) 
When the exact microstate &#181; is speci&#64257;ed, the system is said to be in a pure  s tate . 
On the other hand, when our knowledge of the system is probabilistic, in the sense of its 
being taken from an ensemble with density &#961;(&#915;), it is said to belong to a mixed  s tate . It 
is di&#64259;cult to describe equilibrium in the context of a pure state, since &#181;(t) is constantly 
changing in time according to eqs.(III.1). Equilibrium is more conveniently described for 
mixed states by examining the time evolution of the phase space density &#961;(t), which is 
governed by the Liouville&#8217;s equation introduced in the next section. 
III.B Liouville&#8217;s Theorem 
&#8226; Liouville&#8217;s Theorem states that the phase space density &#961;(&#915;, t), behaves like an 
incompressible  &#64258; uid. 
Proof: Follow the evolution of dN pure states in an in&#64257;nitesimal volume d&#915; = 
&#65533;N d3p /vectorid3/vector qi around the point (p ,q). According to eqs.(III.1), after an interval &#948;t these i=1 
states have moved to the vicinity of another point ( p &#8242; ,q &#8242;), where 
&#8242; &#8242; q&#945; = q&#945; + &#729;q&#945;&#948;t+ O(&#948;t2) , p&#945; = p&#945; + &#729;p&#945;&#948;t+ O(&#948;t2). (III.4)

          <text>&#65533; &#65533; must then be located on the surface H(p,q) = E in phase space. Eq.(III.9) implies 
that a uniform density of points on this surface is stationary in time. The assumption 
of statistical mechanics is that the macrostate is indeed represented by such a uniform 
density of microstates. This is equivalent to replacing the objective measure of probability 
in eq.(III.2) with a subjective one. 
There may be additional conserved  q uantities a ssociated with the Hamiltonian which 
satisfy {Ln,H} = 0. In the presence of such quantities, a stationary density exists for any 
function of the form &#961;eq(p,q) = &#961; H(p,q), L1(p,q), L2(p,q),&#183; &#183; &#183; . Clearly, the value of 
Ln is not changed during the evolution of the system, since 
dLn(p,q) Ln (p(t +dt),q(t+ dt))&#8722;Ln (p(t),q(t)) &#8801; dt dt 
3N &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#8706;Ln &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;Ln &#8706;q&#945; = &#183; + &#183; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;t &#8706;q &#945; &#8706;t (III.15) 
&#945;=1 
3N &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#8706;Ln &#8706;H &#8706;Ln &#8706;H = &#8722; &#183; &#8722; &#183; = {Ln,H} = 0. &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945;&#945;=1 
Hence, the functional dependence of &#961;eq on these quantities merely indicates that all ac&#173;
cessible  s tates , i.e. those that can be connected without violating any conservation law, 
are equally likely. (4) The above postulate for &#961;
eq answers the &#64257;rst question posed at the beginning of 
this chapter. However, in order to answer the second question, and to justify the basic 
assumption of statistical mechanics, we need to show that non-stationary densities converge 
onto the stationary solution &#961;eq. This contradicts the time reversal symmetry noted in (1) 
above: For any solution &#961;(t) converging to &#961;eq, there is a time reversed solution that 
diverges from it. The best that can be hoped for is to show that the solutions &#961;(t) are in 
the neighborhood of &#961;eq the majority of the time, so that time  a verages  a re dominated by 
the stationary solution. This brings us to the problem of ergodicity , which is whether it is 
justi&#64257;ed to replace time averages with ensemble averages. In measuring the properties of 
any system, we deal with only one representative of the equilibrium ensemble. However, 
most macroscopic properties do not have instantaneous values and require some form 
of averaging. For example, the pressure P exerted by a gas results from the impact of 
particles on the walls of the container. The number and momenta of these particles varies at di&#64256;erent times and di&#64256;erent locations. The measured pressure re&#64258;ects an average over 
many characteristic microscopic times. If over this time scale the representative point of 
45

        <slide>
          <slideno>5</slideno>
          <text>the system moves around and uniformly samples the accessible points in phase space, we 
may replace the time average with the ensemble average. For a few systems it is possible to prove an ergodic  t
heorem , which states that the representative point comes arbitrarily 
close to all accessible points in phase space after a su&#64259;ciently long time. However, the proof usually works for time intervals that grow exponentially with the number of particles 
N, and thus exceed by far any reasonable time scale over which the pressure of a gas is 
typically measured. As such the proofs of the ergodic theorem have so far little to do with 
the reality of macroscopic equilibrium.

&#65533; &#65533; where we have introduced the Poisson b racket  o f two functions in phase space as
3N &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#8706;A &#8706;B &#8706;A &#8706;B {A, B} &#8801; &#183; &#8722; &#183; = &#8722;{B, A}. (III.10) &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;q&#945;&#945;=1 
(1)Under the action of time reversal, ( p,q, t)&#8594; (&#8722;p,q,&#8722;t), the Poisson bracket {&#961;,H}
changes sign, and eq.(III.9) implies that the density reverses its evolution, i.e. &#961;(p,q, t) =
&#961;(&#8722;p,q,&#8722;t).
(2)The time evolution of the ensemble average in eq.(III.3) is given by (using eq.(III.9))
&#65533; 3N &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; d&#65533;O&#65533; &#8706;&#961;(p,q, t) &#8706;&#961; &#8706; H &#8706;&#961; &#8706; H = d&#915; O(p,q) = d&#915;O(p,q) &#183; &#8722; &#183; . dt &#8706;t &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945;&#945;=1 
(III.11) 
The partial derivatives of &#961; in the above equation can be removed by using the method 
of integration by parts, i.e. f&#961;&#8242; = &#8722; &#961;f&#8242; since &#961; vanishes on the boundaries of the 
integrations, leading to 
3N &#65533; &#65533;&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533;&#65533; d&#65533;O&#65533; &#65533; &#8706;O &#8706;H &#8706;O &#8706;H &#8706;2H &#8706;2H = &#8722; d&#915;&#961; &#183; &#8722; &#183; + O &#8722; dt &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;p&#945;&#8706;q&#945; &#8706;q&#945;&#8706;p&#945;&#945;=1 (III.12) 
= &#8722; d&#915;&#961;{H,O} = &#65533;{O,H}&#65533;. 
Note that the total time derivative cannot  b e taken inside the integral sign, i.e. 
d&#65533;O&#65533; d&#961;(p,q, t)&#65533;d&#915; (III.13) = O(p,q). dt dt 
This common mistake yields d&#65533;O&#65533;/dt= 0! 
(3) If the members of the ensemble correspond to an equilibrium macroscopic state, the 
ensemble averages must be independent of time. This can be achieved by a stationary 
density, &#8706;&#961;eq/&#8706;t= 0, i.e. by requiring 
{&#961;eq,H} = 0. (III.14) 
A possible solution to the above equation is for &#961;eq to be a function of H, i.e. &#961;eq(p,q) = 
&#961; H(p,q) . It is then easy to verify that {&#961;(H),H} = &#961;&#8242;(H){H,H} = 0. This solution 
implies that the value of &#961;is constant on surfaces of constant energy H, in phase space. This 
is indeed the basic  a ssumption o f s tatistical  m echanics . For example, in the microcanonical 
ensemble, the total energy E of an isolated system is speci&#64257;ed. All members of the ensemble

&#65533; In the above expression, the q&#945; and p&#945; refer to any of the 6N coordinates and momenta, 
and &#729;q&#945; and &#729;p&#945; are the corresponding velocities. The original volume element d&#915;, is in the 
shape of a hyper-cube of sides dp&#945; and dq&#945;. In the time interval &#948;t it gets distorted, and 
the projected sides of the new volume element are given by 
&#63729;
&#63732;
&#63732; dq &#945; &#8242; =dq&#945; + &#8706;q&#729;&#945;dq&#945;&#948;t+O(&#948;t2) &#63730; &#8706;q&#945; . (III.5) &#63732; &#8706;p&#729;&#945; &#63732; 
&#945; =dp&#945; + &#63731; dp &#8242; dp&#945;&#948;t+O(&#948;t2)&#8706;p&#945; 
&#65533;N &#8242;To order of &#948;t2, the new volume element is d&#915;&#8242; = i=1 d3p /vectori &#8242;d3q /vectori . From eqs.(III.5) it 
follows that for each pair of conjugate coordinates 
dq &#945; &#8242; dp &#8242; dq&#945; dp&#945; &#8706;q&#729;&#945; + &#8706;p&#729;&#945; . &#183; &#945; = &#183; 1 + &#948;t+ O(&#948;t2) (III.6) &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945; 
But since the time evolution of coordinates and momenta are governed by the canonical 
eqs.(III.1), we have 
&#8706;q&#729;&#945; &#8706; &#8706;H &#8706;2H &#8706;p&#729;&#945; &#8706; &#65533; &#8706;H &#65533; &#8706;2H = = , and = &#8722; = &#8722; . (III.7) &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;p&#945;&#8706;q&#945; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;p&#945; &#8706;q&#945; &#8706;q&#945;&#8706;p&#945; 
Thus the projected area in eq.(III.6) is unchanged for any pair of coordinates, and hence 
the volume element is una&#64256;ected, d&#915;&#8242; = d&#915;. All the pure states dN, originally in the 
vicinity of ( p,q) are transported to the neighborhood of ( p &#8242; ,q &#8242;), but occupy exactly the

incompressible &#64258;uid. 
The incompressibility condition &#961;(p &#8242; ,q &#8242; , t + &#948;t) = &#961;(p,q, t), can be written in di&#64256;er&#173;

Note the distinction between &#8706;&#961;/&#8706;t and d&#961;/dt: The former partial d erivative refers to the 
changes in &#961; at a particular location in phase space, while the latter total  d erivative follows 
the evolution of a volume of &#64258;uid as it moves in phase space. Substituting from eq.(III.1) into eq.(III.8) leads to

          <text>III. Kinetic Theory of Gases
III.A General De&#64257;nitions 
&#8226; Kinetic theory studies the macroscopic properties of large numbers of particles, start&#173;
ing from their (classical) equations of motion. 
Thermodynamics describes the equilibrium behavior of macroscopic  o bjects  i n terms 
of concepts such as work, heat, and entropy. The phenomenological laws of thermody&#173;
namics tell us how these quantities are constrained as a system approaches its equilibrium. At the microscopic  l
evel , we know that these systems are composed of particles (atoms, 
molecules), whose interactions and dynamics are reasonably well understood in terms of more fundamental theories. If these microscopic descriptions are complete, we should be able to account for the macroscopic behavior, i.e. derive the laws governing the macro&#173;
scopic state functions in equilibrium. Kinetic theory attempts to achieve this objective. 
In particular, we shall try to answer the following questions: 
(1) How can we de&#64257;ne &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; for a system of moving particles? 
(2) Do all systems naturally evolve towards an equilibrium state? 
(3) What is the time evolution of a system that is not quite in equilibrium? The simplest system to study, the veritable work&#8211;horse of thermodynamics, is the 
dilute (nearly ideal) gas. A typical volume of gas contains of the order of 10
23 particles. 
Kinetic theory attempts to deduce the macroscopic properties of the gas from the time evolution of the individual atomic coordinates. At any time t, the microstate  o
f a system 
of N particles is described by specifying the positions /vector qi(t), and momenta p /vectori(t), of all 
particles. The microstate thus corresponds to a point &#181;(t), in the 6 N dimensional phase  
&#65533;N space  &#915; = i=1{/vector qi, /vector pi}. The time evolution of this point is governed by the canonical 
equations &#63729; &#8706;/vector qi &#8706;H &#63732; &#63732; = &#63730; &#8706;t &#8706;/vector p i , (III.1) &#63732; &#8706;/vector pi &#8706;H &#63732; &#63731; = &#8722; &#8706;t &#8706;/vector qi 
where the Hamiltonian  H(p,q) , describes the total energy in terms of the set of coordinates 
q &#8801; {/vector q1,/vector q2,&#183; &#183; &#183; ,/vector qN}, and momenta p &#8801; {p /vector1, /vector p2,&#183; &#183; &#183; , /vector pN}. The microscopic equations of 
motion have time  r eversal  s ymmetry , i.e. if all the momenta are suddenly reversed, p &#8594; 
&#8722;p, at t = 0, the particles retrace their previous trajectory, q(t) = q(&#8722;t). This follows 
from the invariance of H under the transformation T(p,q)&#8594; (&#8722;p,q).

The quantum partition function thus involves a sum over N! possible permutations. The 
classical result ZN = /parenleftbig 
V/&#955;3/parenrightbigN /N!, is obtained from the term corresponding to no particle 
exchange, Q &#8801;1 . The division by N! &#64257;nally justi&#64257;es the factor that was (somewhat 
arti&#64257;cially) introduces in classical statistical mechanics to deal with the phase space of 
identical particles. However, this classical result is only valid at very high temperature and is modi&#64257;ed by the quantum corrections coming from the remaining permutations. As any permutation involves a product of factors exp[ &#8722;&#960;(/vector x
1 &#8722;/vector x2)2/&#955;2], its contributions 
vanishes as &#955; 0 for T &#8594; &#8734; . &#8594;
The lowest order correction comes from the simplest permutation which is the ex&#173;
change of two particles. The exchange of particles 1 and 2 is accompanied by a factor of &#951; e 
xp[&#8722;2&#960;(/vector x1&#8722;/vector x2)2/&#955;2]. As each of the possible N(N &#8722;1 )/2 pairwise exchanges gives the

The resulting correction to pressure is negative for bosons, and positive for fermions. In the

The classical potential V(/vector r ) that leads to the second virial coe&#64259;cient in eq.(VII.22) is

(The &#64257;nal approximation corresponds to high temperatures, where only the &#64257;rst correc&#173;
tion is important). Thus the e&#64256;ects of quantum statistics at high temperatures are ap&#173;
proximately equivalent to introducing an interaction between particles. The interaction is 
attractive for bosons, repulsive for fermions, and operates over distances of the order of 
the thermal wavelength &#955;.

These sums are still di&#64259;cult to perform due to the restrictions of symmetry on the allowed

more than once in the above list, the result is zero and there is no anti-symmetrized

In this case, there are N! terms in the above sum, and N&#8722; = N! is necessary to ensure 
normalization. For example, a two&#8211;particle anti-symmetrized state is

VII.A  H ilbert  S pace o f I dentical P articles 
In chapter IV, we discussed the Gibbs paradox for the mixing entropy of gases of 
identical particles. This di&#64259;culty was overcome by postulating that the phase space for N 
i
dentical particles must be divided by N!, the number of permutations. This is not quite 
satisfactory as the classical equations of motion implicitly treat the particles as distinct. 
In quantum mechanics, by contrast, the identity of particles appears at the level of allowed states in Hilbert space. For example, the probability of &#64257;nding two identical particles at positions /vector x
1 and /vector x2 is |&#936;(/vector x1,/vector x2)|2 . Since the exchange of particles 1 and 2 leads to 
the same con&#64257;gurations, we must have |&#936;(/vector x1,/vector x2)|2 = |&#936;(/vector x2,/vector x1)|2 . For a single-valued 
function, this leads to two possibilities: 
|&#968;(1, 2 )/an}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= +|&#968;(2, 1 )/an}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht, or |&#968;(1, 2 )/an}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= &#8722;|&#968;(2, 1 )/an}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht . (VII.1) 
The Hilbert space used to describe identical particles is thus restricted to obey certain symmetries. 
For a system of N i
dentical particles, there are N! permutations P , forming a group 
SN. There are several ways for representing a permutation; e.g., P ( 1 2 3 4) = (3 2 4 1) 
for N = 4 can alternatively be indicated by 
&#63723; &#63734; 
1
2 3 4 
P = &#63725; &#63736; .  (VII.2) 
3 2 4 1 
Any permutation can be obtained from a sequence of two particle exchanges. For example, 
the above permutation is obtained by the exchanges (1,3) and (1,4) performed in sequence. 
The parity  o f a permutation is de&#64257;ned as 
(&#8722;1)P +1 if P i nvolves to an even  n umber of exchanges, e.g. (1 2 3) &#8594;(2 3 1) . &#8801;&#8722;1 if P i nvolves an odd n umber of exchanges, e.g. (1 2 3) (2 1 3) &#8594;
(Note that if lines are drawn connecting the initial an &#64257;nal locations of each integer in 
eq.(VII.2), the parity is ( &#8722;1) raised to the number of intersections of these lines.) 
The action of permutations on an N&#8211;particle quantum state leads to a representation  
o
f the permutation group in Hilbert space. Requiring the wave-function to be single valued, 
and to give equal probabilities under particle exchange, restricts the representation to be

in nature: 
(1) Bosons  c orrespond to the fully symmetric representation such that

Of course, the Hamiltonian for identical particles must itself be symmetric, i.e. P H= 
H. H
owever, for a given H, there are many eigen-states with di&#64256;erent symmetries under 
permutations. To select the correct set of eigen-states, in quantum mechanics the statistics 
of the particles (bosons or fermions) is speci&#64257;ed independently. For example, consider N

at zero temperature has &#64257;nite pressure and internal energy. 
The low temperature expansion for the internal energy is obtained easily from 
eq.(VII.47) using

temperature heat capacity, 
dE &#960;2 /parenleftbigg T /parenrightbigg /parenleftbigg T /parenrightbigg2 
CV = dT =2 NkB TF + O TF . (VII.49) 
The linear vanishing of the heat capacity as T 0 is a general feature of a fermi gas, valid &#8594;
in all dimensions. It has the following simple physical interpretation: The probability 
of occupying single-particle states, eq.(VII.40), is very close to a step function at small 
temperatures. Only particles within a distance of approximately kBT of the fermi energy 
can be thermally excited. This represents only a small fraction T/T F, of the total number 
of electrons. Each excited particle gains an energy of the order of kBT , leading to a 
change in the internal energy of approximately kBTN(T/T F). Hence the heat capacity 
is given by CV = dE/dT  &#8764;N k BT/T F. This conclusion is also valid for an interacting 
fermi gas. The fact that only a small number, N(T/T F), of fermions are excited at small 
temperatures accounts for many interesting properties of fermi gases. For example, the 
magnetic susceptibility of a classical gas of N n on-interacting particles of magnetic moment 
&#181;B follows the Curie law, &#967; &#8733;N &#181;2 /(kBT ). Since quantum mechanically, only a fraction B
of spins contributes at low temperatures, the low temperature susceptibility saturates to a 
(Pauli) value of &#967; &#8733;N &#181;2 /(kBTF). (See review problems for the details of this calculation.) B

Note, however, that a change of variables is necessary to express H in terms of T, rather

Helmholtz Free energy is useful for isothermal transformations in the absence of 
mechanical work ( &#175; 0). From Clausius&#8217;s theorem, the heat intake of a system at a dW = 
constant temperature T satis&#64257;es dQ &#175;&#8804; T&#948;S. Hence &#948;E =&#175; &#175;dQ+dW &#8804; T&#948;S, and 
&#948;F &#8804; 0, where F = E &#8722;TS (I.34) 
is the Helmholtz free energy. Since 
dF = dE &#8722;d(TS) = TdS +J&#183; dx &#8722;SdT &#8722;TdS = &#8722;SdT + J&#183; dx, (I.35) 
the coordinate set ( T,x) (the quantities kept constant during an isothermal transformation 
with no work) is most suitable for describing the free energy. The equilibrium forces and 
entropy can be obtained from

Table 2: Inequalities satis&#64257;ed by thermodynamic potentials. 
Table (2) summarizes the above results on thermodynamic functions. Eqs.(I.30), 
(I.34), and (I.38) are examples of Legendre transformations, used to change variables 
to the most natural set of coordinates for describing a particular situation. So far, we 
implicitly assumed a constant number of particles in the system. In chemical reactions, 
and in equilibrium between two phases, the number of particles in a given constituent may change. The change in the number of particles necessarily involves changes in the 
internal energy, which is expressed in terms of a chemical  work &#175;= &#181; &#183; dN. 
 Here dW 
N = {N1, N2,&#183; &#183; &#183;} lists the number of particles of each species, and &#181; = {&#181;1, &#181;2,&#183; &#183; &#183;} the 
associated chemical potentials which measure the work necessary to add additional particles 
t
o the system. Traditionally, chemical work is treated di&#64256;erently from mechanical work and 
is not subtracted from E in the Gibbs free energy of eq.(I.38). For chemical equilibrium 
in circumstances that involve no mechanical work, the appropriate state function is the Grand Potential given by 
G = E &#8722;TS &#8722;&#181;&#183; N . (I.40) 
G(T, &#181;,x) is minimized in chemical equilibrium, and its variations in general satisfy 
dG = &#8722;SdT &#8722;J&#183; dx &#8722;N&#183; d&#181; . (I.41) 
Example: To illustrate the concepts of this section, consider N particles of supersaturated 
steam in a container of volume V at a temperature T. How can we describe the approach 
of steam to an equilibrium mixture with N

Before the system reaches equilibrium at a particular value of Nw, it goes through a series 
of non-equilibrium states with smaller amounts of water. If the process is su&#64259;ciently slow, 
we can construct an out of equilibrium value for F as 
F(V, T, N |Nw) = Fw(T, N w) +Fs(V, T, N &#8722;Nw), (I.43) 
which depends on an additional variable Nw. (It is assumed that the volume occupied by 
water is small and irrelevant.) According to eq.(I.34), the equilibrium point is obtained by minimizing F with respect to this variable. Since

the chemical potentials, i.e. from &#181;w(V, T) = &#181;s(V, T). The identity of chemical potentials 
is the condition for chemical equilibrium. Naturally, to proceed further we need expressions for &#181;
w and &#181;s.

(1) Extensivity: Including chemical work, variations of the extensive  coordinates of the 
s
ystem are related by (generalizing eq.(I.28)) 
dE = TdS + J&#183; dx +&#181;&#183; dN. (I.45) 
For &#64257;xed intensive coordinates, the extensive quantities are simply proportional to size or 
to the number of particles. This proportionality is expressed mathematically by 
E(&#955;S, &#955;x, &#955;N) = &#955;E(S,x,N). (I.46)

          <text>I.G Approach to Equilibrium and Thermodynamic Potentials 
Evolution of non-equilibrium systems towards equilibrium is governed by the second 
law of thermodynamics. For example, in the previous section we showed that for an adia&#173;
batically isolated system entropy must increase in any spontaneous change and reaches a 
maximum in equilibrium. What about out of equilibrium systems that are not adiabati&#173;
cally isolated and which may also be subject to external mechanical work? It is usually possible to de&#64257;ne other thermodynamic potentials that are extremized when the system is in equilibrium. 
Enthalpy is the appropriate function when there is no heat exchange ( dQ &#175;= 0), and 
the system comes to mechanical equilibrium with a constant external  force. 
The minimum 
enthalpy principle merely formulates the observation that stable mechanical equilibrium is obtained by minimizing the net potential energy of the system plus the external agent. For example, consider a spring of natural extension L
0 and spring constant K, subject to 
the force exerted by a particle of mass m. For an extension x = L&#8722;L0, the internal energy 
of the spring is Kx2/2, while there is a change of &#8722;mgx in the potential energy of the 
particle. Mechanical equilibrium is obtained by minimizing Kx2/2&#8722;mgx at an extension 
xeq = mg/K . The spring at any other value of the displacement initially oscillates before 
coming to rest at xeq due to friction. For general displacements x, at constant generalized 
forces J, the work input to the system is dW &#175;&#8804; J&#183; &#948;x. (Equality is achieved for a reversible 
change, but there is generally some loss of the external work into friction.) Since dQ = 0, &#175;
using the &#64257;rst law, &#948;E &#8804; J&#183; &#948;x, and 
&#948;H &#8804; 0, where H = E &#8722;J&#183; x (I.30) 
is the enthalpy. The variations of H in equilibrium  are given by 
d
H = dE &#8722;d(J&#183; x) = TdS + J&#183; dx &#8722;x &#183; dJ&#8722;J&#183; dx = TdS &#8722;x &#183; dJ . (I.31) 
The equality in eq.(I.31), and the inequality in eq.(I.30), are a possible source of confusion. Note that eq.(I.30) refers to variations of H on approaching equilibrium as some parameter 
that is not a function of state is varied (e.g. the velocity of the particle joined to the spring 
in the above example). By contrast eq.(I.31) describes a relation between equilibrium 
coordinates. To di&#64256;erentiate the two cases, I will denoted the former non-equilibrium variations by &#948;.

&#181;&#945; respectively. Substituting these values into eq.(I.47) leads to the so called fundamental 
equation of thermodynamics 
E = TS + J&#183; x + &#181;&#183; N. (I.48) 
Combining the variations of eq.(I.48) with eq.(I.45) leads to a constraint between the 
variations of intensive coordinates

E
xample: For a &#64257;xed amount of gas ( dN = 0), variations of the chemical potential along 
an isotherm can be calculated as follows. Since dT = 0, the Gibbs-Duhem relation gives 
&#8722;V dP +Nd&#181; = 0, and 
V dP d&#181; = dP = kBT , (I.50) N P 
where we have used the ideal gas equation of state PV = NkBT. Integrating the above 
equation gives

where ( P0, V0, &#181;0) refer to the coordinates of a reference point. 
(2) Maxwell&#8217;s Relations: Combining the mathematical rules of di&#64256;erentiation with 
thermodynamic relationships leads to several useful results. The most important of these are Maxwell&#8217;s relations which follow from the commutative property [ &#8706;
x&#8706;yf(x, y) = 
&#8706;y&#8706;xf(x, y)] of derivatives. For example, it follows from eq.(I.45) that 
&#8706;E /vextendsingle &#8706;E /vextendsingle /vextendsingle = T, and /vextendsingle = Ji. (I.52) &#8706;S x,N &#8706;xi S,xj=&#65533;i,N 
The joint second derivative of E is then given by 
&#8706;2E &#8706;2E &#8706;T /vextendsingle/vextendsingle &#8706;Ji/vextendsingle/vextendsingle 
= = /vextendsingle = . (I.53) &#8706;S&#8706;xi &#8706;xi&#8706;S &#8706;x iS &#8706;S xi 
Since ( &#8706;y/&#8706;x ) = (&#8706;x/&#8706;y )&#8722;1, the above equation can be inverted to give 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle &#8706;xi/vextendsingle /vextendsingle = /vextendsingle . (I.54) &#8706;Jixi &#8706;T S

/vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle Similar identities can be obtained from the variations of other state functions. Sup&#173;
posing that we are interested in &#64257;nding an identity involving &#8706;S/&#8706;x |T. We would like 
to &#64257;nd a state function whose variations include SdT and Jdx. The correct choice is 
dF = d(E&#8722;TS) = &#8722;SdT+Jdx. Looking at the second derivative of F yields the Maxwell 
relation 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle &#8706;J /vextendsingle 
&#8722; = . (I.55) &#8706;x &#8706;T T x 
To calculate &#8706;S/&#8706;J |T, consider d(E&#8722;TS&#8722;Jx) = &#8722;SdT&#8722;xdJ, which leads to the identity 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle &#8706;x /vextendsingle /vextendsingle = /vextendsingle . (I.56) &#8706;J &#8706;T T J 
There are a variety of mnemonics which are supposed to help you remember and construct 
Maxwell&#8217;s equations, such as Magic Squares, Jacobians, etc. I personally don&#8217;t &#64257;nd any of 
these methods worth learning. The most logical approach is to remember the laws of ther&#173;
modynamics and hence eq.(I.28), and to then manipulate it so as to &#64257;nd the appropriate derivative using the rules of di&#64256;erentiation. 
Example: To obtain &#8706;&#181;/&#8706;P |
N,T for an ideal gas, start with d(E&#8722;TS+PV) = &#8722;SdT + 
V dP + &#181;dN. Clearly /vextendsingle /vextendsingle &#8706;&#181; /vextendsingle &#8706;V /vextendsingle V kBT /vextendsingle = /vextendsingle = = , (I.57) &#8706;P /vextendsingle &#8706;N /vextendsingle N PN,T T,P 
as in eq.(I.50). From eq.(I.28) it also follows that 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle P &#8706;E/&#8706;V |S,N /vextendsingle = = &#8722; , (I.58) &#8706;V E,N T &#8706;E/&#8706;S |V,N 
where we have used eq.(I.45) for the &#64257;nal identity. The above equation can be rearranged 
into 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle &#8706;E /vextendsingle &#8706;V /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle /vextendsingle = &#8722;1, (I.59) &#8706;V &#8706;S &#8706;E E,N V,N S,N 
which is an illustration of the chain rule of di&#64256;erentiation.

V.F Variational Methods 
Perturbative methods provide a systematic way of incorporating the e&#64256;ect of inter&#173;
actions, but are impractical for the study of strongly interacting systems. While the &#64257;rst 
few terms in the virial series slightly modify the behavior of the gas, an in&#64257;nite number 
of terms have to be summed to obtain the condensation transition. An alternative, but 
approximate , method for dealing with strongly interacting systems is the use of variational 
methods. 
&#8722;&#946;H/parenrightBig 
Suppose that in an appropriate ensemble we need to calculate Z
= tr e
 .
In the
canonical formulation, Z i s the partition function corresponding to the Hamiltonian H at 
temperature kBT = 1/&#946;, and for a classical system tr refers to the integral over the phase 
space of N p articles. However, the method is more general and can be applied to Gibbs or 
Grand partition functions with the appropriate modi&#64257;cation of the exponential factor; also in the context of quantum systems where tr is a sum over all allowed quantum microstates. 
Let us assume that calculating Z i
s very di&#64259;cult for the (interacting) Hamiltonian H, but 
that there is another Hamiltonian H0 acting on the same set of degrees of freedom for which 
the calculations are easier. We then introduce a Hamiltonian H(&#955;) = H0 + &#955; (H &#8722; H 0), 
and a corresponding partition function 
Z(&#955;) = tr{exp [&#8722;&#946;H0 &#8722;&#955;&#946; (H &#8722; H 0)]}, ( V.70) 
which interpolates between the two as &#955; c hanges from zero to one. It is then easy to prove 
the convexity condition 
d2 lnZ(&#955;) = d&#955;2 &#946;2(H &#8722; H 0)2&#8805; 0, ( V.71)
c 
where &#8733;an}bracketle{t&#8733;an}bracketri}ht is an expectation value with the appropriately normalized probability. 
From the convexity of the function, it immediately follows that 
d lnZ
lnZ(&#955;)&#8805; lnZ(0) +&#955;
 .  (V.72)
d&#955;
&#955;=0 
0But it is easy to see that d l nZ/d&#955;|&#955;=0 = &#946; &#8733;an}bracketle{tH0 &#8722; H&#8733;an}bracketri}ht , where the superscript indicates 
expectation values with respect to H0. Setting &#955; = 1, we obtain 
0 0lnZ &#8805; l nZ(0) +&#946; &#8733;an}bracketle{t H 0&#8733;an}bracketri}ht &#8722;&#946; &#8733;an}bracketle{t H&#8733;an}bracketri}ht. ( V.73)

rescalings of state functions. The most natural choice of scales for pressure, volume, and 
temperature are those of the critical point, (P c,Vc,Tc). 
The van der Waals equation is an example of a generalized equation of state. Its 
critical point is found by setting &#8706;P/&#8706;V  |T and &#8706;2P/&#8706;V 2to zero. The former is the T 
limit of the &#64258;at coexistence portion of liquid/gas isotherms; the latter follows from the 
stability requirement &#954;T &gt; 0 (see the discussion after eq.(I.72)). The coordinates of the 
critical point are thus obtained from solving the following coupled equations, 
&#63729; 
&#63732;&#63732;&#63732;&#63732;&#63732;&#63732;&#63732;&#63730;

&#8706;v2 2kBT 6a = &#8722; =0 (v &#8722;b)3 4vT 
where v = V /N i s the volume per particle. The solution to these equations is

aturally, the critical point depends on the microscopic Hamiltonian (e.g. on the 2&#173;
body interaction) via the parameters a a nd b. However, we can scale out such dependencies 
by measuring P , T , and v i n units of Pc, Tc and vc. Setting Pr = P/P c, vr = v/vc, and 
Tr = T/T c, a reduced version of the van der Waals equation is obtained as 
8 Tr 3 Pr = 3 vr &#8722;1/3 &#8722; vr 2 . (V.79) 
We have thus constructed a universal (material independent) equation of state. Since the 
original van der Waals equation depends only on two two parameters, eqs.(V.78) predict 
a universal dimensionless ratio, 
Pcvc 3 = = 0.375. ( V.80) kBTc 8 
Experimentally, this ratio is found to be in the range of 0 .28 to 0.33. The van der Waals 
equation is thus not a good candidate for the putative universal equation of state.

Note that the third and &#64257;fth terms are of comparable magnitude for ( T &#8722;Tc)&#8764; (v &#8722;vc)2 . 
The fourth (and higher order terms) can then be neglected when this condition is satis&#64257;ed. 
&#8226; The analytic expansion of eq.(V.83) results in the following predictions for behavior
close to the critical point:
(a) The gas compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point from the high tem&#173;
perature side, along the critical isochore ( v = v

(b) The critical isotherm ( T = Tc) behaves as 
c P = Pc &#8722; (v &#8722;vc)3 +&#183; &#183; &#183; . ( V.85) 6
(c) Eq.(V.83) is manifestly inapplicable to T &lt; T c. However, we can try to extract infor&#173;
mation for the low temperature side by applying the Maxwell construction to the unstable 
c isotherms. Actually, dimensional considerations are su&#64259;cient to show that on approaching 
Tc from the low temperature side, the speci&#64257;c volumes of the coexisting liquid and gas 
phases approach each other as 
lim (vgas &#8722;vliquid)&#8733; (Tc &#8722;T )1/2 . (V.86) 
T&#8594;T&#8722; 
c The liquid&#8211;gas transition for T &lt; T c is accompanied by a discontinuity in density, 
and the release of latent heat L. This kind of transition is usually referred to as &#64257;rst 
order or discontinuous. The di&#64256;erence between the two phases disappears as the line of 
&#64257;rst order transitions terminates at the critical point. The singular behavior at this point 
is attributed to a second order or continuous transition. Eq.(V.83) follows from no more 
than the constraints of mechanical stability, and the assumption of analytical isotherms. 
Although there are some unknown coe&#64259;cients, eqs.(V.85)&#8211;(V.86) predict universal forms 
for the singularities close to the critical point and can be compared to experimental data. The experimental results do indeed con&#64257;rm the general expectations of singular behavior, 
and there is universality in the results for di&#64256;erent gases which can be summarized as 
(a) The compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point as 
lim &#954;(T,v
c)&#8733; (T &#8722;Tc)&#8722;&#947; , with &#947; &#8776; 1.3 . ( V.87)

          <text>Eq.(V.73), known as the Gibbs inequality , is the basis for most variational estimates. 
Typically, the &#8216;simpler&#8217; Hamiltonian H0 (and hence the right hand side of eq.(V.73)) in&#173;
cludes several parameters {n&#945;}. The best estimate for ln Z i s obtained by &#64257;nding the 
maximum of the right hand side with respect to these parameters. It can now be checked 
that the approximate evaluation of the grand partition function Q in the preceding sec&#173;
tion is equivalent to a variational treatment with H0 corresponding to a gas of hard-core 
particles of density n, for which (after replacing the sum by its dominant term) 
lnQ0 = &#946;&#181;N + lnZ = V /bracketleftbigg

 (V.74) 2 
The di&#64256;erence H&#8722;H 0 contains the attractive portion of the two body interactions. In the 
regions of phase space not excluded by the hard core interactions the gas in H0 is described 
by a uniform density n. Hence

which is the same as eq.(V.66). The density n i s now a parameter on the right hand side 
of eq.(V.76). Obtaining the best variational estimate by maximizing with respect to n i s 
then equivalent to eq.(V.65). 
V.G Corresponding States 
We now have a good perturbative understanding of the behavior of a dilute interacting 
gas at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, attractive interactions lead to conden&#173;
sation into the liquid state. The qualitative behavior of the phase diagram is the same for most simple gases. There is a line of transitions in the coordinates ( P,T )
(corresponding 
to the coexistence of liquid and gas in the (V,T  ) plane) that terminates at a so called 
critical point . It is thus possible to transform a liquid to a gas without encountering any 
singularities. Since the ideal gas law is universal, i.e. independent of material, we may hope that there is also a generalized universal equation of state (presumably more com&#173;plicated) that describes interacting gases, including liquid/gas condensation phenomena. This hope motivated the search for a law of corresponding states , obtained by appropriate

We can attempt to construct a generalized equation empirically by using three inde&#173;
pendent critical coordinates, and &#64257;nding Pr &#8801; pr(vr,Tr) from the collapse of experimental 
data. Such an approach has some limited success in describing similar gases, e.g. the 
sequence of noble gases Ne, Xe, Kr, etc. However, di&#64256;erent types of gases (e.g. diatomic, 
ionic, etc.) show rather di&#64256;erent behaviors. This is not particularly surprising given the 
di&#64256;erences in the underlying Hamiltonians. We know rigorously from the virial expansion 
that perturbative treatment of the interacting gas does depend on the details of the mi&#173;
croscopic potential. Thus the hope of &#64257;nding a universal equation of state for all liquids 
and gases has no theoretical or experimental justi&#64257;cation; each case has to be studied 
separately starting from its microscopic Hamiltonian. It is thus quite surprising that the 
collapse of experimental data does in fact work very well in the vicinity of the critical 
point, as described in the next section. 
V.H Critical Point Behavior 
To account for the universal behavior of gases close to their critical point, let us 
examine the isotherms in the vicinity of ( Pc,vc,Tc). For T &#8805; Tc, a Taylor expansion of

Since &#8706;P/&#8706;v |T and &#8706;2P/&#8706;v2are both zero at Tc, the expansion of the derivatives around T

requires a &gt; 0 (for T &gt; T c) and c &gt; 0 (for T = Tc), but provides no information on the 
sign of b. If an analytical expansion is possible, the isotherms of any gas in the vicinity of 
its critical point must have the general form, 
P (T,v) = Pc+&#945;(T &#8722;Tc)&#8722;a(T &#8722;Tc)(v&#8722;vC)+ b (T &#8722;Tc)(v&#8722;vc)2&#8722; c (v&#8722;vc)3+&#183; &#183; &#183; . ( V.83) 2 6

can maximize 
S(&#945;, &#946;,{pi}) = &#8722; p(i) lnp(i)&#8722;&#945; p (i)&#8722;1 &#8722;&#946; p (i)F(xi)&#8722;f , (II.70)

malization, and &#8733;an}bracketle{tF(x)&#8733;an}bracketri}ht= f, respectively. The result of the optimization is a distribution 
pi &#8733;exp &#8722;&#946;F(xi) , where the value of &#946; is &#64257;xed by the constraint. This process can 
be generalized to an arbitrary number of conditions. It is easy to see that if the &#64257;rst n 
moments (and hence n cumulants) of a distribution are speci&#64257;ed, the unbiased estimate is 
the exponential of an nth order polynomial. 
In analogy with eq.(II.68), we can de&#64257;ne an entropy for a continuous random variable 
(Sx = {&#8722;&#8734; &lt; x &lt; &#8734;}) as 
S = &#8722; dx p(x) lnp(x) = &#8722;&#8733;an}bracketle{tlnp(x)&#8733;an}bracketri}ht . (II.71) 
There are, however, problems with this de&#64257;nition, as for example S is not invariant under 
a one to one mapping. (After a change of variable to f = F(x), the entropy is changed 
by &#8733;an}bracketle{t|F &#8242; (x)|&#8733;</text>

With more than one random variable, the set of outcomes is an N-dimensional space, 
Sx = {&#8722;&#8734; &lt; x1, x2,&#183;&#183;&#183; , xN &lt; &#8734;}. For example, describing the location and velocity of a 
gas particle requires six coordinates. 
&#8226; The j oint PDF  p(x) , is the probability density of an outcome in a volume element 
dNx = /producttextN dxi around the point x = {x1, x2, , x N}. The joint PDF is normalized i=1 &#183;&#183;&#183; 
such that 
px(S) = dN x p(x) = 1 . (II.32) 
If, and only if, the N random variables are independent, the joint PDF is the product of 
individual PDFs, 
N 
p(x) = pi(xi) . (II.33) 
i=1 
&#8226; The u nconditional  P DF d escribes the behavior of a subset of random variables, indepen&#173;
dent of the values of the others. For example, if we are interested only in the location of 
a gas particle, an unconditional PDF can be constructed by integrating over all velocities 
at a given location, p(/vector x) = d3/vector v p(/vector x,/vector v); more generally 
/integraldisplay N 
p(x1, , x m) = dxi p(x1, , x N). (II.34) &#183;&#183;&#183; &#183;&#183;&#183; 
i=m+1 
&#8226; The c onditional P DF describes the behavior of a subset of random variables, for speci&#64257;ed 
values of the others. For example, the PDF for the velocity of a particle at a particular location /vector x, denoted by p(/vector v |/vector x), is proportional to the joint PDF p(/vector v |/vector x) = p(/vector x,/vector v)/N. 
The constant of proportionality, obtained by normalizing p(/vector v /vector x), is |
N= d
3/vector v p(/vector x,/vector v) = p(/vector x), (II.35) 
the unconditional PDF for a particle at /vector x. In general, the unconditional PDFs are obtained 
from Bayes&#8217;  T heorem  a s 
p(x1, x m+1,p(x1,&#183;&#183;&#183; , xN) &#183;&#183;&#183; , xm | &#183;&#183;&#183; , xN) = p(xm+1, , x N) . (II.36) &#183;&#183;&#183; 
Note that if the random variables are independent, the unconditional PDF is equal to the conditional PDF.

still be evaluated by a similar method. The integrand can be written as exp N&#966;(x) , with 
&#966;(x) = ln x&#8722;x/N. The exponent has a maximum at xmax = N, with &#966;(xmax) = ln N &#8722;1, 
and &#966; &#8242;&#8242; (xmax) = &#8722;1/N2 . Expanding the integrand in eq.(II.61) around this point yields,

II.G Information, Entropy, and Estimation 
&#8226; Information: Consider a random variable with a discrete set of outcomes S= {xi}, 
occurring with probabilities {p(i)}, for i = 1, , M . In the context of information theory, &#183;&#183;&#183; 
there is a precise meaning to the information  c ontent of a probability distribution: Let us 
construct a message from N independent outcomes of the random variable. Since there are 
M possibilities for each character in this message, it has an apparent information content of 
N ln2 M bits; i.e. this many binary bits of information have to be transmitted to convey the 
message precisely. On the other hand, the probabilities {p(i)}limit the types of messages 
that are likely. For example, if p2 p1, it is very unlikely to construct a message with &#8811;
more x1 than x2. In particular, in the limit of large N, we expect the message to contain 
&#8220;roughly&#8221; {Ni = Npi}occurrences of each symbol.&#8224; The number of typical messages thus 
corresponds to the number of ways of rearranging the {Ni}occurrences of {xi}, and is 
given by the multinomial coe&#64259;cient 
N! g = /producttextM . (II.64) 
Ni!i=1 
This is much smaller than the total number of messages Mn . To specify one out of g 
possible sequences requires 
M

&#8224; More precisely, the probability of &#64257;nding any Ni that is di&#64256;erent from Npi by more 
than &#177;&#8730;
N becomes exponentially small in N, as N &#8594; &#8734;.

generalizing the result obtained previously for the binomial distribution. For large values 
of N, the average value of the sum is proportional to N, while &#64258;uctuations around the 
mean, as measured by the standard deviation, grow only as &#8730;
N. The random variable 
nN1&#8722;m/2y = (X &#8722;N &#8733;an}bracketle{tx&#8733;an}bracketri}htc)/&#8730;
N, has zero mean, and cumulants that scale as &#8733;an}bracketle{ty&#8733;an}bracketri}htc &#8733; . As 
N &#8594; &#8734;, only the second cumulant survives, and the PDF for y converges to the normal 
distribution ,

(Note that the Gaussian distribution is the only distribution with only &#64257;rst and second cumulants.) 
The convergence of the PDF for the sum of many random variables to a normal 
distribution is a most important result in the context of statistical mechanics where such sums are frequently encountered. The central  l
imit  t heorem  s tates a more general form of 
this result: It is not necessary for the random variables to be independent, as the condition

i1,&#183;&#183;&#183;,im &#8733;an}bracketle{txi1 xim &#8733;an}bracketri}htc &#8810; O(Nm/2), is su&#64259;cient for the validity of eq.(II.49). &#183;&#183;&#183; 
II.F Rules for Large Numbers 
To describe equilibrium properties of macroscopic bodies, statistical mechanics has to 
deal with the very large number N, of microscopic degrees of freedom. Actually, taking 
the thermodynamic  l imit  o f N &#8594; &#8734; leads to a number of simpli&#64257;cations, some of which 
are described in this section. 
There are typically three types of N dependence encountered in the thermodynamic 
limit: 
(a) Intensive  q uantities, such as temperature T, and generalized forces, e.g. pressure P, 
and magnetic &#64257;eld B/vector, are independent of N, i.e. O(N0). 
(b) Extensive  q uantities, such as energy E, entropy S, and generalized displacements, e.g. 
volume V, and magnetization M/vector, are proportional to N, i.e. O(N1). 
(c) Exponential  d ependence, i.e. O exp(N&#966;) , is encountered in enumerating discrete 
micro-states, or computing available volumes in phase space. 
Other asymptotic dependencies are certainly not ruled out a priori. For example, the 
Coulomb energy of N ions at &#64257;xed density scales as Q2/R &#8764;N5/3 . Such dependencies 
are rarely encountered in every day physics. The Coulomb interaction of ions is quickly

Shannon&#8217;s  T heorem  p roves more rigorously that the minimum number of bits necessary 
to ensure that the percentage of errors in N trials vanishes in the N &#8594; &#8734; limit, is ln 2 g. 
For any non-uniform distribution, this is less than the N ln2 M bits needed in the absence 
of any information on relative probabilities. The di&#64256;erence per trial is thus attributed to the information content of the probability distribution, and is given by 
M 
I[{pi}] = ln 2 M + pi ln2 pi . (II.67) 
i=1 
&#8226; Entropy: E q.(II.64) is encountered frequently in statistical mechanics in the context of 
mixing M distinct components; its natural logarithm is related to the entropy  o f m ixing. 
More generally, we can de&#64257;ne an entropy  f or any probability d istribution a s 
M

i=1 
The above entropy takes a minimum value of zero for the delta&#8211;function distribution p(i) = &#948;
i,j, and a maximum value of ln M for the uniform distribution, p(i) = 1/M. S 
is thus a measure of dispersity (disorder) of the distribution, and does not depend on the values of the random variables {x
i}. A one to one mapping to fi = F(xi) leaves the 
entropy unchanged, while a many to one mapping makes the distribution more ordered and decrease S. For example, if the two values, x
1 and x2, are mapped onto the same f, 
the change in entropy is 
p1 p2&#916;S(x1, x2 f) = p1 ln + p2 ln &lt; 0. (II.69) &#8594;p1 +p2 p1 +p2 
&#8226; Estimation: The entropy S, can also be used to quantify subjective estimates of probabil&#173;
ities. In the absence of any information, the best unbiased  e stimate  i s that all M outcomes 
are equally likely. This is the distribution of maximum entropy. If additional information is available, the unbiased estimate is obtained by maximizing the entropy subject to the

In statistical mechanics we frequently encounter sums or integrals of exponential vari&#173;

There are two types of correction to the above result. Firstly, there are higher or&#173;

perturbatively, and lead to a series in powers of 1 /N. Secondly, there may be addi&#173;

/integraldisplay In a canonical ensemble, the gas density is reduced at the walls. This is because the 
particles in the middle of the box experience an attractive potential V f rom all sides, while 
at the edge only an attractive energy of V/2 is available from half of the space. The 
resulting change in density is approximately 
&#948;n &#8776; n e &#8722;&#946;V/2 &#8722;e &#8722;&#946;V &#8776; &#946;nV/2. ( V.48) 
Integrating the interaction of one particle in the bulk with the rest gives 
V = d3/vector r Vattr.(r)n = &#8722;n&#937;u0. (V.49) 
The change in density thus gives the pressure correction of &#948;P = &#8722;n2&#937;u0/2 calculated 
in eq.(V.44). There is no correction to the kinetic energy of the particles impinging on 
the wall, since in the canonical formulation the probabilites for momentum and location 
of the particles are independent variables. The probability distribution for momentum is 
uniform in space, giving the average kinetic energy of kBT/2 for each direction of motion. 
A di&#64256;erent explanation is presented in a kinetic formulation in which particles follow 
the deterministic Hamiltonian equations of motion. In this formulation, the impinging particles lose kinetic energy in approaching the wall from the surface, since they have to 
climb out of the potential well set up by the attractions of bulk particles. The reduction 
in kinetic energy is given by 
mv
2 1 /integraldisplay 1 &#948; x = d3/vector r Vattr.(r)n = &#8722; n&#937;u0. (V.50) 2 2 2 
The reduced velocities lead to an increase in the surface density in this case, as the slower 
particles spend a longer time &#964; i n the vicinity of the wall! The relative change in density 
is given by 
&#948;n &#948; &#964; &#948; v x 1&#948;vx 2

The increase in density is precisely the opposite of the result of eq.(V.48) in the canonical 
formulation. However, with the decrease in kinetic energy calculated in eq.(V.50), it again 
leads to the correct reduction in pressure.

V.D Breakdown of the van der Waals equation 
As discussed in sec.I.I, mechanical stability of a gas requires the positivity of the 
isothermal compressibility, &#954;T = &#8722;V &#8722;1 &#8706;V/&#8706;P |T. This condition can be obtained by 
examining density &#64258;uctuations in a grand canonical ensemble. The probability of &#64257;nding

e&#946;&#181;NZ(T,N,V ) p(N,V ) = . ( V.52) Q 
Since for a gas ln Q= &#8722;&#946;G = PV/k BT , eqs.(IV.103) and (IV.104) simplify to

Dividing the two equations, and using the chain rule, results in
kBT &#8706;N = V
 &#8706;P 
Th
e positivity of &#954;T is thus tied to that of the variance of N. A stable value of N 
c
orresponds to a maximum of the probability p(N,V  ) , i.e. a positive compressibility. A 
negative &#954;T actually corresponds to a minimum inp(N,V ) implying that the system is least 
likely to be found at such densities. Fluctuations in density will then occur spontaneously 
and change the density to a stable value. 
Any approximate equation of state, such as the van der Waals equation, must at 
least satisfy the stability requirements. However, the van der Waals isotherms contain a portion with &#8722; &#8706;P/&#8706;V  |
T &lt; 0, for temperatures less than a critical value Tc. The negative 
compressibility implies an instability towards forming domains of lower and higher density, i.e. phase separation. The attractive interactions in real gases do indeed result in a liquid&#8211; 
gas phase separation at low temperatures. The isotherms then include a &#64258;at portion, 
&#8706;P/&#8706;V  |
T = 0, at the coexistence of the two phases. Can the (unstable) van der Waals 
isotherms be used to construct the phase diagram of a real gas? 
One way of doing so is by the following Maxwell construction : The variations of the 
chemical potential &#181;(T,P ) , along an isotherm are obtained by integrating eq.(V.53), as &#65533;N2&#65533;c kBT &#8706;N &#8706; V

Remarkably, the uniform density approximation reproduces the van der Waals equa&#173;
tion of state. However, the self-consistency of this approximation can now be checked. 
As long as &#954;T is positive, eq.(V.54) implies that the variance of density vanishes for large 
volumes as /angbracketleftbig 
n2/angbracketrightbig 
= kBTn2&#954;T/V . But &#954;T diverges at Tc, and at lower temperatures its c 
negativity implies an instability towards density &#64258;uctuations as discussed in the previous section. When condensation occurs, there is phase separation into high (liquid) and low (gas) density states, and the uniform density assumption becomes manifestly incorrect. 
This di&#64259;culty is circumvented in the grand canonical ensemble. Once the chemical poten&#173;
tial is &#64257;xed, the number of particles (and hence density) in this ensemble is automatically 
adjusted to that of the appropriate phase. 
As the assumption of a uniform density is correct for both the liquid and gas phases, 
we can use the approximations of eqs.(V.59) and (V.60) to estimate the grand partition function

          <text>V.C The Second Virial Coe&#64259;cient &amp; van der Waals Equation 
Let us study the second virial coe&#64259;cient B2, for a typical gas using eq.(V.33). As 
discussed before, the two-body potential is characterized by a hard core repulsion at short 
distances and a van der Waals attraction at large distances. To make the computations 
easier, we shall use the following approximation for the potential, 
&#63729; 
+&#8734; for r&lt;r 0 &#63730; 
V(r) = , ( V.37) &#63731; &#8722;u0 (r0/r)6 for r&gt;r 0 
which combines both features. The contributions of the two portions can then be calculated 
separately as,

The second integrand can be approximated by &#946;u0(r0/r)6 in the high temperature limit,

B2(T ) = 1 &#8722; . ( V.40) 2 kBT 
&#8226; Remarks and observations: 
(1) The tail of the van der Waals attractive potential ( &#8733; r&#8722;6) extends to very long sep&#173;
arations. Yet, its integral in eq.(V.39) is dominated by contributions from the short 
scales r0. In this limited context, the van der Waals potential is short-ranged , and 
results in corrections to the ideal gas behavior that are analytical in density n, leading 
to the virial series. 
(2) By contrast, potentials that fall o&#64256; with separation as 1 /r3 or slower, are long-ranged. 
The integral appearing in calculation of the second virial coe&#64259;cient is dominated by long distances, and is divergent. As a result, corrections to the ideal gas behavior can

          <slideno>1</slideno>
          <text>not be written in the form of a virial series, and are in fact non-analytic . A good 
example is provided by the Coulomb interactions (see problems for the test), where 
the non-analytic corrections can be obtained by summing all the ring diagrams in the 
cumulant (or cluster) expansions. 
(3) The second virial coe&#64259;cient has dimensions of volume, and (for short-range potentials) is proportional to the atomic volume &#937;. In the high temperature limit, the importance of corrections to ideal gas behavior can be estimated by comparing the &#64257;rst two terms 
of eq.(V.14), 
B
2n2 B2 Atomic volume gas density 
n = n&#8722;1 &#8764; volume per particle in gas &#8764; liquid density . (V.41) 
This ratio is roughly 10&#8722;3 for air at room temperature and pressure. The corrections 
to ideal gas behavior are thus small at low densities. On dimensional grounds, a similar 
ratio is expected for the higher order terms, B&#8467;n&#8467;/B&#8467;&#8722;1n&#8467;&#8722;1, in the virial series. We 
may thus suspect the convergence of the series at high enough densities (when the gas 
liqui&#64257;es). 
(4) The virial expansion breaks down not only at high densities, but also at low temper&#173;
atures. This is suggested by the divergences in eqs.(V.40) and (V.38) as T &#8594; 0 , and 
re&#64258;ects the fact that in the presence of attractive interactions the particles can lower 
their energy at low temperatures by condensing into a liquid state.

          <text>/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright  Since the van der Waals isotherms for T &lt; T c are non-monotonic, there is a range of 
pressures that correspond to three di&#64256;erent values, {&#181;&#945;}, of the chemical potential. The 
possibility of several values of &#181; a t a given temperature and pressure indicates phase 
coexistence. In equilibrium, the number of particles in each phase N&#945;, adjusts so as 
to minimize the Gibbs free energy G = /summationtext 
&#945; &#181;&#945;N&#945;. Clearly, the phase with lowest &#181;&#945; 
will acquire all the particles. A phase transition occurs when two branches of allowed 
chemical potentials intersect. From eq.(V.55), the critical pressure Pc, for this intersection 
is obtained from the condition 
/contintegraldisplay Pc 
dP &#8242; V (T,P &#8242; ) = 0. ( V.56) 
Pc 
A geometrical interpretation of the above result is that Pc corresponds to a pressure that 
encloses equal areas of the non-monotonic isotherm on each side. The Maxwell construction 
approach to phase condensation is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it relies on integrating a 
clearly unphysical portion the van der Waals isotherm. A better approach that makes the approximations involved more apparent is presented in the next section. 
V.E Mean Field Theory of Condensation 
In principle, all properties of the interacting system, including phase separation, 
are contained within the thermodynamic potentials that can be obtained by evaluating Z(T,N) or Q(T,&#181;). Phase transitions, however, are characterized by discontinuities in 
various state functions and must correspond to the appearance of singularities in the par&#173;tition functions. At &#64257;rst glance, it is somewhat surprising that any singular behavior should emerge from computing such well behaved integrals (for short-ranged interactions) as &#63726; &#63737; /integraldisplay/producttext

Instead of evaluating the integrals perturbatively, we shall now set up a reasonable ap&#173;proximation scheme. The contributions of the hard core and attractive portions of the potential are again treated separately, and the partition function approximated by

/parenleftBig /parenrightBig /parenleftBig /parenrightBig gases, towards the end of the19th century. At that time the microscopic interactions 
between gas particles were not known, and van der Waals postulated the necessity of an 
attractive interaction between gas atoms based on the observed decreases in pressure. It 
was only later on that such interactions were observed directly, and then attributed to the 
induced dipole&#8211;dipole forces by London. The physical justi&#64257;cation of the correction terms 
is as follows. 
(a) There is a correction to the gas volume V d ue to the hard core exclusions. At &#64257;rst sight, 
it may appear surprising that the excluded volume b, in eq.(V.44) is one half of the volume 
that is excluded around each particle. This is because this factor measures a jointexcluded 
volume involving all particles in phase space. In fact, the contribution of coordinates to the partition function of the hard-core gas can be estimated at low densities , from 
/integraldisplay

(V.45) 
The above result is obtained by adding particles one at a time, and noting that the available volume for the m
th particle is ( V &#8722;m&#937;) . At low densities, the overall e&#64256;ect is a reduction 
of the volume available to each particle by approximately &#937; /2. Of course, the above result 
is only approximate, since the e&#64256;ects of excluded volume involving more than two particles 
are not correctly taken into account. The relatively simple form of eq.(V.45) is only exact 
at for spatial dimensions d = 1 and in&#64257;nity. As proved in problems for the test, the exact 
excluded volume in d = 1 is in fact &#937;. 
(b) The decrease in pressure P , due to attractive interactions, is somewhat harder to 
quantify. In sec.III.F, the gas pressure was related to the impacts of particles on a wall via 
P = (nvx)(2mvx)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle = nmvx2 , (V.46) 
vx&lt;0 
where the &#64257;rst term is the number of collisions per unit time and area, while the second is 
the momentum imparted by each particle. For the ideal gas, the usual equation of state 
is recovered by noting that the average kinetic energy is mvx2/2 = kBT/2. Attractive 
interactions lead to a reduction in pressure given by 
&#948;P = &#948; n m v2 + n&#948; m v2 . (V.47) x x 
While di&#64256;erent statistical ensembles give the same pressure, which is a bulk state function, they may lead to di&#64256;erent behaviors at the surface. We must thus be careful, and consistent, 
in evaluation of eq.(V.47), which depends of surface properties.

&#945; 
i.e. the grand canonical and canonical values of pressure are identical at a particular 
density. However, if eq.(V.67) admits multiple solutions for the density at a particular 
chemical potential, the correct density is uniquely determined as the one that maximizes 
the canonical expression for pressure (or for &#968;(n)). 
The mechanism for the liquid&#8211;gas phase transition is therefore the following. The 
sum in eq.(V.63) is dominated by two large terms at the liquid and gas densities. At 
a particular chemical potential, the stable phase is determined by the larger of the two terms. The phase transition occurs when the dominant term changes upon varying the 
temperature. In mathematical form

/contintegraltext of &#175;dQ is not speci&#64257;ed, the Carnot engine must operate a series of in&#64257;nitesimal cycles in 
either direction. To deliver heat &#175;dQ to the system at some stage, the engine has to extract 
heat &#175;dQR from the &#64257;xed reservoir. If the heat is delivered to a part of the system which is 
locally at a temperature T, then according to eq.(I.22), 
dQ &#175;dQR = . (I.23) &#175; T0 T 
After the cycle in completed, the system and the Carnot Engine return to their original 
states. The net e&#64256;ect of the combined process is extracting heat QR =&#175;dQR from the 
reservoir and converting it to external work W. The work W = QR is the sum total of the 
work elements done by the Carnot engine, and the work performed by the system in the 
complete cycle. By Kelvin&#8217;s statement of the second law, QR = W &#8804; 0, i.e. 
dQ &#175; &#175;dQ T0 &#8804; 0, =&#8658; &#8804; 0, (I.24) T T 
since T0 &gt; 0. Note that T in eq.(I.24) refers to the temperature of the whole system 
only for quasi-static processes in which it can be uniquely de&#64257;ned throughout the cycle. Otherwise, it is just a local temperature (say at a boundary of the system) at which the Carnot engine deposits the element of heat. 
Consequences of Clausius&#8217;s theorem: 
(1) For a reversible cycle dQ
rev = 0, since by running the cycle in the opposite &#175;/T 
direction &#8594; &#8722;&#175;, and by the above theorem &#175;/T is both non-negative and dQ&#175;rev dQrev dQrev
non-positive, hence zero. This result implies that the integral of &#175;/T between any two dQrev
points A and B is independent of path, since for two paths (1) and (2) 
/integraldisplay B (1) /integraldisplay A (2) /integraldisplay B (1) /integraldisplay B (2) dQ dQ dQ dQ&#175;rev &#175;rev &#175;rev &#175;rev + = 0, =&#8658; = . (I.25) 
A T1 B T2 A T1 A T2 
(2) Using eq.(I.25) we can construct yet another function of state, the entropy  S. Since 
th
e integral is independent of path, and only depends on the two end points, we can set 
/integraldisplay B &#175;dQrev S(B)&#8722;S(A)&#8801; . (I.26) TA 
For reversible processes, we can now compute the heat from &#175; = TdS. This allows us dQrev 
to construct adiabatic curves for a general (multi-variable) system from the condition of constant S. Note that eq.(I.26) only de&#64257;nes the entropy up to an overall constant.

          <text>dumping QC at TC. The combined system takes QH &#8722; Q from TH, produces work 
equal to QH &#8722;QC and dumps QC &#8722;Qat TC. If we adjust the engine output such that 
QC = Q, the net result is a 100% e&#64259;cient engine, in violation of Kelvin&#8217;s statement. 
(b) Alternatively, assume a machine that violates Kelvin&#8217;s law by taking heat Q and 
converting it completely to work. The work output of this machine can be used to 
run a refrigerator, with the net outcome of transferring heat from a colder to a hotter 
body, in violation of Clausius&#8217;s statement. 
Although these statements may appear as rather trivial and qualitative descriptions, 
they have important quantitative implications as demonstrated in the next sections. 
I.E Carnot Engines &amp; Thermodynamic Temperature 
&#8226; A Carnot Engine is any engine that is r eversible, runs in a cycle, with all of its heat 
exchanges taking place at a source temperature TH, and a sink temperature TC. 
A reversible  process is one that can be run backward in time by simply reversing its 
in
puts and outputs. It is the thermodynamic equivalent of frictionless motion in mechanics. 
Since time reversibility implies equilibrium, a reversible transformation must be quasi-static, but the reverse is not necessarily true (e.g., if there is energy dissipation due to 
friction). An engine that runs in a cycle  returns to its original internal state at the end of 
th 
e process. The distinguishing characteristic of the Carnot engine is that heat exchanges 
with the surroundings are carried out only at two temperatures. The zeroth law allows us 
to select two isotherms at temperatures TH and TC for these heat exchanges. To complete 
the Carnot cycle we have to connect these isotherms by reversible adiabatic paths in the 
co
ordinate space. Since heat is not a function of state, we don&#8217;t know how to construct 
such paths in general. Fortunately, we have su&#64259;cient information at this point to construct 
a Carnot engine using an ideal gas as its internal working substance. For the purpose of 
demonstration, let us compute the adiabatic curves for a monatomic ideal gas with an internal energy

Q3 = Q1 &#8722;W13 = Q2[1&#8722;&#951;(T1, T3)]. 
Comparison of the &#64257;nal two expressions yields 
[1&#8722;&#951;(T1, T3)] = [1 &#8722;&#951;(T1, T2)][1&#8722;&#951;(T2, T3)]. (I.21) 
This property implies that 1 &#8722;&#951;(T1, T2) can be written as a ratio of the form f(T2)/f(T1), 
which by convention is set to T2/T1, i.e. 
Q2 T21&#8722;&#951;(T1, T2) = &#8801; ,Q1 T1 (I.22) TH &#8722;TC =&#8658; &#951;(TH, TC) = . TH 
Eq.(I.22) de&#64257;nes temperature up to a constant of proportionality, which is again set by 
choosing the triple point of water, ice, and steam to 273.160K. Throughout this chapter, 
I have used the symbols &#920; and T interchangeably. In fact, by running a Carnot cycle 
for a perfect gas, it can be proved (see test 1 review problems) that the ideal gas and 
thermodynamic temperature scales are equivalent. Clearly the thermodynamic scale is not 
useful from a practical stand-point; its advantage is conceptual, in that it is independent 
of the properties of any substance. All thermodynamic temperatures are positive, since 
according to eq.(I.22) the heat extracted from a temperature T is proportional to it. If a 
negative temperature existed, an engine operating between it and a positive temperature would extract heat from both reservoirs and convert the sum total to work, in violation of Kelvin&#8217;s statement of the second law. 
I.F Entropy 
The following theorem allows us to construct another function of state using the second 
law. 
&#8226; Clausius&#8217;s Theorem: For any cyclic transformation (reversible or not), dQ/T &#8804; 0, &#175;
where &#175; . dQ refers to the heat increment supplied to the system at temperature T
Proof: We can subdivide the cycle into a series of in&#64257;nitesimal transformations in which 
the system receives energy in the form of heat &#175; dW. The system need not be dQ and work &#175;
in equilibrium at each interval. Direct all the heat exchanges of the system to one port 
of a Carnot engine, which has another reservoir at a &#64257;xed temperature T0. Since the sign

B to A along a reversible path. Then

In di&#64256;erential form, this implies that dS &#8805; &#175;dQ/T for any transformation. In particular, 
consider adiabatically isolating a number of subsystems, each initially separately in equi&#173;
librium. As they come to a state of joint equilibrium, since the net dQ &#175;= 0, we must have 
&#948;S &#8805; 0. Thus an adiabatic system attains a maximum value of entropy in equilibrium since 
spontaneous internal changes can only increase S. The direction of increasing entropy thus 
points out the arrow of time, and the path to equilibrium. (4)For a reversible (hence quasi-static) transformation, &#175;= dW = 
i Jidxi, dQ TdS and &#175;
and the &#64257;rst law implies 
dE = dQ+dW = TdS + Jidxi . (I.28) &#175; &#175;
i 
Although eq.(I.28) was obtained from a reversible transformation, as a relation between functions of state it is a generally valid identity of thermodynamics. Also note that in this 
equation S and T appear as conjugate variables, with S playing the role of a displacement, 
and T as the corresponding force. 
(5)The number of independent variables  necessary to describe a thermodynamic system 
al 
so follows from eq.(I.28). If there are n methods of doing work on a system, represented 
by n conjugate pairs ( Ji, xi), then n+1 independent coordinates are necessary to describe 
the system. (We shall ignore possible constraints between the mechanical coordinates.) 
For example, choosing ( E,{xi}) as coordinates, it follows from eq.(I.28) that 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle 1 &#8706;S /vextendsingle Ji /vextendsingle = , and /vextendsingle = &#8722; . (I.29) &#8706;E x T &#8706;x i /vextendsingle

          <text>with &#947; = 5/3. The adiabatic curves are clearly distinct from the isotherms, and we can 
select two such curves to intersect our isotherms, thereby completing a Carnot cycle. The 
assumption of E &#8733; T is not necessary, and in the test 1 review problems you will construct 
adiabatics for any E(T). In fact, a similar construction is possible for any two parameter 
system with E(J, x). 
&#8226; Carnot&#8217;s Theorem: No engine operating between two reservoirs (at temperatures TH 
and TC) is more e&#64259;cient than a Carnot engine operating between them. 
Proof: Since a Carnot engine is reversible, it can be run backward as a refrigerator. 
Use the non-Carnot engine to run the Carnot engine backward. Let us denote the heat exchanges of the non-Carnot and Carnot engines by Q
H, QC, and Q&#8242; 
C, respectively. H, Q&#8242; 
The net e&#64256;ect of the two engines is to transfer heat equal to QH &#8722;Q&#8242; QC &#8722;Q&#8242; from H = C 
TH to TC. According to Clausius&#8217;s statement, the quantity of transferred heat cannot be 
negative, i.e. QH &#8805; Q&#8242; Since the same quantity of work W, is involved in this process, H. 
we conclude that 
W W &#8804; , =&#8658; &#951;Carnot &#8805; &#951;non&#8722;Carnot. (I.20) QH QH &#8242; 
Corollary: All reversible (Carnot) engines have the same universal e&#64259;ciency &#951;(TH, TC), 
since each can be used to run the other one backward. 
The Thermodynamic  Temperature  Scale: As shown earlier, it is at least theoretically 
po
ssible to construct a Carnot engine using an ideal gas (or any other two parameter 
system) as working substance. We now &#64257;nd that independent of the material used, and 
design and construction, all such cyclic and reversible engines have the same maximum theoretical e&#64259;ciency. Since this maximum e&#64259;ciency is only dependent on the two tem&#173;peratures, it can be used to construct a temperature scale. Such a temperature scale has the attractive property of being independent of the properties of any material (e.g. the ideal gas). To construct such a scale we &#64257;rst &#64257;nd out how &#951;(T
H, TC) depends on the two 
temperatures. Consider two Carnot engines running in series, one between temperatures T
1 and T2, and the other between T2 and T3 (T1 &gt; T2 &gt; T3). Denote the heat exchanges, 
and work outputs, of the two engines by Q1, Q2, W12, and Q2, Q3, W23 respectively. Note 
that the heat dumped by the &#64257;rst engine is taken in by the second, so that the combined e&#64256;ect is another Carnot engine (since each component is reversible) with heat exchanges Q
1, Q3, and work output W13 = W12 +W23. The three heats are related by 
Q2 = Q1 &#8722;W12 = Q1[1&#8722;&#951;(T1, T2)],

          <text>I.D The Second Law 
The historical development of thermodynamics follows the industrial revolution in the 
19th century, and the advent of heat engines. It is interesting to see how such practical 
considerations as the e&#64259;ciency of engines can lead to abstract ideas like entropy. 
An idealized heat engine wo rks by taking in a certain amount of heat QH, from a 
heat source (for example a coal &#64257;re), converting a portion of it to work W, and dumping 
the remaining heat QC into a heat sink (e.g. atmosphere). The e&#64259;ciency of the engine is 
calculated from 
W Q H &#8722;QC&#951; = = &#8804; 1. (I.16) QH QH 
An idealized refrigerator  is like an engine running backward, i.e. using work W to 
e
xtract heat QC from a cold system, and dumping heat QH at a higher temperature. We 
can similarly de&#64257;ne a &#64257;gure of merit for the performance of a refrigerator as 
QC QC&#969; = = . (I.17) W Q H &#8722;QC 
The &#64257;rst law rules out so called &#8216;perpetual motion machines of the &#64257;rst kind&#8217;, i.e. 
engines that produce work without consuming any energy. However, the conservation of 
energy is not violated by an engine that produces work by converting water to ice. Such 
a &#8216;perpetual motion machine of the second kind&#8217; would certainly solve the world&#8217;s energy problems, but is ruled out by the second law of thermodynamics. The observation that the natural direction for the &#64258;ow of heat is from hotter to colder bodies is the content of the second law of thermodynamics. There are a number of di&#64256;erent formulations of the 
second law, such as the following two statements. 
&#8226; Kelvin&#8217;s Statement: No process is possible whose sole result is the complete conversion 
of heat into work. &#8226; Clausius&#8217;s Statement: No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat 
from a colder to a hotter body. 
A perfect engine is ruled out by the &#64257;rst statement, a perfect refrigerator by the 
second. In fact the two statements are equivalent as shown below. Proof of the equivalence of the Kelvin and Clausius statements proceeds by showing that 
if one is violated so is the other. 
(a) Let us assume that there is a machine that violates Clausius&#8217;s statement by taking heat Q from a cooler temperature T
C to a higher temperature TH. Now consider 
an engine operating between these two temperature, taking heat QH from TH and

          <text>/parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg I.I Stability Conditions 
The conditions derived in section I.G are similar to the well known requirements for 
mechanical stability. A particle moving in an external potential U settles to a stable 
equilibrium at a minimum value of U. In addition to the vanishing of the force &#8722;U&#8242; , this 
is a consequence of the loss of energy to frictional processes. Stable equilibrium occurs at 
a minimum of the potential energy. For a thermodynamic system, equilibrium occurs at 
the extremum of the appropriate potential, for example at the maximum value of entropy 
for an isolated system. The requirement that spontaneous changes should always lead 
to an increased entropy, places important constraints on equilibrium response functions, 
discussed in this section. 
Consider a homogeneous system at equilibrium, characterized by intensive state func&#173;
tions ( T,J, &#181;), and extensive variables ( E,x,N). Now imagine that the system is arbitrar&#173;
ily divided into two equal parts, and that one part spontaneously transfers some energy 
to the other part in the form of work or heat. The two subsystems, A and B, initially 
have the same values for the intensive variables, while their extensive coordinates satisfy 
EA + EB = E, xA + xB = x, and NA + NB = N. After the exchange of energy between 
the two subsystems, the coordinates of A change to 
(EA +&#948;E, xA + &#948;x, NA +&#948;N), and (TA + &#948;TA, JA +&#948;JA, &#181;A + &#948;&#181;A), (I.60) 
and those of B to 
(EB &#8722;&#948;E, xB &#8722;&#948;x, NB &#8722;&#948;N), and (TB + &#948;TB, JB + &#948;JB, &#181;B +&#948;&#181;B). (I.61) 
Note that the overall system is maintained at constant E, x, and N. Since the inten&#173;
sive variables are themselves functions of the extensive coordinates, to &#64257;rst order in the 
variations of ( E,x,N), we have 
&#948;TA = &#8722;&#948;TB &#8801; &#948;T, &#948; JA = &#8722;&#948;JB &#8801; &#948;J, &#948;&#181; A = &#8722;&#948;&#181;B &#8801; &#948;&#181;. (I.62) 
Using eq.(I.48), the entropy of the system can be written as 
EA JA &#181;A EB JB &#181;BS = SA + SB = &#8722; &#183; xA &#8722; &#183; NA + &#8722; &#183; xB &#8722; &#183; NB . (I.63) TA TA TA TB TB TB

/vextendsingle /vextendsingle I.J The Third Law 
Di&#64256;erences in entropy between two states can be computed using the second law, 
from &#916;S =&#175;/T. Low temperature experiments indicate that &#916; S(X, T) vanishes as dQrev
T goes to zero for any set of coordinates X. This observation is independent of the other 
laws of thermodynamics, leading to the formulation of a third law by Nernst, which states 
&#8226; The entropy of all systems at zero absolute temperature is a universal constant that can 
be taken to be zero. 
The above statement actually implies that 
lim S(X, T) = 0, (I.73) 
T&#8594;0 
which is a stronger requirement than the vanishing of the di&#64256;erences &#916; S(X, T). This 
extended condition has been tested for metastable phases of a substance. Certain materials 
such as sulphur or phosphine can exist in a number of rather similar crystalline structures (allotropes). Of course, at a given temperature only one of these structures is truly stable. 
Let us imagine that as the high temperature equilibrium phase A, is cooled slowly, it makes 
a transition at a temperature T
&#8727; to phase B, releasing latent heat L. Under more rapid 
cooling conditions the transition is avoided, and phase Apersists in metastable equilibrium. 
The entropies in the two phases can be calculated by measuring the heat capacities CA(T) 
and CB(T). Starting from T = 0, the entropy at a temperature slightly above T&#8727; can be 
computed along the two possible paths as 
&#8727; &#8727; /integraldisplay T /integraldisplay TCA(T&#8242; ) CB(T&#8242; ) L&#8727; &#8242; &#8242; S(T+&#491;) = SA(0) + dT T&#8242; = SB(0) + dT T&#8242; + T&#8727; . (I.74) 
0 0 
Such measurements have indeed veri&#64257;ed that SA(0) = SB(0)&#8801; 0. 
Consequences of the third law: 
(1)Since S(T = 0,X) = 0 for all coordinates X, 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle 
lim = 0 . (I.75) 
T&#8594;0 &#8706;X T 
(2)Heat capacities must vanish as T &#8594; 0 since

          <text>of the third law can be observed. Another de&#64257;ciency of the law is its inapplicability to 
glassy phases. Glasses results from the freezing of supercooled liquids into con&#64257;gurations with extremely slow dynamics. While not truly equilibrium phases (and hence subject to 
all the laws of thermodynamics), they are e&#64256;ectively so due to the slowness of the dynam&#173;
ics. A possible test of the applicability of the third law to glasses, is discussed in test #1 
review problems.

The condition for stable equilibrium is that any change should lead to a decrease in entropy, 
and hence we must have 
&#948;T&#948;S + &#948;J&#183; &#948;x + &#948;&#181;&#183; &#948;N &#8805; 0. (I.66) 
We have now removed the subscript A, as the above condition must apply to the whole 
system as well as to any part of it. 
The above condition was obtained assuming that the overall system was kept at con&#173;
stant E, x, and N. In fact, since all coordinates appear symmetrically in this expression, 
the same result is obtained for any other set of constraints. For example, variations in &#948;T 
and &#948;x with &#948;N = 0, lead to 
&#63729; 
&#63732; &#8706;S /vextendsingle &#8706;S /vextendsingle &#63732; &#63732; &#948;S = &#948;T + &#948;xi &#63730; &#8706;T /vextendsingle &#8706;xi /vextendsingle x /vextendsingle T . (I.67) &#63732; &#8706;Ji/vextendsingle &#8706;Ji /vextendsingle &#63732; &#63732; &#948;Ji = &#948;T + &#948;xj &#63731; &#8706;T x &#8706;xjT 
Substituting these variations into eq.(I.66) leads to 
&#8706;S /vextendsingle &#8706;Ji /vextendsingle /vextendsingle (&#948;T)2 + /vextendsingle &#948;xi&#948;xj &#8805; 0. (I.68) &#8706;T x &#8706;xjT 
Note that the cross terms proportional to &#948;T&#948;x i cancel due to the Maxwell relation in 
eq.(I.56). Eq.(I.68) is a quadratic from , and must be positive for all choices of &#948;T and &#948;x. 
The resulting constraints on the coe&#64259;cients are independent of how the system was initially 
partitioned into subsystems A and B, and represent the conditions for stable equilibrium.

The second equality follows from the Maxwell relation in eq.(I.56). The vanishing of the 
latter is guaranteed by eq.(I.75). (4)It is impossible to cool any system to absolute zero temperature in a &#64257;nite number of 
steps. For example, we can cool a gas by an adiabatic reduction in pressure. Since the curves of S versus T for di&#64256;erent pressures must join at T = 0, successive steps involve 
progressively smaller changes, in S and in T, on approaching zero temperature. Alterna&#173;
tively, the unattainability of zero temperatures implies that S(T = 0, P) is independent 
of P. This is a weaker statement of the third law which also implies the equality of zero 
temperature entropy for di&#64256;erent substances. 
In the following sections, we shall attempt to justify the laws of thermodynamics from 
a microscopic point of view. The &#64257;rst law is clearly a re&#64258;ection of the conservation of energy, which also operates at the microscopic level. The zeroth and second laws suggest an irreversible approach to equilibrium, a concept that has no analog at the particulate level. It is justi&#64257;ed as re&#64258;ecting the collective behavior of large numbers of degrees of freedom. In statistical mechanics the entropy is calculated as S = k
B lng, where g is the 
degeneracy of the states (number of con&#64257;gurations with the same energy). The third law of thermodynamics thus requires that g = 1 at T = 0, i.e. that the ground state of any 
system is unique. This condition does not hold within the framework of classical statisti&#173;
cal mechanics, as there are examples of both non-interacting (such as an ideal gas), and interacting (the frustrated spins in a triangular antiferromagnet) systems with degenerate ground states, and a &#64257;nite zero temperature entropy. However, classical mechanics is inap&#173;plicable at very low temperatures and energies where quantum e&#64256;ects become important. The third law is then equivalent to the statement that the ground state of a quantum mechanical system is unique. While this can be proved for a non-interacting system, there is no general proof of its validity with interactions. Unfortunately, the onset of quantum e&#64256;ects (and other possible origins of the breaking of classical degeneracy) are system spe&#173;ci&#64257;c. Hence it is not a priori clear how low the temperature must be, before the predictions

If only one of the &#948;xi in eq.(I.66) is non-zero, the corresponding response function 
&#8706;xi/&#8706;Ji|T,xj/negationslashmust be positive. However, a more general requirement exists since all &#948;x

values may be chosen non-zero. The general requirement is that the matrix of coe&#64259;cients 
&#8706;Ji/&#8706;xj|T must be positive de&#64257;nite . A matrix is positive de&#64257;nite if all of its eigenvalues 
are positive. It is necessary, but not su&#64259;cient, that all the diagonal elements of such a 
matrix (the inverse response functions) be positive, leading to further constraints between the response functions. Including chemical work for a gas, the appropriate matrix is

critical point of the gas from mean-&#64257;eld approximations to the isotherms (such as the van

&#65533;
/angbracketleftbigg /angbracketrightbigg
 /angbracketleftbigg /angbracketrightbigg As discussed earlier, for elastic collisions, there are 5 conserved quantities: particle 
number, the three components of momentum, and kinetic energy. Each leads to a corre&#173;
sponding hydrodynamic equation, as constructed below: 
(a)Particle number: Setting &#967; = 1 in eq.(III.79) leads to 
&#8706;tn + &#8706;&#945; (nu&#945;) = 0, (III.80) 
where we have introduced the local velocity 
p &#65533;&#65533; u &#8801; . (III.81) m 
This equation simply states that the time variation of the local particle density is due to a particle current J&#65533;
n = n&#65533; u. 
(b)Momentum: Any linear function of the momentum p &#65533;is conserved in the collision, and 
we shall explore the consequences of the conservation of 
&#65533; c &#8801; p &#8722;&#65533; u. (III.82) m 
Substituting c&#945; into eq.(III.79) leads to 
F&#945;&#8706;&#946; (n&#65533;(u&#946; + c&#946;)c&#945;&#65533;) +n&#8706;tu&#945; +n&#8706;&#946;u&#945; &#65533;u&#946; +c&#946;&#65533; &#8722;n = 0. (III.83) m 
Taking advantage of &#65533;c&#945;&#65533; = 0, from eqs.(III.81) and (III.82), leads to 
F&#945; 1 &#8706;tu&#945; + u&#946;&#8706;&#946;u&#945; = &#8722; &#8706;&#946;P&#945;&#946; , (III.84) m mn 
where we have introduced the pressure tensor , 
P&#945;&#946; &#8801; mn&#65533;c&#945;c&#946;&#65533;. (III.85) 
The left hand side of the equation is the acceleration of an element of the &#64258;uid d&#65533; u/dt, 
which should equal F&#65533;net/m according to Newton&#8217;s equation. The net force includes an 
additional component due to the variations in the pressure tensor across the &#64258;uid. (c)Kinetic energy: We &#64257;rst introduce an average local kinetic energy

&#949; &#8801; mc= p&#8722;p &#65533;&#183; &#65533; u + mu, (III.86) 2 2 m 2

/parenleftbigg
 /angbracketleftbigg /angbracketrightbigg/parenrightbigg and then examine the conservation law obtained by setting &#967; equal to mc2/2 in eq.(III.79). 
Since for space and time derivatives &#8706;&#949; = mc&#946;&#8706;c&#946; = &#8722;mc&#946;&#8706;u&#946;, we obtain 
2mc&#8706;t(n&#949;)+&#8706;&#945; n (u&#945; + c&#945;) + nm&#8706; tu&#946; &#65533;c&#946;&#65533;+nm&#8706; &#945;u&#946; &#65533;(u&#945; + c&#945;)c&#946;&#65533;&#8722;nF&#945; &#65533;c&#945;&#65533; = 0. 2 
(III.87) 
Taking advantage of &#65533;c&#945;&#65533; = 0, the above equation is simpli&#64257;ed to 
2mc&#8706;t(n&#949;) +&#8706;&#945; (nu&#945;&#949;) +&#8706;&#945; n c &#945; +P&#945;&#946;&#8706;&#945;u&#946; = 0. (III.88) 2 
We next take out the dependence on n in the &#64257;rst two terms of the above equation, &#64257;nding 
&#949;&#8706;tn +n&#8706;t&#949;+&#949;&#8706;&#945; (nu&#945;) +nu&#945;&#8706;&#945;&#949;+ &#8706;&#945;h&#945; +P&#945;&#946;u&#945;&#946; = 0, (III.89) 
where we have also introduced the local heat &#64258;ux 
&#65533;h &#8801; nm /angbracketleftbig 
c&#945;c 2/angbracketrightbig 
, (III.90) 2 
and the rate of strain tensor 
1 u&#945;&#946; = (&#8706;&#945;u&#946; + &#8706;&#946;u&#945;). (III.91) 2 
Eliminating the &#64257;rst and third terms in eq.(III.89) with the aid of eq.(III.80) leads to 
1 1 &#8706;t&#949;+ u&#945;&#8706;&#945;&#949; = &#8722; &#8706;&#945;h&#945; &#8722; P&#945;&#946;u&#945;&#946;. (III.92) n n 
Clearly to solve the hydrodynamic equations for n, &#65533; u, and &#949;, we need expressions for P&#945;&#946; 
and &#65533;h, which are either given phenomenologically, or calculated from the density f1, as in 
the next sections.

/integraldisplay III.G Conservation Laws 
&#8226; Approach to equilibrium: We now address the third question posed in the introduction, 
of how the gas reaches its &#64257;nal equilibrium. Consider a situation in which the gas is 
perturbed from the equilibrium form described by eq.(III.56), and follow its relaxation to 
equilibrium. There is a hierarchy of mechanisms that operate at di&#64256;erent time scales. 
(i) The fastest processes are the two body collisions of particles in immediate vicinity. Over a time scale of the order of &#964;
c, f2(&#65533; q1,&#65533; q2, t) relaxes to f1(q &#65533;1, t)f1(&#65533; q2, t) for separa&#173;
tions |&#65533; q1 &#8722;&#65533; q2| &#8811;d. Similar relaxations occur for the higher order densities fs. 
(ii) At the next stage, f1 relaxes to a local equilibrium from, as in eq.(III.53), over the 
time scale of the mean free time &#964;&#215;. This is the intrinsic scale set by the collision term 
on the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation. After this time interval, quantities conserved in collisions achieve a state of local equilibrium. We can then de&#64257;ne at each point a (time dependent) local density by integrating over all momenta as 
n(&#65533; q, t) = pf
1(&#65533; q, t) , (III.69) d3&#65533; p,&#65533;
as well as a local expectation value for any operator O(&#65533; q, t)p,&#65533;
1 &#65533;O(&#65533; q, t)&#65533;= pf1(&#65533; q, t)O(&#65533; q, t) . d3&#65533; p,&#65533; p,&#65533; (III.70) n(&#65533;q, t) 
(iii) After the densities and expectation values have relaxed to their local equilibrium forms 
in the intrinsic time scales &#964;c and &#964;&#215;, there is a subsequent slower relaxation to global 
equilibrium over extrinsic time and length scales. This &#64257;nal stage is governed by the smaller streaming terms on the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation. It is most conveniently expressed in terms of the time evolution of conserved quantities according to hydrodynamic equations . 
Conserved quantities are left unchanged by the two body collisions, i.e. satisfy 
&#967;(p &#65533;
1,&#65533; q, t) + &#967;(p &#65533;2,&#65533; q, t) = &#967;(p &#65533;1 &#8242; ,&#65533; q, t) + &#967;(p &#65533;2 &#8242; ,&#65533; q, t), (III.71) 
where ( p &#65533;1, &#65533; p2) and ( p &#65533;1 &#8242; , &#65533; p2 &#8242; ) refer to the momenta before and after a collision, respectively. 
For such quantities, we have 
/integraldisplay /vextendsingle 
J&#967;(&#65533; q, t) = d3&#65533; p &#967;(&#65533; p,&#65533; q, t) d f1

(The implicit arguments ( &#65533;q, t) are left out for ease of notation.) We now perform the same 
set of changes of variables that were used in the proof of the H-theorem. The &#64257;rst step is 
averaging after exchange of the dummy variables p &#65533;1 and p &#65533;2, leading to 
J&#967; = &#8722; 1 d3p &#65533;1d3p &#65533;2d2&#65533;b|&#65533; v1 &#8722;&#65533; v2|[f1(p &#65533;1)f1(p &#65533;2)&#8722;f1(p &#65533;1 &#8242; )f1(p &#65533;2 &#8242; )][&#967;(p &#65533;1) +&#967;(p &#65533;2)]. (III.74) 2 
&#8242; Next, change variables from the originators (p &#65533; 1, &#65533; p2,&#65533;b), to the products ( p &#65533;1 &#8242; , &#65533; p2 ,&#65533;b &#8242; ) of the 
collision. After relabeling the integration variables, the above equation is transformed to 
J&#967; = &#8722; 1 d3p &#65533;1d3p &#65533;2d2&#65533;b|&#65533; v1 &#8722;&#65533; v2|[f1(p &#65533;1 &#8242; )f1(p &#65533;2 &#8242; )&#8722;f1(p &#65533;1)f1(p &#65533;2)][&#967;(p &#65533;1 &#8242; ) +&#967;(p &#65533;2 &#8242; )]. 2 
(III.75) 
Averaging the last two equations leads to 
J&#967; = &#8722;	1 d3p &#65533;1d3&#65533; p2d2&#65533;b|&#65533; v1 &#8722;&#65533; v2|[f1(p &#65533;1)f1(p &#65533;2)&#8722;f1(p &#65533;1 &#8242; )f1(p &#65533;2 &#8242; )] 4 (III.76)

which is zero from eq.(III.71). 
Let us explore the consequences of this result for the evolution of expectation values 
involving &#967;. Substituting for the collision term in eq.(III.72) the streaming terms on the 
left hand side of the Boltzmann equation, leads to 
J&#967;(&#65533;	= p&#967;(&#65533; q, t) &#8706;&#945; +F&#945; p,&#65533; = (III.77) q, t) d3&#65533; p,&#65533; &#8706; t + p&#945; &#8706;f1(&#65533; q, t) 0 , m &#8706;p &#945; 
where we have introduced the notations &#8706;t &#8801; &#8706;/&#8706;t, &#8706;&#945; &#8801; &#8706;/&#8706;q &#945;, and F&#945; = &#8722;&#8706;U/&#8706;q &#945;. We

&#65533; &#65533; &#8226; The Zeroth law: Equilibrium properties are discussed in thermodynamics by placing 
two previously isolated systems in contact, and allowing them to exchange heat. We 
can similarly bring together two microcanonical systems, and allowing them to exchange energy, but not work. If the original systems have energies E
1 and E2 respectively, the 
combined system has energy E = E1 + E2. Assuming that interactions between the two 
parts are small, each micro-state of the joint system corresponds to a pair of micro-states of the two components, i.e. &#181;= &#181;
1 &#8855;&#181;2, and H(&#181;1 &#8855;&#181;2) = H1(&#181;1)+H2(&#181;2). As the joint 
system is in a microcanonical ensemble of energy E = E1 + E2, in equilibrium 
1 1 for H1(&#181;1) +H2(&#181;2) = E 
pE(&#181;1 &#8855;&#181;2) = &#183; . (IV.3) &#937;(E) 0 otherwise 
Since only the overall energy is &#64257;xed, the total allowed phase space is computed from
S1(E1) +S2(E &#8722;E1)&#937;(E) = dE1&#937;1(E1)&#937;2(E &#8722;E1) = dE1 exp . (IV.4) kB 
&#8727; The properties of the two systems in the new joint equilibrium state are implicit in 
eq.(IV.3). We can make them explicit by examining the entropy that follows from eq.(IV.4). Extensivity of entropies suggests that S
1 and S2, are proportional to the number of particles 
in the systems, making the integrand in eq.(IV.4) an exponentially large quantity. Hence the integral can be equated by the saddle point method to the maximum value of the 
1 , i.e. integrand, obtained for energies E
&#8727; &#8727;and E= 1 2 E &#8722;E
&#8727; &#8727; 
&#8727; &#8727; S(E) = kB ln &#937;(E)&#8776; S1(E1 ) +S2(E2 ). (IV.5) 
The position of the maximum is obtained by extremizing the exponent in eq.(IV.4) with 
respect to E1, resulting in the condition, 
&#8706;S1 &#65533; &#8706;S2 &#65533; &#65533; = &#65533; . (IV.6) &#8706;E1 &#8706;E2 x1 x2 
Although all joint micro-states are equally likely, the above results indicate that there

joint system starts in the vicinity of the point ( E1, E2). After the exchange of energy takes 
place, the combined system explores a whole set of new micro-states. The probabilistic 
arguments provide no information on the dynamics of evolution amongst these micro&#173;states, or on the amount of time needed to establish equilibrium. However, once su&#64259;cient

&#65533;time has elapsed so that the assumption of equal a priori probabilities is again valid, the 
1 , E2 ). At this &#8727; &#8727;system is overwhelmingly likely to be at a state with internal energies ( E
&#8727; &#8727; equilibrium point, condition (IV.6) is satis&#64257;ed, specifying a relation between two functions 
of state. These state functions are thus equivalent to empirical temperatures, and indeed, 
consistent with the fundamental result of thermodynamics, we have 
&#8706;S &#65533; 1 &#65533; = . (IV.7) &#8706;E T x 
&#8226; The &#64257;rst law: We next inquire about the variations of S(E,x) with x, by changing the 
coordinates by &#948;x. This results in doing work on the system by an amount &#175;= J&#183; dW &#948; x, 
and changes the internal energy to E + J&#183; &#948;x. The &#64257;rst order change in entropy is given 
by 
&#8706;S &#65533; &#8706; S &#65533; 
&#948;S = S(E + J&#183; &#948;x,x + &#948;x)&#8722;S(E,x) = J+ &#183; &#948;x . (IV.8) &#8706;E &#8706; x x E 
This change will occur spontaneously, taking the system into a more probable state, unless the quantity in brackets in zero. Using eq.(IV.7), this allows us to identify the derivatives 
&#8706;S &#65533; J
i &#65533; = &#8722; . (IV.9) &#8706;xi E,x jT 
=i 
Having thus identi&#64257;ed all variations of S, we have 
dE J&#183; dx dS(E,x) = &#8722; , =&#8658; dE = TdS +J&#183; dx, (IV.10) T T 
allowing us to identify the heat input dQ &#175;= TdS. 
&#8226; The second law: Clearly, the above statistical de&#64257;nition of equilibrium rests on the 
presence of many degrees of freedom N &#8811; 1, which make it exponentially unlikely in N, 
1 , E2 ). By that the combined systems is found with component energies di&#64256;erent from ( E
this construction, the equilibrium point has a larger number of accessible states than the starting point, i.e. 
&#8727; &#8727; &#937;1(E1 ,x1)&#937;2(E2 ,x2)&#8805; &#937;1(E1,x1)&#937;2(E2,x2). (IV.11) 
In the process of evolving to the more likely (and more densely populated) regions, there is an irreversible loss of information, accompanied by an increase in entropy, 
&#8727; &#8727; &#948;S = S1(E1 ) +S2(E2 )&#8722;S1(E1)&#8722;S2(E2)&#8805; 0, (IV.12)

          <text>&#65533; &#65533; The heat capacity of the system, given by

vanishes at both low and high temperatures. The vanishing of C as exp( &#8722;&#491;/kBT) at low 
temperatures is characteristic of all systems with an energy gap separating the ground state 
and lowest excited states. The vanishing of C at high temperatures is a saturation e&#64256;ect, 
common to systems with a maximum in the number of states as a function of energy. In 
between, the heat capacity exhibits a peak at a characteristic temperature of T&#491; &#8733; &#491;/kB. 
Statistical mechanics provides much more than just macroscopic quantities such as 
energy and heat capacity. Eq.(IV.16) is a complete joint probability distribution with 
considerable information on the micro-states. For example, the unconditional probability for exciting a particular impurity is obtained from 
&#65533; &#937;(E &#8722;n
1&#491;, N &#8722;1) p(n1) = p({ni}) = . (IV.23) &#937;(E, N){n2,&#183;&#183;&#183;,nN } 
The second equality is obtained by noting that once the energy taken by the &#64257;rst impurity 
is speci&#64257;ed, the remaining energy must be distributed among the other N &#8722;1 impurities. 
Using eq.(IV.17), 
&#937;(E, N &#8722;1) ( N &#8722;1)! N1! (N &#8722;N1)! N1 p(n1 = 0) = = &#183; = 1&#8722; , (IV.24) &#937;(E, N) N1! (N &#8722;N1 &#8722;1)! N! N 
and p(n1 = 1) = 1 &#8722;p(n1 = 0) = N1/N. Using N1 = E/&#491;, and eq.(IV.21), the occupation 
probabilities at a temperature T are 
1 exp &#8722;kB &#491;
T p(0) = &#65533; &#65533;  , a nd p(1) = &#65533; &#65533; . ( IV.25)

&#65533; that all points on this surface are mutually accessible. The central postulate of statistical 
mechanics is that the equilibrium probability distribution is given by 
1 1 for H(&#181;) = E 
p(E,x)(&#181;) = &#183; . (IV.1) &#937;(E,x) 0 otherwise 
Some remarks and clari&#64257;cation on the above postulate are in order: 
(1) Boltzmann&#8217;s  a ssumption  o f e qual  a priori equilibrium  p robabilities  re fers to the above 
postulate, which is in fact the unbiased probability estimate in phase space subject 
to the constraint of constant energy. This assignment is consistent with, but not 
required by, Liouville&#8217;s theorem. Note that the phase space, specifying the micro&#173;
states &#181;, must be composed of canonically conjugate pairs . Under a canonical change 
of variables, &#181; &#8594; &#181; &#8242; , volumes in phase space are left invariant. The Jacobian of such 
transformations is unity, and the transformed probability, p(&#181; &#8242; ) = p(&#181;)|&#8706;&#181;/&#8706;&#181; &#8242; |, is 
again uniform on the surface of constant energy. 
(2) The n ormalization  f actor &#937;(E , x), is the area of the surface of constant energy E 
in phase space. To avoid subtleties associated with densities that are non-zero only a surface, is sometimes more convenient to de&#64257;ne the microcanonical ensemble by 
requiring E &#8722;&#916; &#8804; H(&#181;)&#8804; E + &#916;, i.e. assigning the energy of the ensemble up to an 
uncertainty of &#916;. In this case, the accessible phase space forms a shell of thickness 
&#916; around the surface of energy E. The normalization is now the volume of the shell, 
&#937; 
&#8242; &#8776; 2&#916;&#937;. Since &#937; typically depends exponentially on E, as long as &#916; &#8764; O(E0) (or 
even O(E1)), the di&#64256;erence between the surface and volume of the shell is negligible 
in the E &#8733; N &#8594; &#8734; limit, and we shall use &#937; and &#937; &#8242; interchangeably. 
(3) The e ntropy o f this uniform probability distribution is given by 
S(E,x) = kB ln &#937;(E,x). (IV.2) 
An additional factor of kB is introduced compared to the de&#64257;nition of eq.(III.68), so 
that the entropy has the correct dimensions of energy per degrees Kelvin, used in 
thermodynamics. &#937; and S are not changed by a canonical change of coordinates in 
phase space. For a collection of independent systems, the overall allowed phase space 
is the product of individual ones, i.e. &#937; Total = i &#937;i. The resulting entropy is thus 
additive, as expected for an extensive quantity. 
Various results in thermodynamics now follow from eq.(IV.1), provided that we con&#173;
sider macroscopic systems with many degrees of freedom.

&#65533; 
&#65533; as required by the second law of thermodynamics. When the two bodies are &#64257;rst brought
into contact, the equality in eq.(IV.6) does not hold. The change in entropy is such that
&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#8706;S1 &#65533; &#8706;S2 &#65533; 1 1 &#948;S = &#65533; &#8722; &#65533; &#948;E1 = &#8722; &#948;E1 &#8805; 0, (IV.13) &#8706;E1 &#65533; &#8706;E2 &#65533; T1 T2 x1 x2 
i.e. heat (energy) &#64258;ows from the hotter to the colder body, as in Clausius&#8217;s statement of the second law. 
&#8226; Stability conditions: Since the point ( E
1 &#8727;, E2 &#8727;) is a maximum, the second derivative of 
S1(E1) +S2(E2) must be negative at this point, i.e. 
&#8706;2S1 &#65533;&#65533; &#8706;2S2 &#65533;&#65533; 
&#8706;E2 &#65533; + &#8706;E2 &#65533; &#8804; 0. (IV.14) 
1 x1 2 x2 
Applying the above condition to two parts of the same system, the condition of thermal 
stability, Cx &#8805; 0, as discussed in section (I.I), is regained. Similarly, the second order 
changes in eq.(IV.8) must be negative, requiring that the matrtix &#8706;2S/&#8706;x i&#8706;xj be positive E 
de&#64257;nite. 
IV.C Two&#8211;Level Systems 
Consider N impurity atoms trapped in a solid matrix. Each impurity can be in one 
of two states, with energies 0 and &#491; respectively. This example is somewhat di&#64256;erent from 
the situations considered so far, in that the allowed micro-states are discrete. Liouville&#8217;s theorem applies to Hamiltonian evolution in a continuous phase space. Although, there is 
less ambiguity in enumeration of discrete states, the dynamics that ensures that all allowed 
micro-states are equally accessed will remain unspeci&#64257;ed for the moment. (An example from quantum mechanical evolution will be presented later on.) 
The micro-states of the two level system are speci&#64257;ed by the set of occupation numbers 
{n
i}, where ni = 0 or 1 depending on whether the ith impurity is in its ground state or 
excited. The overall energy is 
N 
H({ni}) = &#491; n i &#8801; &#491;N1, (IV.15) 
i=1 
where N1 is the total number of excited impurities. The macro-state is speci&#64257;ed by the 
total energy E, and the number of impurities N. The microcanonical probability is thus 
1 p({ni}) = &#948; . (IV.16) &#937;(E, N) &#491; i ni,E

          <text>IV. Classical Statistical Mechanics
IV.A General De&#64257;nitions 
&#8226; Statistical Mechanics is a probabilistic  a pproach t o e quilibrium  ma croscopic p roper&#173;
ties o f l arge n umbers of d egrees o f  f reedom. 
As discussed in chapter I, equilibrium properties of macroscopic bodies are phe&#173;
nomenologically described by the laws of thermodynamics. The macro-state M, depends 
on a relatively small number of thermodynamic coordinates. To provide a more funda&#173;
mental derivation of these properties, we can examine the dynamics of the many degrees of freedom N, comprising a macroscopic body. Description of each micro-state &#181;, requires 
an enormous amount of information, and the corresponding time evolution, governed by the Hamiltonian equations (discussed in chapter II), is usually quite complicated. Rather 
than following the evolution of an individual (pure) micro-state, statistical mechanics ex&#173;
amines an ensemble of micro-states corresponding to a given (mixed) macro-state. It aims to provide the probabilities p
M(&#181;), for the equilibrium ensemble. Liouville&#8217;s theorem jus&#173;
ti&#64257;es the assumption that all accessible micro-states are equally likely in an equilibrium ensemble. As discussed in chapter III, such assignment of probabilities is subjective. In this chapter we shall provide unbiased estimates of p
M(&#181;) for a number of di&#64256;erent equi&#173;
librium ensembles. A central conclusion is that in the thermodynamic limit of large N all 
these ensembles are in fact equivalent. In contrast to kinetic theory, equilibrium statistical mechanics leaves out the question of how various systems achieve equilibrium. 
IV.B The Microcanonical Ensemble 
Our starting point in thermodynamics is a mechanically and adiabatically isolated 
system. In the absence of heat or work input to the system, the internal energy E, and 
the generalized coordinates x, are &#64257;xed, specifying a macro-state M &#8801; (E,x). The corre&#173;
sponding set of mixed micro-states form the microcanonical ensemble. In classical statisti&#173;
cal mechanics, these microstates are de&#64257;ned by points in phase space, their time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian H(&#181;), as discussed in Chapter II. Since the Hamiltonian equa&#173;
tions (II.1) conserve the total energy of a given system, all micro-states are con&#64257;ned to the surface H(&#181;) = E in phase space. Assume that there are no other conserved quantities, so

&#65533; 
&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; As there are N1 = E/&#491; excited impurities, the normalization &#937; is the number of ways of 
choosing N1 excited levels among the available N, and given by the binomial coe&#64259;cient 
N! &#937;(E, N) = . (IV.17) N1! (N &#8722;N1)! 
The entropy 
N! S(E, N) = kB ln , (IV.18) N1! (N &#8722;N1)!
can be simpli&#64257;ed by Stirling&#8217;s formula in the limit of N1, N &#8811; 1 to 
N1 N1 N &#8722;N1 N &#8722;N1S(E, N)&#8776; &#8722;NkB ln + ln N N N N &#65533;&#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533; ( IV.19) E E E E = &#8722;NkB ln + 1 &#8722; ln 1&#8722; . N&#491; N&#491; N&#491; N&#491; 
The equilibrium temperature can now be calculated from eq.(IV.7) as 
1 &#8706;S &#65533; kB E = = &#8722; ln . (IV.20) T &#8706;E &#65533; &#491; N&#491; &#8722;EN 
Alternatively, the internal energy at a temperature T, is given by 
N&#491; E(T) = &#65533; &#65533;  . ( IV.21) 
exp kB &#491;
T + 1 
The internal energy is a monotonic function of temperature, increasing from a minimum 
value of 0 at T = 0 to a maximum value of N&#491;/2 at in&#64257;nite temperature. It is, however, 
possible to start with energies larger than N&#491;/2, which correspond to negative temperatures 
from eq.(IV.20). The origin of the negative temperature is the decrease in the number of 
microstates with increasing energy, the opposite of what happens in most systems. Two level systems have an upper bound on their energy, and very few microstates close to this maximal energy. Hence increased energy leads to more order in the system. However, once a negative temperature system is brought into contact with the rest of the universe (or any portion of it without an upper bound in energy), it loses its excess energy and 
comes to equilibrium at a positive temperature. The world of negative temperatures is 
quite unusual in that systems can be cooled by adding heat, and heated by removing it. There are physical examples of systems temporarily prepared at a metastable equilibrium of negative temperature in lasers, and for magnetic spins.

The full phase space density contains much more information than necessary for de&#173;
scription of equilibrium properties. For example, knowledge of the one particle distribution 
is su&#64259;cient for computing the pressure of a gas. A one particle density refers to the ex&#173;pectation value of &#64257;nding any of the N particles at location /vector q, with momentum p /vector, at time 
t, which is computed from the full density &#961; as

To obtain the second identity above, we used the &#64257;rst pair of delta functions to perform one set of integrals, and then assumed that the density is symmetric with respect to permuting the particles. Similarly, a two particle density can be computed from 
/integraldisplay

f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vector q2, t) = N(N &#8722;1) dVi &#961;(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vector q2,&#183; &#183; &#183; , /vector pN,/vector qN, t), (III.17) 
i=3 
where dVi = d3p /vectorid3q /vectori is the contribution of particle i to phase space volume. The general 
s-particle density is de&#64257;ned by

where &#961;s is a standard unconditional PDF for the coordinates of s particles, and &#961;N &#8801; &#961;. 
While &#961;s is properly normalized to unity when integrated over all its variables, the s-
particle density has a normalization of N!/(N &#8722; s)!. We shall use the two quantities 
interchangeably. 
The evolution of the few-body densities is governed by the BBGKY hierarchy of 
equations attributed to Bogoliubov, Born, Green, Kirkwood, and Yvon. The simplest non-trivial Hamiltonian studied in kinetic theory is

H(p,q) = + U(/vector qi) + V(/vector qi &#8722;/vector qj). (III.19) 2m 2 i=1 (i ,j)=1  
This Hamiltonian provides an adequate description of a weakly interacting gas. In addition
to the classical kinetic energy of particles of mass m, it contains an external potential

&#8226; The Boltzmann equation is obtained from eq.(III.38) after the substitution 
f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vectorb,&#8722;;t) = f1(p /vector1,/vector q1, t)&#183; f1(p /vector2,/vector q1, t), (III.40) 
known as the assumption of molecular chaos. Note that even if one starts with an uncor&#173;
related initial probability distribution for particles, there is no guarantee that correlations 
are not generated as a result of collisions. The &#64257;nal result is the following closed form 
equation for f1 
&#8706; &#8706;U &#8706; /vector p 1 &#8706; &#8722; &#183; + &#183; f1 = &#8706;t &#8706;/vector q 1 &#8706;/vector p1 m &#8706;/vector q 1

(III.41) 
Given the complexity of the above &#8216;derivation&#8217; of the Boltzmann equation, it is appro&#173;
priate to provide a heuristic explanation. The streaming terms on the left hand side of the 
equation describe the motion of a single particle in the external potential U. The collision 
terms on the right hand side have a simple physical interpretation: The probability of &#64257;nding a particle of momentum p /vector
1 at /vector q1 is suddenly altered if it undergoes a collision with 
another particle of momentum p /vector2. The probability of such a collision is the product of 
kinematic factors described by the di&#64256;erential cross-section |d&#963;/d&#937;|, the &#8216;&#64258;ux&#8217; of incident 
particles proportional to |/vector v2 &#8722;/vector v1|, and the joint probability of &#64257;nding the two particles, ap&#173;
proximated by f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2). The &#64257;rst term on the right hand side of eq.(III.41) subtracts 
this probability and integrates over all possible momenta and solid angles describing the collision. The second term represents an addition to the probability which results from the 
inverse process: A particle can suddenly appear with coordinates ( p /vector
1,/vector q1) as a result of a 
collision between two particles initially with momenta p /vector1 &#8242; and p /vector2 &#8242; . The cross-section, and 
the momenta ( p /vector1 &#8242; , /vector p2 &#8242; ) may have a complicated dependence on ( p /vector1, /vector p2) and &#937;, determined 
by the speci&#64257;c form of the potential V. Remarkably, various equilibrium properties of the 
gas are quite independent of this potential.

For evaluating the time evolution of fs, it is convenient to divide the Hamiltonian into 
H = Hs +HN&#8722;s +H &#8242; , (III.20) 
where Hs and HN&#8722;s include only interactions among each group of particles,

From eq.(III.18), the time evolution of fs (or&#961;s) is obtained as

where eq.(III.9) is used for the evolution of &#961;. The three Poisson brackets in eq.(III.23)

          <text>The analysis is somewhat more complicated for long range interactions, such as the 
Coulomb gas in a plasma. For a neutral plasma, the Debye screening length &#955; replaces 
d in the above equation, as discussed in the problems. 
(c) There are also collision terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.28), which depend on 
fs+1, and lead to an inverse time scale 
/integraldisplay /integraldisplay 1 &#8764; dV &#8706;V &#183; &#8706; f s+1 &#8764; dV &#8706;V &#183; &#8706; N &#961;s+1 . &#964;&#215; &#8706;/vector q &#8706;/vector p fs &#8706;/vector q &#8706;/vector p &#961;s 
The integrals are only non-zero over the volume of the inter-particle potential d3 . The 
term fs+1/fs is related to the probability of &#64257;nding another particle per unit volume, 
which is roughly the particle density n = N/V &#8776; 1026m&#8722;3 . We thus obtain the mean 
free time 
&#964;c 1 &#964;&#215; &#8776; &#8776; , (III.31) nd3 nvd2 
which is the typical distance a particle travels between collisions. For short range interactions, &#964;
&#215; &#8776; 10&#8722;8s is much longer than &#964;c, and the collision terms on the right 
hand side of eqs.(III.28) are smaller by a factor of nd3 &#8776; (1026m&#8722;3)(10&#8722;10m)3 &#8776; 10&#8722;4 . 
TheBoltzmann equation is obtained for short range interactions in the dilute regime by 
exploiting &#964;c/&#964;&#215; &#8776; nd3 &#8810; 1. (By contrast, for long range interactions such that nd3 &#8811; 1, 
the Vlasov equation is obtained by dropping the collision terms on the left hand side, as 
discussed in the problems.) From the above discussion, it is apparent that eq.(III.29) is di&#64256;erent from the rest of the hierarchy: It is the only one in which the collision terms are absent from the left hand side. For all other equations, the right hand side is smaller by a factor of nd
3, while in eq.(III.29) it may indeed dominate the left hand side. Thus a 
possible approximation scheme is to truncate the equations after the &#64257;rst two, by setting 
the right hand side of eq.(III.30) to zero. 
Setting the right hand side of the equation for f2 to zero implies that the two body 
density evolves as in an isolated two-particle system. The relatively simple mechanical 
processes that govern this evolution result in streaming terms for f2 which are proportional 
to both &#964;U &#8722;1 and &#964;c &#8722;1 . The two sets of terms can be more or less treated independently: 
the former describe the evolution of the center of mass of the two particles, while the latter govern the dependence on relative coordinates.

of motion for incoming colliding particles of momenta &#8722;p /vector1 and &#8722;p /vector2. In terms of these 
momenta, we can write 
d f1 /vextendsingle /vextendsingle = d3p /vector2 d2/vectorb|/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2| f2(p /vector1 &#8242; ,/vector q1, /vector p2 &#8242; ,/vectorb,&#8722;;t)&#8722;f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vectorb,&#8722;;t) . (III.37) dt coll. 
It is sometimes more convenient to describe the scattering of two particles in terms of 
the relative momenta p /vector= p /vector1 &#8722;/vector p2 and p /vector&#8242; = p /vector1 &#8242; &#8722;/vector p2 &#8242; , before and after the collision. For a 
given /vectorb, the initial momentum p /vectoris deterministically transformed to the &#64257;nal momentum 
p /vector&#8242; . To &#64257;nd the functional form p /vector&#8242; (|p /vector|,/vectorb), one must integrate the equations of motion. 
However, it is possible to make some general statements based on conservation laws: In 
elastic collisions, the magnitude of /vector p is preserved, and it merely rotates to a &#64257;nal direction 
indicated by the angles ( &#952;, &#966;)&#8801; &#710;b) (a unit vector) in spherical coordinates. Since there &#937;(/vector
is a one to one correspondence between the impact vector /vectorb, and the solid angle &#937;, we 
make a change of variables between the two, resulting in 
d f1 /vextendsingle /vextendsingle d&#963; /vextendsingle /vextendsingle = d3p /vector2d2&#937; /vextendsingle /vextendsingle  |/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2| f2(p /vector1 &#8242; ,/vector q1, /vector p2 &#8242; ,/vectorb,&#8722;;t)&#8722;f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vectorb,&#8722;;t) . dt coll. d&#937; 
(III.38) 
The Jacobian of this transformation, |d&#963;/d&#937;|, has dimensions of area, and is known as 
the di&#64256;erential cross-section . It is equal to the area presented to an incoming beam which 
scatters into the solid angle &#937;. The out-going momenta p /vector1 &#8242; and p /vector2 &#8242; in eq.(III.38) are now 
obtained from the two conditions /vector p1 &#8242; + p /vector2 &#8242; = p /vector1 + p /vector2 (conservation of momentum), and 
&#8242; p2|&#710; p /vector1 &#8722;p /vector2 &#8242; = |p /vector1 &#8722;/vector&#937;(/vectorb) (conservation of energy), as

For the scattering of two hard spheres of diameter D, it is easy to show that the 
scattering angle is related to the impact parameter b by cos( &#952;/2) = b/D for all &#966;. The

over all angles leads to the total cross&#8211;section of &#963; = &#960;D2, which is evidently correct. The

To estimate the relative importance of the di&#64256;erent terms appearing in eqs.(III.28), 
let us examine the &#64257;rst two equations in the hierarchy,

/integraldisplay /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg The density f2 is proportional to the joint PDF &#961;2 for &#64257;nding one particle at ( p /vector1,/vector q1), 
and another at ( p /vector2,/vector q2), at the same time t. It is reasonable to expect that at distances 
much larger than the range of the potential V, the particles are independent, i.e. 
&#961;2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vector q2, t)&#8722;&#8594; &#961;1(p /vector1,/vector q1, t)&#961;1(p /vector2,/vector q2, t), or 
(III.32) 
f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vector q2, t)&#8722;&#8594; f1(p /vector1,/vector q1, t)f1(p /vector2,/vector q2, t), for |/vector q2 &#8722;q /vector1| &#8811;d. 
The above statement should be true even for situations out of equilibrium. For example, 
imagine that the gas particles in a chamber are suddenly allowed to invade an empty volume 
after the removal of a barrier. The density f1 will undergo a complicated evolution, and 
its relaxation time will be at least comparable to &#964;U. The two particle density f2, will also 
reach its &#64257;nal value at a comparable time interval. However, it is expected to relax to a 
form similar to eq.(III.32) over a much shorter time of the order of &#964;c. 
For the collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.29), we actually need the precise 
dependence of f2 on the relative coordinates and momenta at separations comparable to d. 
At time intervals longer than &#964;c (but possibly shorter than &#964;U), the &#8216;steady state&#8217; behavior 
of f2 at small relative distances is obtained by equating the largest streaming terms in 
eq.(III.30), i.e. 
p /vector1 &#8706; p /vector 2 &#8706; &#8706; V(/vector q1 &#8722;q /vector2) &#8706; &#8706; &#183; + &#183; &#8722; &#183; &#8722; f2 = 0. (III.33) m &#8706;/vector q 1 m &#8706;/vector q 2 &#8706;/vector q1 &#8706;/vector p1 &#8706;/vector p2 
We expect f2(/vector q1,/vector q2) to have slow variations over the center of mass coordinate Q/vector= (/vector q1 + 
/vector q2)/2, and large variations over the relative coordinate q /vector= /vector q2 &#8722;/vector q1. Therefore, &#8706;f2/&#8706;/vector q &#8811; 
&#8706;f2/&#8706;Q/vector, and &#8706;f2//vector q2 &#8776; &#8722;&#8706;f2/&#8706;/vector q1 &#8776; &#8706;f2/&#8706;/vector q, leading to 
&#8706;V(/vector q1 &#8722;q /vector2) &#8706; &#8706; p /vector1 &#8722;p /vector2 &#8706; &#183; &#8722; f2 = &#8722; &#183; f2 . (III.34) &#8706;/vector q1 &#8706;/vector p1 &#8706;/vector p2 m &#8706;/vector q 
The above equation provides a precise mathematical expression for how f2 is constrained 
along the trajectories that describe the collision of the two particles. 
The collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.29) can now be written as

In the absence of interactions with other particles, the density &#961;s for a group of 
s particles evolves as the density of an incompressible &#64258;uid (as required by Liouville&#8217;s 
theorem), and is described by the streaming terms on the left hand side of eq.(III.27). 
However, because of interactions with the remaining N &#8722;s particles, the &#64258;ow is modi&#64257;ed 
by the collision terms on the right hand side. The collision integral is the sum of the terms 
corresponding to a potential collision of any of the particles in the group of s, with any 
of the remaining N &#8722; s particles. To describe the probability of &#64257;nding the additional 
particle that collides with a member of this group, the result must depend on the joint PDF of s+1 particles described by &#961;
s+1. This results in a hierarchy of equations in which 
&#8706;&#961;1/&#8706;t depends on &#961;2, &#8706;&#961;2/&#8706;t depends on &#961;3, etc., which is at least as complicated as 
the original equation for the full phase space density. To proceed further, a physically motivated approximation for terminating the hierarchy is needed.

/vextendsingle /integraldisplay /bracketleftBig /bracketrightBig The &#64257;rst identity if obtained from eq.(III.29) by noting that the added term proportional 
to &#8706;f2/&#8706;/vector p2 is a complete derivative and integrates to zero, while the second equality follows 
from eq.(III.34), after the change of variables to /vector q = /vector q2 &#8722;q /vector1. (Since it relies on establishing 
the &#8216;steady state&#8217; in the relative coordinates, this approximation is valid as long as we examine events in time with a resolution longer than &#964;
c.) 
&#8226; Kinematics of collision and scattering: The integrand in eq.(III.35) is a derivative of 
f2 with respect to q /vectoralong the direction of relative motion /vector p = p /vector2 &#8722;p /vector1, of the colliding 
particles. To perform this integration we introduce a convenient coordinate system for /vector q, 
guided by the formalism used to describe the scattering of particles. Naturally, we choose 
one axis to be parallel to p /vector2 &#8722;/vector p1, with the corresponding coordinate a which is negative 
before a collision, and positive afterwards. The other two coordinates of /vector q are represented 
by an impact vector /vectorb which is /vector0 for a head&#8211;on collision ([ p /vector1 &#8722;p /vector2]/bardbl [q /vector1 &#8722;/vector q2]). We can now 
integrate over a to get 
d f1 /vextendsingle /vextendsingle = d3p /vector2 d2/vectorb|/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2| f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vectorb,+;t)&#8722;f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vectorb,&#8722;;t) , (III.36) dt coll. 
where |/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2| = |p /vector1 &#8722;p /vector2|/m is the relative speed of the two particles, with ( /vectorb,&#8722;) and 
(/vectorb,+) referring to relative coordinates before and after the collision. Note that d2/vectorb|/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2| 
is just the &#64258;ux of particles impinging on the element of area d2/vectorb. 
In principle, the integration over a is from &#8722;&#8734; to +&#8734;, but as the variations of f2 
are only signi&#64257;cant over the interaction range d, we can evaluate the above quantities 
at separations of a few d from the collision point. This is a good compromise, allowing 
us to evaluate f2 away from the collisions, but at small enough separations so that we 
can ignore the di&#64256;erence between /vector q1 and /vector q2. This amounts to a coarse-graining in space 
which eliminates variations on scales &#64257;ner than d. With these provisos, it is tempting to 
close the equation for f1, by using the assumption of uncorrelated particles in eq.(III.32). 
Clearly some care is necessary as a naive substitution gives zero! The key observation is 
that the densities f2 for situations corresponding to before and after the collision have to 
be treated di&#64256;erently. For example, soon after opening of the slot separating empty and 
full gas containers, the momenta of the gas particles are likely to point away from the 
slot. Collisions will tend to randomize momenta, yielding a more isotropic distribution. However, the densities f
2 before and after the collision are related by streaming, implying 
that f2(p /vector1,/vector q1, /vector p2,/vectorb,+;t) = f2(p /vector1 &#8242; ,/vector q1, /vector p2 &#8242; ,/vectorb,&#8722;;t), where p /vector1 &#8242; and p /vector2 &#8242; are momenta whose 
collision at an impact vector /vectorb results in production of outgoing particles with momenta p /vector1

Macro-states of the system depend on only a few thermodynamic functions. We can 
form an ensemble of a large number N, of micro-states &#181;&#945;, corresponding to a given macro&#173;
state. The di&#64256;erent micro-states occur with probabilities p&#945;. (For example p&#945; = 1/Nin 
the absence of any other information.) When we no longer have exact knowledge of the 
microstate, it is said to be in a mixed state . 
Classically, ensemble averages are calculated from

In the previous sections we indicated several failures of classical statistical mechanics, 
which were heuristically remedied by assuming quantized energy levels, while still calculat&#173;
ing thermodynamic quantities from a partition sum Z = exp (&#8722;&#946;En). This implicitly n 
assumes that the micro-states of a quantum system are speci&#64257;ed by its discretized energy 
levels, and governed by a probability distribution similar to a Boltzmann weight. This 
&#8216;analogy&#8217; to classical statistical mechanics needs to be justi&#64257;ed. Furthermore, quantum mechanics is itself inherently probabilistic, with uncertainties unrelated to those that lead to probabilities in statistical mechanics. Here, we shall construct a quantum formulation 
of statistical mechanics by closely following the steps that lead to the classical formulation. 
Micro-states of a classical system of particles are described by the set of coordinates 
and conjugate momenta {p /vector
i,/vector qi}; i.e. by a point in the 6N &#8211;dimensional phase space. In 
quantum mechanics {/vector qi}and {p /vectori}are not independent observables. Instead: 
&#8226; The (micro-) state of a quantum system is completely speci&#64257;ed by a unit vector |&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht, which 
belongs to an in&#64257;nite dimensional Hilbert space . The vector |&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}htcan be written in terms 
of its components &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht, which are complex numbers, along a suitable set of ortho-normal 
basis vectors |n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht. In the convenient notation introduced by Dirac, this decomposition is 
written as 
|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht |n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht. (VI.62) 
n 
The most familiar basis is that of coordinates |{/vector qi}&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht, and &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t{q /vectori}|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht &#8801;&#936;(/vector q1,...,/vector q N) is the 
wave-function. The normalization condition is 
&#8727; &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t&#936;|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht = 
n &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t&#936;|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= 1, wh ere &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t&#936;|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht &#8801; &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht. (VI.63) 
For example, in the coordinate basis, we must require 
/integraldisplay N 
&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t&#936;|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht = ddq /vectori |&#936;(/vector q1,...,/vector q N)|2 = 1. ( VI.64) 
i=1 
&#8226; Classically, various observables are functions O({p /vectori,/vector qi}), de&#64257;ned in phase space. In 
quantum mechanics, these functions are replaced by Hermitian matrices (operators) in 
Hilbert space, obtained by substituting operators for {/vector qi}and {p /vectori}in the classical ex&#173;
pression (after proper symmetrization of products, e.g. pq (p q  + q p)/2). These basic &#8594; 
operators satisfy the commutation relations, 
&#175;h [pj,qk ]&#8801;pjqk &#8722;qkpj = &#948;j,k . (VI.65) i

/summationdisplay Classically, the probability (density) &#961;(t) is a function de&#64257;ned on phase space. As all 
operators in phase space, it is replaced by a matrix in quantum mechanics. Stripped of 
the choice of basis, the density matrix is 
&#961;(t) = p&#945;|&#936;&#945;(t)&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t&#936;&#945;(t)|. (VI.77) 
&#945; 
Clearly, &#961; c orresponds to a pure state if and only if &#961;2 = &#961;. 
The density matrix satis&#64257;es the following properties: 
(i) Normalization: Since each |&#936;&#945;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}htis normalized to unity, 
&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t1&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= tr(&#961;) =

&#945; p&#945; = 1. ( VI.78) 
(ii) Hermiticity: The density matrix is Hermitian, i.e. &#961;&#8224; = &#961;, since 
&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tm|&#961;&#8224;|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#961;|m&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht &#8727; =

ensuring that the averages in eq.(VI.76) are real numbers. 
(iii) Positivity: For any |&#934;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht, 
&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{t&#934;|&#961;|&#934;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht=

Thus &#961; i s positive de&#64257;nite , implying that all its eigenvalues must be positive. 
&#8226; Liouville&#8217;s theorem governs the time evolution of the classical density as

is most convenient to examine the evolution of the quantum density matrix in the basis

ous equilibrium quantum density matrices can now be constructed in analogy to classical

Th
e &#64257;rst condition states that only eigen-states of the correct energy can appear in the 
quantum wave-function, and that (for p&#945; = 1/N) such states on average have the same 
amplitude, |&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#936;&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht|2 = 1/&#937;. This is equivalent to the classical postulate of equal a priori 
equilibrium probabilities. The second (additional) condition states that the &#937; eigen-states 
of energy E a re combined in a typical micro-state with independent random phases . (Note 
that the normalization condition tr &#961; = 1, implies that &#937;( E) = &#948;(E&#8722;En) is the number n 
of eigen-states of Hwith energy E.) 
&#8226; Canonical ensemble: A &#64257;xed temperature T = 1/kB&#946;, can be achieved by putting the 
system in contact with a reservoir. By considering the combined system, the canonical density matrix is obtained as 
&#961;(&#946;) = exp(&#8722;&#946;H) . (VI.86) 
Z(&#946;) 
The normalization condition tr(&#961; ) = 1, leads to the quantum partition function 
Z = tr e &#8722;&#946;H = e &#8722;&#946;En . (VI.87)

The &#64257;nal sum is over the (discrete) energy levels of H, and justi&#64257;es the calculations per&#173;

To ensure that the expectation value &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tO&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}htis real, the operators Omust be Hermitian , i.e. 
satisfy 
&#8224; &#8224; &#8727; O = O, where &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tm|O |n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht &#8801; &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|O|m&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht. (VI.68) 
When replacing p /vectorand q /vectorin a classical operator O({p /vectori,/vector qi}) by corresponding matrices, 
proper symmetrization of various products is necessary to ensure the above Hermiticity. 
Time evolution of micro-states is governed by the Hamiltonian H({p /vectori,/vector qi}). A clas&#173;
sical microstate evolves according to Hamilton&#8217;s equations of motion, while in quantum 
mechanics the state vector changes in time according to 
&#8706; i&#175;h&#8706;t |&#936;(t)&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= H|&#936;(t)&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht. (VI.69) 
A convenient basis is one that diagonalizes the matrix H. The energy eigen-states satisfy 
H|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= En|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht, where En are the eigen-energies . Substituting |&#936;(t)&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tn|&#936;(t)&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}htin 
eq.(VI.69), and taking advantage of the ortho-normality condition &#8733;a\}b&#8711;acketle{tm|n&#8733;a\}b&#8711;acket&#8711;i}ht= &#948;m,n, yields

way to think of the particle is as a wave-packet of size &#955; = h /&#8730;2&#960;mk BT , the thermal

&#65533; &#65533; with a reservoir R, at temperature T and chemical potential &#181;. The probability distribu&#173;
tion for the micro-states of S is obtained by summing over all states of the reservoir, as in 
eq.(IV.53), and is given by 
p(&#181;S) = exp[ &#946;&#181;N(&#181;S)&#8722;&#946;H(&#181;S)]/Q. (IV.99) 
The normalization factor is the grand partition function, 
Q(T, &#181;,x) = e&#946;&#181;N(&#181;S )&#8722;&#946;H(&#181;S ). (IV.100) 
&#181;S 
We can reorganize the above summation by grouping together all micro-states with a 
given number of particles, i.e. 
&#8734; 
Q(T, &#181;,x) = e&#946;&#181;N e &#8722;&#946;HN (&#181;S). (IV.101) 
N=0 (&#181;S |N) 
The restricted sums in eq.(IV.101) are just the N-particle partition functions. As each term 
in Qis the total weight of all micro-states of N particles, the unconditional probability of 
&#64257;nding N particles in the system is 
e&#946;&#181;NZ(T, N,x) p(N) = . (IV.102) Q(T, &#181;,x) 
The average number of particles in the system is 
1 &#8706; &#8706; &#65533;N&#65533;= &#8706;(&#946;&#181;)Q= &#8706;(&#946;&#181;)lnQ, (IV.103) Q 
while the number &#64258;uctuations are related to the variance 
&#65533;N2 &#65533;C = &#65533;N2 =1 &#8706;2 
lnQ &#8722; &#65533; &#8706; lnQ &#65533;2 
= &#8706;2 
lnQ= &#8706;&#65533;N&#65533;. &#65533; &#8722; &#65533;N&#65533; 2

(IV.104) 
The variance is thus proportional to N, and the relative number &#64258;uctuations vanish in the 
thermodynamic limit, establishing the equivalence of this ensemble to the previous ones. 
Because of the sharpness of the distribution for N, the sum in eq.(IV.101) can be 
approximated by its largest term at N = N&#8727; &#8776;&lt; N &gt; , i.e. 
&#8734; 
Q(T, &#181;,x) = lim &#65533; 
e&#946;&#181;NZ(T, N,x) = e&#946;&#181;N &#8727; Z(T, N &#8727; ,x) = e&#946;&#181;N &#8727; &#8722;</text>

 (IV.107)
As a &#64257;nal example, we compute the properties of the ideal gas of non-interacting 
particles in the grand canonical ensemble. The macro-state is M &#8801;(T, &#181;, V ), and the 
corresponding micro-states {p &#65533;1,&#65533; q1, &#65533; p2,&#65533; q2,&#183;&#183;&#183;} have inde&#64257;nite particle number. The grand 
partition function is given by

G(T, &#181;, V ) = &#8722;kBT lnQ= &#8722;kBTe&#946;&#181; V. (IV.109) &#955;3 
But, since G= E &#8722;TS &#8722;&#181;N = &#8722;PV, the gas pressure can be obtained directly as

          <text>IV.H The Gibbs Canonical Ensemble
We can also de&#64257;ne a generalized canonical ensemble in which the internal energy 
changes by the addition of both heat and work. The macrostates M &#8801;(T,J), are speci&#64257;ed 
in terms of the external temperature and forces acting on the system; the thermodynamic 
coordinates x appear as additional random variables. The system is maintained at constant 
force through external elements (e.g. pistons or magnets). Including the work done against 
the forces, the energy of the combined system that includes these elements is H &#8722;J x.&#183; 
Note that while the work done on the system is +J x, the energy change associated with &#183; 
the external elements with coordinates x has the opposite sign. The microstates of this 
combined system occur with the (canonical) probabilities 
p(&#181;S,x) = exp [ &#8722;&#946;H(&#181;S) +&#946;J x]/Z(T, N,J), (IV.85) &#183; 
with the Gibbs partition function, 
Z(N, T,J) = &#65533; 
e &#946;J&#183;x&#8722;&#946;H(&#181;S ). (IV.86) 
&#181;S ,x 
(Note that we have explicitly included the particle number N to indicate that there is no 
chemical work. Chemical work is considered in the Grand Canonical Ensemble, which is discussed next.) 
In this ensemble, the expectation value of the coordinates is obtained from 
&#8706;lnZ
&#65533;x&#65533;= kBT&#8706;J , (IV.87) 
which together with the thermodynamic identity x = &#8722;&#8706;G/&#8706;J, suggests the identi&#64257;cation 
G(N, T,J) = &#8722;kBT lnZ, (IV.88) 
where G = E &#8722;TS &#8722;x J is the Gibbs free energy . (The same conclusion can be reached &#183; 
by equating Zin eq.(IV.86) to the term that maximizes the probability with respect to 
x.) The enthalpy H &#8801;E &#8722;x J is easily obtained in this ensemble from &#183; 
&#8706;lnZ= x = H. (IV.89) &#8722; &#8706;&#946; &#65533;H &#8722; &#183; J&#65533;
Note that heat capacities at constant force (which include work done against the external forces), are obtained from the enthalpy as C
J = &#8706;H/&#8706;T .

The entropy is now given by 
&#8706;F &#65533;&#65533; &#65533; 
&#8722;&#491;/(kB T)&#65533;&#65533; &#491; &#65533; &#8722;&#491;/(kB T)eS = &#8722;&#8706;T &#65533;&#65533;

The internal energy, 
N&#491; E = F + TS = &#491;/(kB T) ,	 (IV.75) 1 +e
can also be obtained from 
&#8706;lnZ N&#491;e&#8722;&#946;&#491; 
E = &#8722; &#8706;&#946; =1 +e&#8722;&#946;&#491;.	 (IV.76) 
Since the joint probability in eq.(IV.71) is in the form of a product, the excitations of 
di&#64256;erent impurities are independent of each other, with the unconditional distribution 
&#8722;&#946;&#491;n ep(n) =1 +e&#8722;&#946;&#491; .	 (IV.77) 
This result coincides with eqs.(IV.25), obtained through a more elaborate analysis in the 
microcanonical ensemble. As expected, in the large N limit, the canonical and microcanon&#173;
ical ensembles describe exactly the same physics, both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels.

IV.I The Grand Canonical Ensemble 
The previous sections demonstrate that while the canonical and microcanonical en&#173;
sembles are completely equivalent in the thermodynamic limit, it is frequently much easier 
to perform statistical mechanical computations in the canonical framework. Sometimes 
it is more convenient to allow chemical work (by &#64257;xing the chemical potential &#181;, rather 
than at a &#64257;xed number of particles), but no mechanical work. The resulting macro-states M &#8801;(T, &#181;,x), are governed by the grand canonical ensemble. The corresponding micro&#173;
states &#181;
S, contain an inde&#64257;nite number of particles N(&#181;S). As in the case of the canonical 
ensemble, the system S, can be maintained at a constant chemical potential through contact

          <text>&#65533; &#65533; &#65533;&#65533; The following examples illustrate the use of the Gibbs canonical ensemble: 
1. The Ideal Gas in the isobaric ensemble is described by the macrostate M &#8801;(N, T, P ). 
A micro-state &#181;&#8801; {p &#65533;i,&#65533; qi}, with a volume V occurs with the probability 
&#65533; N 2 &#65533;&#65533; 1 for {q &#65533;i} &#8712;box of volume V

G = &#8722;kBT lnZ= NkBT lnP &#8722; ln(kBT) + ln . (IV.92) 2 2 2 &#960;m 
Starting from dG = &#8722;SdT +V dP + &#181;dN, the volume of the gas is obtained as 
&#8706;G &#65533;&#65533; NkBT V = &#65533; = , = P V = NkBT. (IV.93) &#8706;P &#65533;
T,N P &#8658; 
The enthalpy H = &#65533;E + PV&#65533;is easily calculated from 
&#8706;lnZ 5 NkBT, H = =&#8722; &#8706;&#946; 2 
from which we get CP = dH/dT = 5/2NkB. 
2. Spins in an external magnetic &#64257;eld B&#65533;, provide a common example for usage of the 
Gibbs canonical ensemble. Adding the work done against the magnetic &#64257;eld to the internal 
Hamiltonian H, results in the Gibbs partition function 
Z(N, T, B ) = tr exp &#8722;&#946;H+&#946;B&#65533;M&#65533;, &#183; 
where M&#65533;is the net magnetization. The symbol tr is used to indicate the sum over all 
spin degrees of freedom, which in a quantum mechanical formulation are restricted to 
discrete values. The simplest case is spin of 1/2, with two possible projections of the spin 
along the magnetic &#64257;eld. A microstate of N spins is now described by the set of Ising 
variables {&#963;i = &#177;1}. The corresponding magnetization along the &#64257;eld direction is given

quantities for an elastic collision: the particle number, the three components of the net

We shall refer to the above distribution as describing local equilibrium . While this form is 
preserved during collisions , it will evolve in time away from collisions , due to the streaming 
terms, unless {H1, f1} = 0. The latter condition is satis&#64257;ed for any function f1 that 
depends only on H1, or any other quantity that is conserved by it. Clearly, the above 
density satis&#64257;es this requirement as long as N, and &#946; are independent of /vector q, and &#945; /vector= 0. 
According to eq.(III.16), the appropriate normalization for f1 is 
d3/vector q f 1(/vector q) p d3/vector p,/vector = N. (III.54) 
For particles in a box of volume V, the potential U(/vector q) is zero inside the box, and in&#64257;nite

          <text>&#8226; Irreversibility: The second law is an empirical formulation of the vast number of everyday 
observations which support the existence of an arrow of time. Reconciling the reversibility 
of laws of physics governing the microscopic domain with the observed irreversibility of 
macroscopic phenomena is a fundamental problem. Of course, not all microscopic laws of physics are reversible: weak nuclear interactions violate time reversal symmetry, and 
the collapse of the quantum wave-function in the act of observation is irreversible. The 
former interactions in fact do not play any signi&#64257;cant role in everyday observations that lead to the second law. The irreversible collapse of the wave-function may itself be an artifact of treating macroscopic observers and microscopic observables distinctly.
&#8224; There 
are proponents of the view that the reversibility of the currently accepted microscopic 
equations of motion (classical or quantum) is indicative of their inadequacy. However, the 
advent of powerful computers has made it possible to simulate the evolution of collections of large numbers of particles, governed by classical, reversible equations of motion. Although 
simulations are currently limited to relatively small numbers of particles (10
6), they do 
exhibit the irreversible macroscopic behaviors similar to those observed in nature (typically involving 10
23 particles). For example, particles initially occupying one half of a box 
proceed to irreversibly, and uniformly, occupy the whole box. (This has nothing to do with limitations of computational accuracy; the same macroscopic irreversibility is observed in 
exactly reversible integer based simulations, such as with cellular automata.) Thus the 
origin of the observed irreversibilities should be sought in the classical evolution of large collections of particles. 
The Boltzmann equation is the &#64257;rst formula we have encountered that is clearly not 
time reversible, as indicated by eq.(III.49). We can thus ask the question of how we obtained this result from the Hamiltonian equations of motion. The key to this, of course, resides in the physically motivated approximations used to obtain eq.(III.41). The &#64257;rst steps of the approximation were dropping the three body collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.30), and the implicit coarse&#8211;graining of the resolution in the spatial and 
temporal scales. Neither of these steps explicitly violates time reversal symmetry, and the 
collision term in eq.(III.37) retains this property. The next step in getting to eq.(III.41) is to replace the two&#8211;body density f
2(&#8722;),evaluated before the collision , with the product of 
two one body densities according to eq.(III.32). This treats the two body densities before 
&#8224; The time dependent Schr&#168; odinger equation is fully time reversible. If it is possible 
to write a complicated wave-function that includes the observing apparatus (possibly the whole universe), it is hard to see how any irreversibility may occur.

/integraldisplay /integraldisplay /integraldisplay III.E The H&#8211;Theorem and Irreversibility 
The second question posed at the beginning of this chapter was whether a collection 
of particles naturally evolves towards an equilibrium state. While it is possible to obtain 
steady state solutions for the full phase space density &#961;N, because of time reversal sym&#173;
metry these solutions are not attractors of generic non-equilibrium densities. Does the 
unconditional one particle PDF &#961;1, su&#64256;er the same problem? While the exact density &#961;1 
must necessarily re&#64258;ect this property of &#961;N, the H&#8211;theorem proves that an approximate &#961;1, 
governed by the Boltzmann equation, does in fact non-reversibly approach an equilibrium 
form. This theorem states that: 
&#8226; If f1(/vector q, t) satis&#64257;es the Boltzmann equation, then dH/dt&#8804; 0, where p,/vector
H(t) = p d3/vector p,/vector p,/vector . d3/vector q f 1(/vector q, t) ln f1(/vector q, t) (III.42) 
The function H( t) is related to the information content of the one particle PDF. Up to an 
overall constant, the information content of &#961;1 = f1/N is given by I[&#961;1] = &#8733;an}bracketle{tln&#961;1&#8733;an}bracketri}ht, which 
is clearly similar to H( t). 
Proof: The time derivative of H is 
dH &#8706;f1 &#8706;f1 = d3p /vector1d3q /vector1 (lnf1 + 1) = d3p /vector1d3q /vector1 lnf1 , (III.43) dt &#8706;t &#8706;t 
since dV1f1 = N d&#915;&#961; = N is time independent. Using eq.(III.41), we obtain 
dH &#8706;U &#8706;f 1 p /vector1 &#8706;f1 = d3p /vector1d3q /vector1 lnf1 &#183; &#8722; &#183; dt &#8706;/vector q1 &#8706;/vector p1 m &#8706;/vector q 1

where we shall interchangeably use d2&#963;, d2/vectorb, or d2&#937;|d&#963;/d&#937;| for the di&#64256;erential cross-

          <text>and after the collision di&#64256;erently. We could have alternatively expressed eq.(III.37) in 
terms of the two body densities f2(+)evaluated after the collision. Replacing f2(+) with 
the product of two one particle densities would then lead to the opposite conclusion, with dH/dt &#8805; 0! For a system in equilibrium, it is hard to justify one choice over the other. 
However, once the system is out of equilibrium, the coordinates after the collision are more 
quite likely to be correlated, and hence the substitution of eq.(III.32) for f
2(+) does not 
make sense. Time reversal symmetry implies that there should also be subtle correlations in f
2(&#8722;) which are ignored in the so-called assumption of molecular chaos. 
While the assumption of molecular chaos before (but not after) collisions is the key 
to the irreversibility of the Boltzmann equation, the resulting loss of information is best 
justi&#64257;ed in terms of the coarse graining of space and time: The Liouville equation and 
its descendants contain precise information about the evolution of a pure state. This 
information, however, is inevitably transported to shorter scales. A useful image is that of mixing two immiscible &#64258;uids. While the two &#64258;uids remain distinct at each point, the 
transitions in space from one to the next occur at &#64257;ner resolution on subsequent mixing. 
At some point, a &#64257;nite resolution in any measuring apparatus will prevent keeping track 
of the two components. In the Boltzmann equation the precise information of the pure 
state is lost at the scale of collisions. The resulting one body density only describes space 
and time resolutions longer than those of a two-body collision, becoming more and more 
probabilistic as further information is lost. 
III.F Equilibrium Properties 
What is the nature of the equilibrium state described by f1, for a homogeneous gas? 
(1) The equilibrium distribution: After the gas has reached equilibrium, the function H 
should no longer decrease with time. Since the integrand in eq.(III.48) is always positive, 
a necessary condition for dH/dt= 0 is that 
f1(p /vector1,/vector q1)f1(p /vector2,/vector q1)&#8722;f1(p /vector1 &#8242; ,/vector q1)f1(p /vector2 &#8242; ,/vector q1) = 0, (III.50) 
i.e. at each point /vector q, we must have 
lnf1(p /vector1,/vector q) + ln f1(p /vector2,/vector q) = ln f1(p /vector1 &#8242; ,/vector q) + ln f1(p /vector2 &#8242; ,/vector q). (III.51) 
The left hand side of the above equation refers to the momenta before a two-body collision, 
and the right hand side to the those after the collision. The equality is thus satis&#64257;ed by

/bracketleftbigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg The &#64257;nal factor in the above expression is the volume of a cylinder of height vx&#948;t per&#173;
pendicular to the area element A. Only particles within this cylinder are close enough to 
impact the wall during &#948;t. As each collision imparts a momentum 2 px to the wall, the net

As only particles with velocities directed towards the wall will hit it, the &#64257;rst integral is 
over half of the range of px. Since the integrand is even in px, this restriction can be 
removed by dividing the full integral by 2. The pressure P is then obtained from the force 
per unit area as

where eq.(III.56) is used for the equilibrium form of f1. Comparing with the standard 
equation of state, PV = NkBT, for an ideal gas, leads to the identi&#64257;cation, &#946; = 1/kBT. 
(4)Entropy: As discussed earlier, the Boltzmann H-function is closely related to the infor&#173;
mation content of the one-particle PDF &#961;1. We can also de&#64257;ne a corresponding Boltzmann 
entropy, 
SB(t) = &#8722;kBH(t), (III.65) 
where the constant kB re&#64258;ects the historical origins of entropy. The H-theorem implies that 
SB can only increase with time in approaching equilibrium. It has the further advantage 
of being de&#64257;ned through eq.(III.42) for situations that are clearly out of equilibrium. For 
a gas in equilibrium in a box of volume V, from eq.(III.56), we compute

dH 1 = &#8722; d3/vector qd3p /vector1d3p /vector2d2/vectorb|/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2|[f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)&#8722;f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; )]ln(f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)). dt 2 
(III.45) 
(The arguments, /vector q and t, of f1 are suppressed for ease of notation.) We would now like 
to change the variables of integrations from the coordinates describing the initiators of the collision, ( p /vector
1, /vector p2,/vectorb), to those of their products, (p /vector 1 &#8242; , /vector p2 &#8242; ,/vectorb &#8242; ). The explicit functional 
forms describing this transformation are complicated because of the dependence of the 
solid angle &#710; on /vector p2 &#8722;p /vector1|. However, we are assured that the Jacobian &#937; in eq.(III.39) b and |/vector
of the transformation is unity because of time reversal symmetry; since for every collision 
there is an inverse one obtained by reversing the momenta of the products. In terms of 
the new coordinates 
dH 1 = &#8722; d3qd /vector3p /vector1 &#8242; d3p /vector2 &#8242; d2/vectorb &#8242; |/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2|[f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)&#8722;f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; )]ln (f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)),dt 2 
(III.46) 
where we should now regard ( p /vector1, /vector p2) in the above equation, as functions of the integration 
variables ( p /vector1 &#8242; , /vector p2 &#8242; ,/vectorb &#8242; ) as in eq.(III.39). As noted earlier, |/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2| = |/vector v1 &#8242; &#8722;/vector v2 &#8242; | for any 
elastic collision, and we can use these quantities interchangeably. Finally, we relabel the dummy integration variables such that the primes are removed. Noting that the functional 
dependence of ( p /vector
1, /vector p2,/vectorb) on ( p /vector1 &#8242; , /vector p2 &#8242; ,/vectorb &#8242; ) is exactly the same as its inverse, we obtain 
dH 1 = &#8722; d3/vector qd3p /vector1d3p /vector2d2/vectorb|/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2|[f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; )&#8722;f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)]ln (f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; )). dt 2 
(III.47) 
Averaging eqs.(III.45) and (III.47) results in 
dH 1 = &#8722; d3/vector qd3p /vector1d3p /vector2d2/vectorb|/vector v1 &#8722;/vector v2|[f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)&#8722;f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; )] dt 4 (III.48) 
[ln(f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2))&#8722;ln (f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; ))]. 
The integrand of the above expression is always positive. If f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2)&gt; f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; ), 
both terms in square brackets are positive, while both are negative if f1(p /vector1)f1(p /vector2) &lt; 
f1(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(p /vector2 &#8242; ). In either case, their product is positive. The positivity of the integrand 
establishes the validity of the H&#8211;theorem,

Stationary distributions can be obtained if all six terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.59) 
are zero. In the absence of inter-species collisions, i.e. for Ca,b = Cb,a, we can obtain 
independent stationary distributions f1(a) &#8733; exp &#8722;&#946;aH(

Requiring the vanishing of Ca,b leads to the additional constraint, 
f1(a)(p /vector1)f1(b)(p /vector2)&#8722;f1(a)(p /vector1 &#8242; )f1(b)(p /vector2 &#8242; ) = 0, =&#8658;

Since the total energy H(

is conserved in a collision, the above equation can be 
satis&#64257;ed for &#946;a = &#946;b = &#946;. From eq.(III.57) this condition implies the equality of the kinetic

&#65533; V. Interacting Particles
V.A T he C umulant  E xpansion 
The examples studied in the previous section involve non-interacting particles. It is 
precisely the lack of interactions that renders these problems exactly solvable. Interactions, 
however, are responsible for the wealth of interesting materials and phases observed in 
nature. We would thus like to understand the role of interactions amongst particles, and 
learn how to treat them in statistical mechanics. For a general Hamiltonian, 
N 2 
HN = &#65533; p &#65533;i +U(&#65533; q1,&#183; &#183; &#183; ,&#65533; qN ), (V.1) 2m i=1 
the partition function can be written as 
&#65533; N &#65533; &#65533; 1 &#65533; d3p &#65533;id3q &#65533;i &#65533; p &#65533;i 2 
Z(T, V, N ) = exp &#8722;&#946; exp[&#8722;&#946;U(&#65533; q1,&#183; &#183; &#183; ,&#65533; qN )] N! h3 2m (V.2) i=1 i

where Z0(T, V, N ) = &#65533; 
V/&#955;3 &#65533;N /N! is the partition function of the ideal g as  ( eq.(IV.73)), 
0and /an}bracketle{tO/an}bracketri}htdenotes the expectation value of O computed with the probability distribution of 
the non-interacting system. In terms of the cumulants of the random variable U, eq.(V.2) 
can be recast as &#8734; &#65533; &#65533; 0 
lnZ = lnZ0 + &#65533; (&#8722;&#946;)&#8467; 
U&#8467; . (V.3) &#8467;! c &#8467;=1 
The cumulants are related to the moments by the relations in section II.B. Since U depends 
only on {&#65533; qi}which are uniformly and independently  d istributed within the box of volume 
V, the moments are given by 
&#65533; N 
U&#8467; &#65533;0

The simplest system for treating interactions is again the dilute gas. As discussed in 
chapter II, for a weakly interacting gas we can specialize to 
U(&#65533; q1,&#183; &#183; &#183; ,&#65533; qN ) = V(q &#65533;i &#8722;&#65533; qj ), (V.8) 
i&lt;j 
where V(&#65533; qi &#8722;&#65533; qj ) is a pair-wise interaction between particles. The &#64257;rst correction in eq.(V.3) 
is &#65533; d3&#65533; qi d3q &#65533;j 0/an}bracketle{tU/an}bracketri}ht= V(&#65533; qi &#8722;q &#65533;j )c V V i&lt;j (V.9) 
= N(N &#8722;1) d3q &#65533;V(&#65533; q). 2V 
The &#64257;nal result is obtained by performing the integrals over the relative and center of mass 
coordinates of &#65533; qi and q &#65533;j separately. (Each of the N(N &#8722; 1)/2 pairs makes an identical 
contribution.) 
The second order correction, 
U2&#65533;0 = /an}bracketle{tV(q &#65533;i &#8722;&#65533; qj )V(q &#65533;k &#8722;&#65533; ql)/an}bracketri}ht0 &#8722; /an}bracketle{tV(&#65533; qi &#8722;q &#65533;j )/an}bracketri}ht0 /an}bracketle{tV(q &#65533;k &#8722;&#65533; ql)/an}bracketri}ht0 , (V.10) c

is the sum of [ N(N &#8722;1)/2]2 terms that can be grouped as follows: 
(i) Th ere is no contribution from terms in which the four indices {i, j, k, l }are di&#64256;erent. 
0This is because the di&#64256;erent {&#65533; qi}are independently distributed and /an}bracketle{tV(q &#65533;i &#8722;&#65533; qj )V(q &#65533;k &#8722;&#65533; ql)/an}bracketri}ht

(ii) Th ere is one common index between the two pairs, e.g. {(i, j),(i, l)}. By changing 
0coordinates to &#65533; qij = &#65533; qi &#8722;q &#65533;j and q &#65533;il = q &#65533;i &#8722;&#65533; ql, it again follows that /an}bracketle{tV(q &#65533;i &#8722;&#65533; qj )V(q &#65533;i &#8722;&#65533; ql)/an}bracketri}ht

translational  s ymmetry of the problem in the absence of an external potential.

&#65533; the value of such a diagram is the product of its disjoint fragments. It can be shown that 
such diagrams are also cancelled out in calculating the cumulant. Thus only one particle  
i
rreducible  c lusters survive in this cumulant expansion. A cluster with ns sites and &#8467; bonds 
s makes a contribution of order of N(N/V)n&#8722;1(&#946;V)&#8467; to lnZ. 
Ignoring terms of order of 1/N , the cumulant expansion leads to a corrected free 
energy, 
N2 &#65533;&#946; &#65533; &#65533;&#65533; 
F(T, V, N ) = F0(T, V, N )+ d3&#65533; qV(q &#65533;)&#8722; d3&#65533; qV(q &#65533;)2 + O &#946;2V3
2V 2 
&#65533; &#65533;  ( V.12) 
N3&#946;2V3 
+ O . V2 
From this expression we can proceed to calculate other modi&#64257;ed state functions, e.g. P = 
&#8722; &#8706;F/&#8706;V |T,N . Unfortunately, the expansion in powers of &#946;V is not particularly useful. 
The inter-atomic potential V(&#65533; r ) for most particles has an attractive tail due to van der 
Waals interactions that decays as &#8722;1/r6 at large separations r = |&#65533; r |. At short distances 
the overlap of the electron clouds makes the potential strongly repulsive. Typically there 
is a minimum of depth a few hundred degrees Kelvin, at a distance of a few angstroms. 
The in&#64257;nity in V(&#65533; r ) at short distances makes it an unsuitable expansion parameter. This 
problem can be alleviated by a partial resummation of diagrams. For example, to get the 
correction at order of N2/V, we need to sum over all two point clusters, independent of 
the number of bonds. The resulting sum is actually quite trivial, and leads to 
&#8734; &#65533; &#65533; &#65533;  &#65533; (&#8722;&#946;)n N(N &#8722;1) d3q &#65533; N3 
lnZ = lnZ0 + V(&#65533; q)n +O 2 n! 2 V Vn=1 (V.13) 
= lnZ0 + N(N &#8722;1) d3&#65533; q[exp ( &#8722;&#946;V(q &#65533;))&#8722;1] +O &#65533; N3 &#65533; 
. 2V V2 
The quantity f(&#65533; q) = exp( &#8722;&#946;V(q &#65533;))&#8722;1 is a much more convenient expansion parameter 
which goes to &#8722;1 at short distances and rapidly vanishes for large separations. In the next 
section we shall recast the perturbative expansion in terms of this quantity.

&#65533; (iii) In the remaining N(N &#8722;1)/2 terms the pairs are identical, resulting in
&#65533; 
U2&#65533;0 = N(N &#8722;1) &#65533; d3q &#65533;V(q &#65533;)2 &#8722; &#65533;&#65533; d3&#65533; qV(q &#65533;) &#65533;2 
. (V.11) c 2 V V 
The second term in the above equation is smaller by a factor of d3/V, where d is a 
characteristic range for the potential V. For any reasonable potential that decays with 
distance, this term vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. 
Similar groupings occur for higher order terms in this cumulant expansion . It is helpful 
to visualize the terms in the expansion diagrammatically as follows: 
(a) For a term of order &#8467;, draw &#8467; pairs of points (representing q &#65533;i and &#65533; qj ) connected 
by bonds, representing the interaction Vij &#8801; V(&#65533; qi &#8722; q &#65533;j ). An overall factor of 1/&#8467; ! 
accompanies such graphs. 
(b) By multiple selections of the same index i, two or more bonds can be joined together 
forming a diagram of interconnected points. There is a factor S&#8467; associated with the 
number of ways of assigning labels 1 through N to the di&#64256;erent points of the graph. 
Ignoring the di&#64256;erences between N, N &#8722; 1, etc., a diagram with ns points makes 
s a contribution proportional to Nn. There is typically also division by a symmetry 
factor  wh ich takes into account the number of equivalent assignments. For example, 
the diagrams involving a pair of points, calculated in eqs.(V.9) and (V.11), have a 
symmetry factor of 1/2. 
(c) Apart from these numerical prefactors, the contribution of a diagram is an integral R&#8467; 
over all the ns coordinates &#65533; qi, of products of corresponding Vij . If the graphs has nc 
disconnected c lusters , integration over the center of mass coordinates of the clusters 
c gives a factor of Vn.
Fortunately, many cancellations occur in calculating cumulants. In particular:
&#8226; When calculating the moment U&#8467; &#65533;0 , the contribution of a disconnected d iagram i s sim&#173;
ply the product of its disjoint clusters . The coordinates of these clusters are independent 
random variables, and make no contribution to the joint cumulant &#65533; 
U&#8467; &#65533;0 . This result also c 
ensures the extensivity of ln Z, as the surviving connected diagrams give a factor of V 
from their center of mass integration. (Disconnected clusters have more factors of V, and 
are non-extensive.) 
&#8226; There are also one particle  r educible c lusters which are fully connected, yet fall to disjoint 
fragments if a single  c oordinate point is removed. By measuring all other coordinates 
relative to this special point, it can be seen that (in a translationally invariant system)

The above result has the simple geometrical interpretation that the sum over all graphs, 
connected or not, equals the exponential of the sum over connected graphs. This is a 
quite general result that is also related to the graphical connection between moments and cumulants discussed in sec.II.B. 
The grand potential is now obtained from

In eq.(V.25), the extensivity condition is used to get G = E &#8722;TS &#8722;&#181;N = &#8722;PV. Thus 
the terms on the right hand side of the above equation must also be proportional to the volume V. This can be explicitly veri&#64257;ed by noting that in evaluating each b

As the above example indicates, the value of each graph is the product of the contri&#173;
butions from its linked clusters . Since these clusters are more fundamental, we reformulate 
the sum in terms of them by de&#64257;ning a quantity b&#8467;, equal to the sum over all &#8467;-particle 
linked clusters (one-particle irreducible or not). For example 
b1 = &#8226; = d3&#65533; q = V, (V.18) 
and 
b2 = &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; = d3q &#65533;1d3&#65533; q2f(q &#65533;1 &#8722;q &#65533;2). (V.19) 
There are four diagrams contributing to b3, leading to

A given N-particle graph can be decomposed to n1 1-clusters, n2 2-clusters, &#183; &#183; &#183;, n&#8467; &#8467;&#173;
clusters, etc. Hence, 
SN = b&#8467;n&#8467; W({n&#8467;}), (V.21) 
{n&#8467;}&#8242; &#8467; 
where the restricted sum is over all distinct divisions of N points into a set of clusters {n&#8467;}, 
such that &#8467; &#8467;n&#8467; = N. The coe&#64259;cients W({n&#8467;}) are the number of ways of assigning N 
particle labels to groups of n&#8467; &#8467;-clusters. For example, the divisions of 3 particles into a 
1-cluster and a 2-cluster are 
&#8226; &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; , , and . 1 2 3 2 1 3 3 2 1 
All above graphs have n1 = 1 and n2 = 1, and contribute a factor of b1b2 to S3; thus 
W(1,1) = 3. 
In general, W({n&#8467;}) is the number of distinct ways of grouping the labels 1 , . . ., N 
into bins of n&#8467; &#8467;-clusters. It can be obtained from the total number of permutations, N!, 
after dividing by the number of equivalent assignments. Within each bin of &#8467;n&#8467; particles, 
equivalent assignments are obtained by: (i) permuting the &#8467; labels in each subgroup in &#8467;!

The above example demonstrates the cancellation of the one particle reducible cluster 
that appears in b3. While all clusters (reducible or not) appear in the sum for b&#8467;, as 
demonstrated in the previous section, only the one particle irreducible ones can appear in 
an expansion in powers of density. The &#64257;nal expression for the &#8467;th virial coe&#64259;cient is 
(&#8467;&#8722;1) B&#8467;(T) = &#8722; d&#175;&#8467;, (V.35) &#8467;! 
where d&#175;&#8467; is de&#64257;ned as the sum over all one&#8211;particle&#8211;irreducible clusters of &#8467; points. Note 
that in terms of d&#175;&#8467;, the partition function can be organized as

For short range interactions, specially with a hard core, it is much better to replace 
the expansion parameter V(&#65533; q) byf(q &#65533;) = exp ( &#8722;&#946;V(&#65533; q))&#8722;1, which is obtained by summing 
over all possible number of bonds between two points on a cumulant graph. The resulting 
series is organized in powers of the density N/V, and is most suitable for obtaining a virial 
expansion, which expresses the deviations from the ideal gas equation of state in a power 
series /bracketleftBigg /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg2 /bracketrightBigg

The temperature dependent parameters, Bi(T), are known as the virial coe&#64259;cients and 
originate from the inter-particle interactions. Our initial goal is to compute these coe&#64259;&#173;cients from &#64257;rst principles. 
To illustrate a di&#64256;erent method of expansion, we shall perform computations in the 
grand canonical ensemble. With a macro-state M &#8801; (T, &#181;, V ), the grand partition function 
is given by 
&#8734;	 &#8734; /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg N /summationdisplay /summationdisplay 1 e&#946;&#181; 
Q(&#181;, T, V ) = e&#946;&#181;NZ(N, T, V ) = SN, (V.15) N! &#955;3 
N=0	 N= 0 
where /integraldisplay N 
SN = d3&#65533; qi (1 +fij), (V.16) 
i=1 i &lt;j 
and fij = f(&#65533; qi &#8722;q &#65533;j). 
The 2N(N&#8722;1)/2 terms in SN can now be ordered in powers of fij as 
&#63723;	 &#63734; /integraldisplay N 
SN = d3&#65533; qi &#63725;1 + fij + fijfkl +&#183; &#183; &#183; &#63736; . ( V.17) 
i=1 i &lt;j i&lt;j,k&lt;l 
An e&#64259;cient method for organizing the perturbation series is to represent the various con&#173;
tributions diagrammatically. In particular we shall apply the following conventions: 
(a)	D raw N dots labelled by i = 1,&#183; &#183; &#183; , N to represent the coordinates &#65533; q1 through &#65533; qN, 
&#183; &#183; &#183; . 1 2 N 
(b)	E ach term in eq.(V.17) corresponds to a product of fij, represented by drawing lines 
connecting i and j for each fij. For example, the graph, 
&#8226; &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; &#8722; &#8226; &#8226; &#183; &#183; &#183; ,1 2 3 4 5 6 N

b2 = /integraltext 
d3&#65533; q1d3&#65533; q2f(&#65533; q1 &#8722;q &#65533;2) = V /integraltext 
d3&#65533; q12f(q &#65533;12). Quite generally, we can set 
lim b&#8467; = V b&#175;&#8467;, (V.26) 
V&#8594;&#8734; 
and the pressure is now obtained from 
&#8734; /parenleftbigg /parenrightbigg &#8467; P /summationdisplay e&#946;&#181; b&#175;&#8467; = . (V.27) kT &#955;3 &#8467;! &#8467;=1 
The linked cluster theorem ensures G &#8733; V, since if any non-linked cluster had appeared in 
lnQ, it would have contributed a higher power of V. 
Although an expansion for the gas pressure, eq.(V.27) is quite di&#64256;erent from eq.(V.14) 
in that it involves powers of e&#946;&#181; rather than the density n = N/V. This di&#64256;erence can be 
removed by solving for the density in terms of the chemical potential, using 
&#8734; &#946;&#181; /parenrightbigg&#8467; &#8706;lnQ /summationdisplay e Vb &#175;&#8467;N = = &#8467; . (V.28) &#8706;(&#946;&#181;) &#955;3 &#8467;! &#8467;=1 
The equation of state can be obtained by eliminating the fugacity x = e&#946;&#181;/&#955;3, between 
the equations 
&#8734; &#8734; x&#8467; P /summationdisplay x&#8467;

using the following steps: 
(a) S olve for x(n) from ( b&#175;1 = /integraltext 
d3&#65533; q/V = 1) 
x = n &#8722;b&#175;2x 2 &#8722; b&#175;3 x 3 &#8722; &#183; &#183; &#183; . (V.30) 2 
The perturbative solution at each order is obtained by substituting the solution at the 
previous order in eq.(V.30), 
x1 = n +O(n 2) 
x2 = n &#8722;b&#175;2n 2 +O(n 3) (V.31) 
x3 = n &#8722;b&#175;2(n &#8722;b&#175;2n)2 &#8722; b&#175;3 n 3 +O(n 4) = n &#8722;b&#175;2n 2 + (2b&#175;22 &#8722; b&#175;3 )n 3 +O(n 4). 2 2
