x 2Eventhough e&#8722;tdt isn&#8217;t an elementary function, we can still compute it. Elementary functions 
0 are still a little bit better, though. For example: 
sin x = x &#8722; x

Buttocompute sin(&#960;/2) numerically is a waste of time. We know that the sum if something very 
simple,namely, &#960;sin =1 2 
It&#8217;s not obvious from the series expansion that sin x deals with angles. Series are sometimes com&#173;
plicated andunintuitive. 
&#960; &#960;Nevertheless, we can read this formula backwards to &#64257;nd a formula for . Start with sin =1.2 2 Then, &#65533; 1 dx &#65533;&#65533;1 &#960;&#960;

Now, you&#8217;re all probably wondering: who on earth bets on particle decays? 
In truth, no one does. There is, however, a very similar problem that is useful in the real world. 
There is something called an annuity, which is basically a retiremen t pension. You can buy an 
annuity, and then get paid a certain amount every month once you retire. Once you die, the annuity 
paymentsstop. 
You(andthepeoplepayingyou)naturally careabouthowmuchmoneyyoucanexpecttoget 
over the course of your retiremen t. In this case, f(t)= t representshowmuchmoneyyouendup 
with,and w(t)= e&#8722;kt representshowlikelyyouraretobealiveafter t years. 
What if you want a 2-life annuity? Then, you need multiple integrals, which you will learn about 
inmultivariablecalculus (18.02). 
Our &#64257;rst goal in this class was to be able to di&#64256;erentiate anything. In multivariable calculus, you 
will learn about another chain rule. That chain rule will unify the (single-variable) chain rule, the 
productrule,thequotientrule,andimplicitdi&#64256;erentiation.

So, implicit di&#64256;eren tiation makes it possible to &#64257;nd the deriv ative of the inverse function. 
Example. y = arctan( x) 
tan y = x 
d 
dx [tan(y )] = dx 
dx = 1 
d 
dy [tan(y )] 
&#65533; 1 
cos2(y) &#65533; dy

dx = 
= 1 1 
dy 
dx = cos2(y) = cos2(arctan(x)) 
This form is messy . Let us use some geometry to simplif y it.

Figure 1: Triangle with angles and lengths corresp onding to those in the example illustrating di&#64256;eren tiation using 
the inverse function arctan 
In this triangle, tan(y )= x so
arctan( x)= y
The Pythagorian theorem tells us the length of the hypotenuse: 
h = 1+ x2 
From this, we can &#64257;nd 
1cos(y )= &#8730;
1+ x2 
From this, we get &#65533;&#65533;21 1 cos2(y)= =&#8730;

Implicit Di&#64256;eren tiation 
dExample 1. (x a)= ax a&#8722;1 . dx We proved this by an explicit compu tation for a =0, 1, 2,.... From this, we also got the formula for 
a = &#8722;1, &#8722;2,.... Let us try to extend this formula to cover rational numbers, as well: 
m m a = ; y = xn where m and n are integers. n 
We want to compute dy . We can say yn = xm so nyn&#8722;1 dy = mx m&#8722;1 . Solve for dy : dx dx dx 
dy = mxm&#8722;1 
dx nyn&#8722;1 
( m 
We know that y = xn ) is a function of x. 
dy = mxm&#8722;1 
dx nyn&#8722;1 
m xm&#8722;1 
= n (xm/n)n&#8722;1 
mxm&#8722;1 
= nxm(n&#8722;1)/n 
= x(m&#8722;1)&#8722; m(n
n &#8722;1) m 
n 
m n(m&#8722;1)&#8722;m(n&#8722;1) 
= x n n 
m nm&#8722;n&#8722;nm+m 
= x n n 
m m n 
= x n &#8722; n n 
dy m m 
So, = x n &#8722; 1 
dx n 
This is the same answer as we were hoping to get! 
Example 2. Equation of a circle with a radius of 1: x2 +y2 = 1 which we can write as y2 =1&#8722;x2 . 
So y = &#177;&#8730;
1 &#8722; x2. Let us look at the positiv e case: 
&#65533; 1
y = +1 &#8722; x2 = (1 &#8722; x 2) 2
dy = 1(1 &#8722; x 2) &#8722;

Now, let&#8217;s do the same thing, using implicit di&#64256;eren tiation. 
x 2 + y 2 =1 
d &#65533; 2&#65533; d x 2 + y = (1)=0 dx dx 
d d(x 2)+ (y 2)=0 dx dx 
Applying chain rule in the second term, 
2x +2ydy =0 dx 
2ydy = &#8722;2x dx 
dy = &#8722;x 
dx y 
Same answ er! 
Example 3. y3 + xy2 + 1 = 0. In this case, it&#8217;s not easy to solve for y as a function of x. Instead, 
we use implicit di&#64256;eren tiation to &#64257;nd dy . dx 
3y 2 dy + y 2 +2xydy =0 dx dx 
We can now solve for dy in terms of y and x. dx 
dy 
dx (3y 2 +2xy)= &#8722;y 2 
dy = &#8722;y2 
dx 3y2 +2xy 
Inverse Functions 
If y = f(x) and g(y)= x, we call g the inverse function of f, f&#8722;1: 
x = g(y)= f&#8722;1(y) 
Now, let us use implicit di&#64256;eren tiation to &#64257;nd the deriv ative of the inverse function . 
y = f(x) 
f&#8722;1(y)= x 
d d(f&#8722;1(y))= (x)=1 dx	 dx
By the chain rule: 
d dy(f&#8722;1(y)) =1 dy dx 
and
d 1
(f&#8722;1(y)) = dy	 dy 
dx

So, 
dy = 1 
dx 1 + x2 
In other words, 
d 1arctan( x)= dx 1+ x2 
Graphing an Inverse Function. 
Supp ose y = f(x) and g(y)= f&#8722;1(y)= x. To graph g and f together we need to write g as a 
function of the variable x. If g(x)= y, then x = f(y), and what we have done is to trade the 
variables x and y. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 
f&#8722;1(f(x)) = x f&#8722;1 f(x)= x&#9702; 
f(f&#8722;1(x)) = x ff&#8722;1(x)= x&#9702;

1. Draw the picture. 
2. Figure out what variables to use. (In this case, r, h, V and surface area, S.) 
3. Figure out what the constrain ts are in the problem, and express them using a formula. In this 
example, the constrain t is 
V = &#960;r2h = constan t 
We&#8217;re also looking for the surface area. So we need the formula for that, too: 
S = &#960;r2 + (2&#960;r)h
Now, in symbols, the problem is to minimize S with V constan t.

Lecture 11: Max/Min Problems 
Example 1. y = ln x (same function as in last lecture) x 
x0=e1/e
Figure 1: Graph of y = ln x . x 
1What is the maxim um value? Answ er: y =. &#8226; e 
&#8226; Where (or at what point) is the maxim um achieved? Answ er: x = e. (See Fig. 1).) 
Beware: Some people will ask &#8220;What is the maxim um?&#8221;. The answ er is not e. You will get so used 
to &#64257;nding the critical point x = e, the main calculus step, that you will forget to &#64257;nd the maxim um 
1 1value y = . Both the critical point x = e and critical value y = are importan t. Together, they e e1form the point of the graph (e, ) where it turns around. e 
Example 2. Find the max and the min of the function in Fig. 2 
Answ er: If you&#8217;ve already graphed the function, it&#8217;s obvious where the maxim um and minim um 
values are. The point is to &#64257;nd the maxim um and minim um without sketching the whole graph. 
Idea : Look for the max and min among the critical points and endp oints.You can see from Fig. 2 
that we only need to compare the heigh ts or y-values corresp onding to endpoints and critical points. 
(Watch out for discon tinuities!)

          <text>&#65533; &#65533; 4. Use the constrain t equation to express everything in terms of r (and the constan t V ). 
h = V ; S = &#960;r2 + (2&#960;r) V 
2&#960;r &#960;r2 
5. Find the critical points (solve dS/dr = 0), as well as the endp oints. S will achieve its max and 
min at one of these places. 
dS 2V 3 V &#65533; V &#65533;1/3 
dr =2&#960;r &#8722; r2 =0 = &#8658; &#960;r3 &#8722; V =0 = &#8658; r = &#960; = &#8658; r = &#960; 
We&#8217;re not done yet. We&#8217;ve still got to evaluate S at the endp oints: r =0 and &#8220;r = &#8734;&#8221;. 
2V S = &#960;r2 + , 0 &#8804; r&lt; &#8734;r 
2As r &#8594; 0, the second term, r , goes to in&#64257;nit y, so S &#8594;&#8734;. As r &#8594;&#8734;, the &#64257;rst term &#960;r2 goes 
to in&#64257;nit y, so S &#8594;&#8734;. Since S =+&#8734; at each end, the minim um is achieved at the critical point 
r =(V/&#960;)1/3, not at either endp oint.

Figure 4: Graph of S 
We&#8217;re still not done. We want to &#64257;nd the minim um value of the surface area, S, and the values 
of h. &#65533;&#65533;1/3 &#65533;&#65533;&#8722;2/3 &#65533;&#65533;1/3V VVVV V r = &#960; ; h = &#960;r2 =

S = &#960;r2 +2 V = &#960;V +2VV =3&#960;&#8722;1/3V 2/3 
r&#960; &#960; 
Finally , another, often better, way of answ ering that question is to &#64257;nd the proportions of the 
can. In other words, what is h 
r ? Answ er: h 
r = (V/&#960;)1/3 
(V/&#960;)1/3 = 1.

          <text>By checking the endp oints in Fig. 6, we see that the minimum area was achieved at x = 1

The maxim um area is not achieved in 0 &lt;x&lt; 1, but it is achieved at x = 0 or 1. The maxim um 
corresp onds to using the whole length of wire for one square.

Moral: Don&#8217;t forget endpoints. If you only look at critical points you may &#64257;nd the worst answer, 
rather than the best one.

Lecture 13: Newton&#8217;s Metho d and Other Applications 
Newton&#8217;s Metho d 
Newton&#8217;s metho d is a powerful tool for solving equations of the form f(x) = 0. 
Example 1. f(x)= x2 &#8722; 3. In other words, solve x2 &#8722; 3 = 0. We already know that the solution 
to this is x = &#8730;
3. Newton&#8217;s metho d, gives a good numerical appro ximation to the answ er. The 
metho d uses tangent lines (see Fig. 1). 
x0=1 x1
(1,-2)y = x2 -3
Figure 1: Illustration of Newton&#8217;s Metho d, Example 1. 
The goal is to &#64257;nd where the graph crosses the x-axis. We start with a guess of x0 = 1. Plugging 
that back into the equation for y, we get y0 =12 &#8722; 3= &#8722;2, which isn&#8217;t very close to 0. 
Our next guess is x1, where the tangen t line to the function at x 0 crosses the x-axis. The equation 
for the tangen t line is: 
y &#8722; y0 = m(x &#8722; x0) 
When the tangen t line intercepts the x-axis, y = 0, so 
&#8722;y0 = m(x 1 &#8722; x0) 
y0 &#8722; m = x1 &#8722; x0 
y0 x1 = x0 &#8722; m 
Remem ber: m is the slope of the tangen t line to y = f(x) at the point (x0,y0).

          <text>&#65533; &#65533; From Fig. 6, we see that the last equation can be interpreted geometrically as saying that 
sin &#945; = sin &#946; 
where &#945; and &#946; are the angles the left and right portions of the string make with the vertical. 
Physical and geometric conclusions 
The angles &#945; and &#946; are equal. Using vectors to compute the force exerted by gravity on the two 
halves of the string, one &#64257;nds that there is equal tension in the two halves of the string -a physical 
equilibrium. (From another point of view, the equal angle property expresses a geometric property 
of ellipses: Supp ose that the ellipse is a mirror. A ray of light from the focus (0, 0) re&#64258;ects o&#64256; the 
mirror according to the rule angle of incidence equals angle of re&#64258;ection, and therefore the ray goes 
directly to the other focus at (a,b).) 
Formulae for x and y 
We did not yet &#64257;nd the location of (x,y). We will now show that 
&#65533; &#65533; &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; a b 1 x =2 1 &#8722;&#8730;
L2 &#8722; a2 ,y =2 b &#8722; L2 &#8722; a2 
Because &#945; = &#946;, &#65533; &#65533; 
x = x2 + y2 sin &#945;; a &#8722; x =(x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2 sin &#945; 
Adding these two equations, 
&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; &#65533; a a = x2 + y2 +(x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2 sin &#945; = L sin &#945; = &#8658; sin &#945; = L 
The equations for the vertical legs of the right triangles are (note that y&lt; 0): 
&#8722;y = x2 + y2 cos &#945;; b &#8722; y =(x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2 cos &#946; 
Adding these two equations, and using &#945; = &#946;, 
&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; &#65533; 1 b &#8722; 2y = x2 + y2 +(x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2 cos &#945; = L cos &#945; = &#8658; y = 2(b &#8722; L cos &#945;) 
aUse the relation sin &#945; = to write L cos &#945; = L &#65533; 
1 &#8722; sin2 &#945; = &#8730;
L2 &#8722; a2. Then the formula for y is L 
1 &#65533;&#65533; &#65533; 
y =2 b &#8722; L2 &#8722; a2 
Finally , to &#64257;nd the formula for x, use the similar right triangles 
tan &#945; = x = a &#8722; x = x(b &#8722; y)=(&#8722;y)(a &#8722; x)= (b &#8722; 2y)x = &#8722;ay &#8722;yb &#8722; y &#8658; &#8658; 
Therefore, &#65533; &#65533; 
x = = b &#8722;
&#8722; ay 
2ya

L2 b 
&#8722; a2 
Thus we have formulae for x and y in terms of a, b and L. 
I omitted the deriv ation of the formulae for x and y in lecture because it is long and because we 
got all of our physical intuition and understanding out of the problem from the balance condition 
that was the immediate consequence of the critical point computation. 
Final Remark. In 18.02, you will learn to treat constrained max/min problems in any number 
of variables using a metho d called Lagrange multipliers.

Summary 
Newton&#8217;s Metho d is illustrated in Fig. 3 and can be summarized as follows: 
f(xk) xk+1 = xk &#8722; f&#65533;(xk) 
xk = kth iterate(xk, yk)
xk+1y=f(x)

f(xk) 1 3 xk+1 = xk &#8722; f&#65533;(xk)= ... =2xk +2xk

x = lim xk (xk &#8594; x as k &#8594;&#8734;)

1 3 x1 = x0 +2 2x0 
The main idea is to repeat (iterate) this process: 
1 3 x2 = x1 +2 2x1 
1 3 x3 = x2 +2 2x2

Consider a ring on a string 1 held &#64257;xed at two ends at (0, 0) and (a,b) (see Fig. 6). The ring is 
free to slide to any point. Find the position (x,y) of the string.

Figure 6: Illustration of the Ring on a String problem. 
Physical Principle The ring settles at the lowest heigh t (lowest potential energy), so the prob&#173;
lem is to minimize y subject to the constrain t that (x,y) is on the string. 
Constrain t The length L of the string is &#64257;xed: 
x2 + y2 +(x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2 = L 
The function y = y(x) is determined implicitly by the constrain t equation above. We traced the 
constrain t curve (possible positions of the ring) on the blackboard. This curve is an ellipse with foci 
at (0, 0) and (a,b), but knowing that the curve is an ellipse does not help us &#64257;nd the lowest point. 
Experimen ts with the hanging ring show that the lowest point is somewhere in the middle. Since 
the ends of the constrain t curve are higher than the middle, the lowest point is a critical point 
(a point where y&#65533;(x) = 0). In class we also gave a physical demonstration of this by drawing the 
horizon tal tangen t at the lowest point. 
To &#64257;nd the critical point, di&#64256;eren tiate the constrain t equation implicitly with respect to x, 
&#65533; x + yy&#65533; 
+ &#65533; x &#8722; a +(y &#8722; b)y&#65533; 
=0 
x2 + y2 (x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2 
Since y&#65533; = 0 a the critical point, the equation can be rewritten as 
&#65533; x = &#65533; a &#8722; x 
x2 + y2 (x &#8722; a)2 +(y &#8722; b)2

Lecture 14: Mean Value Theorem and Inequalities
Mean-V alue Theorem
The Mean-V alue Theorem (MVT) is the underpinnin g of calculus. It says: 
If f is di&#64256;eren tiable on a&lt;x&lt;b, and continuous on a &#8804; x &#8804; b, then 
f(b) &#8722; f(a) = f&#65533;(c) (for some c, a&lt;c&lt;b)b &#8722; a 
f(b) &#8722; f(a)Here, is the slope of a secan t line, while f&#65533;(c) is the slope of a tangen t line. b &#8722; a 
secant line
slope 
f&#8217;(c)
ab
c
Figure 1: Illustration of the Mean Value Theorem. 
Geometric Proof: Take (dotted) lines parallel to the secan t line, as in Fig. 1 and shift them up 
from below the graph until one of them &#64257;rst touches the graph. Alternatively, one may have to start 
with a dotted line above the graph and move it down until it touches. 
If the function isn&#8217;t di&#64256;eren tiable, this approac h goes wrong. For instance, it breaks down for 
the function f(x)= |x|. The dotted line always touches the graph &#64257;rst at x = 0, no matter what its 
slope is, and f&#65533;(0) is unde&#64257;ned (see Fig. 2).

Inequalities 
The fundamen tal property f&#65533; &gt; 0= f is increasing can be used to deduce many other inequali&#173; &#8658;
ties. 
xExample. e
x1. e&gt; 0 
x2. e&gt; 1 for x&gt; 0 
x3. e&gt; 1+ x 
xProofs. We will take property 1 (e&gt; 0) for granted. Proofs of the other two properties follow: 
Proof of 2: De&#64257;ne f1(x)= ex &#8722;1. Then, f1(0) = e0 &#8722;1 = 0, and f&#65533;(x)= ex &gt; 0. (This last assertion 1
is from step 1). Hence, f1(x) is increasing, so f(x) &gt;f(0) for x&gt; 0. That is: 
e x &gt; 1 for x&gt; 0 
. 
xProof of 3: Let f2(x)= e&#8722; (1 + x). 
f&#65533;(x)= e x &#8722; 1= f1(x) &gt; 0 (if x&gt; 0).2
Hence, f2(x) &gt; 0 for x&gt; 0. In other words, 
e x &gt; 1+ x 
2 2x xSimilarly , e x &gt; 1+ x + 2 (proved using f3(x)= e x &#8722; (1 + x + 2 )). One can keep on going: 
2 3x xe x &gt; 1+ x + + for x&gt; 0. Eventually , it turns out that 2 3! 
2 3x xe x =1+ x + + + (an in&#64257;nite sum) 2 3! &#183;&#183;&#183; 
We will be discuss ing this when we get to Taylor series near the end of the course.

The tangen t line in the linear appro ximation has a de&#64257;n ite slope f&#65533;(a). by contrast formula is an 
exact formula. It conceals its lack of speci&#64257;cit y in the slope f&#65533;(c), which could be the slope of f at 
any point between a and x. 
(a,f(a))(x,f(x))
y=f(a) + f&#8217;(a)(x-a)error
Figure 3: MVT vs. Linear Appro ximation. 
Uses of the Mean Value Theorem. 
Key conclusions: (The conclusions from the MVT are theoretical) 
1. If f&#65533;(x) &gt; 0, then f is increasing. 
2. If f&#65533;(x) &lt; 0, then f is decreas ing. 
3. If f&#65533;(x) = 0 all x, then f is constan t. 
De&#64257;nition of increasing/decreasing: 
Increasing means a&lt;b f(a) &lt;f(b). Decreasing means a&lt;b = f(a) &lt;f(b). &#8658; &#8658; 
Proofs: 
Proof of 1: 
a&lt;b 
f(b) = f(a)+ f&#65533;(c)(b &#8722; a) 
Because f&#65533;(c) and (b &#8722; a) are both positiv e, 
f(b)= f(a)+ f&#65533;(c)(b &#8722; a) &gt;f(a) 
(The proof of 2 is omitted because it is similar to the proof of 1) 
Proof of 3: 
f(b)= f(a)+ f&#65533;(c)(b &#8722; a)= f(a) + 0(b &#8722; a)= f(a) 
Conclusions 1,2, and 3 seem obvious, but let me persuade you that they are not. Thin k back to the 
de&#64257;nition of the deriv ative. It involves in&#64257;nitesimals. It&#8217;s not a sure thing that these in&#64257;nitesimals 
have anything to do with the non-in&#64257;nitesimal behavior of the function.

Figure 2: Graph of y = |x|, with secan t line. (MVT goes wrong.) 
Interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem 
You travel from Boston to Chicago (whic h we&#8217;ll assume is a 1,000 mile trip) in exactly 3 hours. At 
1000some time in between the two cities, you must have been going at exactly mph.3
f(t) = position, measured as the distance from Boston.
f(3) = 1000, f(0) = 0,a =0, and b=3. 
1000 = f(b) &#8722; f(a)= f&#65533;(c)3 3 
where f&#65533;(c) is your speed at some time, c. 
Versions of the Mean Value Theorem 
There is a second way of writing the MVT: 
f(b) &#8722; f(a) = f&#65533;(c)(b &#8722; a) 
f(b) = f(a)+ f&#65533;(c)(b &#8722; a) (for some c,a &lt; c &lt; b) 
There is also a third way of writing the MVT: change the name of b to x. 
f(x)= f(a)+ f&#65533;(c)(x &#8722; a) for some c,a &lt; c &lt; x 
The theorem does not say what c is. It depends on f, a, and x. 
This version of the MVT should be compared with linear appro ximation (see Fig. 3).

(Two correct spellings: &#8220;L&#8217;H&#244;pital&#8221; and &#8220;L&#8217;Hospital&#8221;) 
Sometimes, we run into indeterminate forms. These are things like

Forinstance, howdoyoudealwiththefollowing?

Example 0. Onewayofdealingwiththisistousealgebratosimplify things:

&#65533; Lecture 20 18.01 Fall 2006 
If, for example, F (x) = sin x + 21. Then F &#65533;(x) = cos x and 
&#65533; b 
sin xdx = F (b) &#8722; F (a) = (sin b + 21) &#8722; (sin a + 21) = sin b &#8722; sin a 
a 
Every function of the form F (x)= G(x)+ c works in FTC 1. 
Examples of &#8220;new&#8221; functions 
The error function, which is often used in statistics and probabilit y, is de&#64257;ned as 
2 2 x 
erf(x)= e&#8722;tdt&#8730;&#960; 0 
and lim erf(x) = 1 (See Figure 2) 
x&#8594;&#8734; 
Figure 2: Graph of the error function. 
Another &#8220;new&#8221; function of this type, called the logarithmic integral, is de&#64257;ned as 
x dtLi(x) = ln t2 
This function gives the appro ximate number of prime numbers less than x. A common encryption 
technique involves encoding sensitiv e information like your bank accoun t number so that it can be 
sent over an insecure comm unication channel. The message can only be decoded using a secret 
prime number. To know how safe the secret is, a cryptographer needs to know roughl y how many 
200-digit primes there are. You can &#64257;nd out by estimating the following integral: 
&#65533; 10201 dt 
10200 ln t 
We know that 
ln10200 = 200 ln(10) &#8776; 200(2.3) = 460 and ln10201 = 201 ln(10) &#8776; 462

&#65533; Lecture 20 18.01 Fall 2006 
We will appro ximate to one signi&#64257;can t &#64257;gure: ln t &#8776; 500 for 200 &#8804; t &#8804; 10201 . 
With all of that in mind, the number of 200-digit primes is roughly 1 
&#65533; 10201 &#65533; 10201 10200dt dt 1 &#65533; &#65533; 9 &#183; 
10200 ln t &#8776; 
10200 500=500 10201 &#8722; 10200&#8776; 500 &#8776; 10198 
There are LOTS of 200-digit primes . The odds of some hacker &#64257;nding the 200-digit prime required 
to break into your bank accoun t number are very very slim. 
Another set of &#8220;new&#8221; functions are the Fresnel functions, which arise in optics: 
x 
C(x) = cos(t2)dt 
&#65533;0 
x 
S(x) = sin(t2)dt 
0 
Bessel functions often arise in problems with circular symmetry: 
&#65533; &#960;1 J0(x) = cos(x sin &#952;)d&#952;2&#960; 0 
On the homew ork, you are asked to &#64257;nd C&#65533;(x). That&#8217;s easy! 
C&#65533;(x) = cos(x 2) 
x dtWe will use FTC 2 to discuss the function L(x) = from &#64257;rst princip les next lecture. t1

&#65533; b 
cdx = c(b &#8722; a)

Think of this as &#64257;nding the area of a rectangle with base (b &#8722; a) and heigh t c. In the computation above, a = 
110200,b = 10201,c = 500

x+&#8710;xx aF(x)&#8710;Fy
Figure 1: Geometric Proof of FTC 2. 
Therefore, 
F &#65533;(x)= f(x) 
Another way to prove FTC 2 is as follows: 
&#916;F 1 x+&#916;x x 
&#916;x =&#916;xf(t)dt &#8722; f(t)dt 
a a 
1 &#65533; x+&#916;x 
=&#916;xf(t)dt (whic h is the &#8220;average value&#8221; of f on the interval x &#8804; t &#8804; x +&#916;x.) 
x 
As the length &#916;x of the interval tends to 0, this average tends to f(x). 
Proof of FTC 1 (using FTC 2) 
x 
Start with F &#65533; = f (we assume that f is continuous). Next, de&#64257;ne G(x)= f(t)dt. By FTC2, 
a 
G&#65533;(x)= f(x). Therefore, (F &#8722; G)&#65533; = F &#65533; &#8722; G&#65533; = f &#8722; f = 0. Thus, F &#8722; G = constan t. (Recall we 
used the Mean Value Theorem to show this). 
Hence, F (x)= G(x)+ c. Finally since G(a) = 0, 
&#65533; b 
f(t)dt = G(b) = G(b) &#8722; G(a) =[F (b) &#8722; c] &#8722; [F (a) &#8722; c]= F (b) &#8722; F (a) 
a 
which is FTC 1. 
Remark. In the preceding proof G was a de&#64257;nite integral and F could be any antideriv ative. Let 
us illustrate with the example f(x) = sin x. Taking a = 0 in the proof of FTC 1, 
&#65533; x &#65533;x 
G(x) = cos tdt = sin t&#65533;&#65533; = sin x and G(0) = 0.

&#65533;Lecture 20 18.01 Fall 2006 
Lecture 20: Second Fundamen tal Theorem 
Recall: First Fundamen tal Theorem of Calculus (FTC 1) 
If f is continuous and F &#65533; = f, then &#65533; b 
f(x)dx = F (b) &#8722; F (a) 
a 
We can also write that as &#65533; b x=b 
f(x)dx = f(x)dx 
x=aa 
Do all continuous functions have antideriv atives? Yes. However... 
What about a function like this?
2 e&#8722;x dx =?? 
Yes, this antiderivative exists. No, it&#8217;s not a function we&#8217;ve met before: it&#8217;s a new function. 
The new function is de&#64257;ned as an integral: 
x 2 F (x)= e&#8722;tdt 
0 
2It will have the property that F &#65533;(x)= e&#8722;x . 
sin x1/2Other new function s include antideriv atives of e&#8722;x 2 ,x e&#8722;x 2 ,, sin(x 2), cos(x 2),... x 
Second Fundamen tal Theorem of Calculus (FTC 2) 
x 
If F (x)= f(t)dt and f is continuous, then 
a 
F &#65533;(x)= f(x) 
Geometric Proof of FTC 2: Use the area interpretation: F (x) equals the area under the curve 
between a and x. 
&#916;F = F (x +&#916;x) &#8722; F (x)
&#916;F &#8776; (base)(heigh t) &#8776; (&#916;x)f(x) (See Figure 1.)
&#916;F
&#916;x &#8776; f(x)
&#916;F
Hence lim = f(x)
&#916;x0 &#916;x&#8594;
But, by the de&#64257;nition of the deriv ative: 
&#916;Flim = F &#65533;(x)

Example 10 (from PS8). x n e&#8722;xdx 
0 This converges. To carry out a convenient comparison requires some experience with growth rates 
offunctions. 
x n &lt;&lt; ex not enough. Instead use x n/ex/2 0 (true by L&#8217;Hop). It follows that &#8594; 
x n &lt;&lt; ex/2 = x n e&#8722;x &lt;&lt; ex/2 e&#8722;x = e&#8722;x/2 &#8658;

Determining DivergenceandConvergence 
Todecidewhether an integral converges ordiverges,don&#8217;t needto evaluate. Instead onecan compare 
ittoasimplerintegralthatcanbeevaluated. 
&#8734; dxThe Gener al Story for powers: xp1 
FromExamples 4,5and6weknowthatthisdiverges(isin&#64257;nite) for 0 &lt;p &#8804; 1 andconverges(is 
&#64257;nite)for p&gt; 1. 
The comparison of integrals says that a larger function has a larger integral. If we restrict 
ourselves to nonnegativ e functions, then even when the region is unbounded, as in the case of an 
improperintegral,theareaunderthegraphofthelargerfunction ismorethantheareaunderthe 
graph of the smaller one. Consider 0 &#8804; f(x) &#8804; g(x) (as in Figure 3) 
g(x) f(x)
x  = ay
x
Figure3: The area under f(x) is less than the area under g(x) for a &#8804; x&lt; &#8734;. 
&#8734; &#8734;
If g(x) dx converges,thensodoes f(x) dx. (In other words, if the area under g is&#64257;nite, 
a a 
thentheareaunder f,beingsmaller,mustalsobe&#64257;nite.) 
&#8734; &#8734;
If f(x) dx diverges,thensodoes g(x) dx. (In other words, if the area under f isin&#64257;nite, 
a a 
thentheareaunder g,beinglarger,mustalsobein&#64257;nite.) 
The way comparison is used is by replacing functions by simpler ones whose integrals we can 
calculate. You will have to decide whether you want to trap the function from above or below. This 
willdependonwhether youaredemonstrating thattheintegralis&#64257;niteorin&#64257;nite.

Application: Replace x by t =timeinsecondsinExample 1.

Eventually (over time 0 &#8804; t&lt; &#8734;) every atom decays. So the total number of atoms N is

Hence 
R = Nk = N(ln2)/H 
Let us illustrate with Polonium 210, which has been in the news lately. The half life is 138 days 
or 
H = (138days)(24hr/da y)(602sec/hr) = (138)( 24)(60)2seconds 
Using this value of H, we &#64257;nd that one gram of Polonium 210 emits (1 gram)(6 &#215; 1023/210 
atoms/gram)(l n2)/H =1.661014 decays/sec &#8776; 4500 curies

x&#8594;x0 &#916;x x&#8594;x0 &#916;x 
is never an easy limit, because the denominator &#916;x = 0 is not allowed. (The limit xx0 is 
computed under the implicit assumption that x =&#65533;x0.) &#8594;

We end this lecture with a theorem that will help us to compute more deriv atives next time. 
Theorem: Di&#64256;eren tiable Implies Continuous. 
If f is di&#64256;eren tiable at x0, then f is continuous at x0. 
f(x) &#8722; f(x0)Proof: 
xlim 
x0 (f(x) &#8722; f(x0)) = 
xlim 
x0 x &#8722; x0 (x &#8722; x0)= f&#65533;(x0) &#183; 0=0. 
&#8594; &#8594;
Remem ber: you can never divide by zero! The &#64257;rst step was to multiply by x &#8722; x0 . It looks as 
0 x &#8722; x0 
if this is illegal because when x = x0, we are multiplying by . But when computing the limit as 0 x &#8594; x0 we always assume x &#65533;= x0. In other words x &#8722; x0 &#65533;= 0. So the proof is valid.

Lecture 24: Numerical Integration 
Numerical Integration 
We use numerical integration to &#64257;nd the de&#64257;nite integrals of expressions that look like: 
&#65533; b 
(a big mess) 
a 
We also resort to numerical integration when an integral has no elemen tary antideriv ative. For 
instance, there is no formula for 
&#65533; x &#65533; 3 
cos(t2)dt or e&#8722;x 2 dx 
0 0 
Numerical integration yields numbers rather than analytical express ions. 
We&#8217;ll talk about three techniques for numerical integration: Riemann sums, the trapezoidal rule, 
and Simpson&#8217;s rule. 
1. Riemann Sum

&#65533; &#65533; Lecture 24 18.01 Fall 2006 
Note: The trapezoidal rule gives a more symmetric treatmen t of the two ends (a and b) than a 
Riemann sum does &#8212; the average of left and right Riemann sums. 
3. Simpson&#8217;s Rule 
This approac h often yields much more accurate results than the trapezoidal rule does. Here, we 
matc h quadrati cs (i.e. parab olas), instead of straigh t or slanted lines, to the graph. This approac h 
requires an even number of intervals.

Next, &#64257;nd the zeros of this function: 
y =0 ln x =0 &#8660; 
So y = 0 when x = 1. 
What happ ens as x &#8594;&#8734;? This time, consider x =2+n . 
ln2n n ln2 n(0.7) y = = 2n 2n &#8776; 2n 
So, y &#8594; 0 as n &#8594;&#8734;. Putting all of this together gets us the graph in Fig. 7.

y&#65533; =1 &#8722; ln x&gt; 0 for 0 &lt;x&lt;e x2 
Sure enough, the function is increasing between 0 and the critical point.

The points where f&#65533;&#65533; = 0 are called in&#64258;ection points. Usually , at these points the graph changes

Lecture 10: Curv e Sketching 
Goal: To draw the graph of f using the behavior of f&#65533; and f&#65533;&#65533;. We want the graph to be 
qualitativ ely correct, but not necess arily to scale. 
Typical Picture: Here, y0 is the minim um value, and x0 is the point where that minim um occurs. 
x0= critical pointy0
Figure 1: The critical point of a function 
Notice that for x&lt;x0, f&#65533;(x) &lt; 0. In other words, f is decreas ing to the left of the critical point. 
For x&gt;x0, f&#65533;(x) &gt; 0: f is increasing to the right of the critical point. 
Another typical picture: Here, y0 is the critical (maxim um) value, and x0 is the critical point. f 
is decreasing on the right side of the critical point, and increasing to the left of x0. 
x0= critical pointy0

Rubric for curve-sketching 
1. (Precalc skill) Plot the discon tinuities of f &#8212; especially the in&#64257;nite ones! 
2. Find the critical points.	These are the points at which f&#65533;(x) = 0 (usually where the slope 
changes from positiv e to negativ e, or vice versa.) 
3. (a) Plot the critical points (and critical values), but only if it&#8217;s relativ ely easy to do so. 
(b) Decide the sign of f&#65533;(x) in between the critical points (if it&#8217;s not already obvious). 
4. (Precalc skill) Find and plot the zeros of f. These are the values of x for which f(x) = 0. 
Only do this if it&#8217;s relativ ely easy. 
5. (Precalc skill) Determine the behavior at the endp oints (or at &#177;&#8734;). 
Example 1. y =3x &#8722; x3 
1. No discon tinuities. 
2.	y&#65533; =3 &#8722; 3x2 = 3(1 &#8722; x2) so, y&#65533; =0 at x = &#177;1. 
3. (a) At x = 1, y =3 &#8722; 1 = 2. 
(b) At x = &#8722;1, y = &#8722;3+1= &#8722;2. Mark these two points on the graph. 
34. Find the zeros: y =3x &#8722; x= x(3 &#8722; x2) = 0 so the zeros lie at x =0, &#177;&#8730;
3. 
5. Beha vior of the function as x &#8594; &#177;&#8734;.
As x &#8594;&#8734;, the x3 term of y dominates, so y &#8594; &#8722;&#8734;. Likewise, as x &#8594; &#8722;&#8734;, y &#8594;&#8734;.
Putting all of this information together gives us the graph as illustrated in Fig. 3)

3 Figure 3: Sketch of the function y =3x &#8722; x. Note the labeled zeros and critical points 
Let us do step 3b (the sign of f&#65533;) to doub le-check for consistency . 
y&#65533; =3 &#8722; 3x 2 = 3(1 &#8722; x 2) 
y&#65533; &gt; 0 when |x| &lt; 1; y&#65533; &lt; 0 when |x| &gt; 1. Sure enough, y is increasing between x = &#8722;1 and x = 1, 
and is decreasing everywhere else.

2nd Deriv ative Information 
When f&#65533;&#65533; &gt; 0, f&#65533; is increasing. When f&#65533;&#65533; &lt; 0, f&#65533; is decreasing. (See Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) 
slope &lt; 0
slope = 0slope &gt; 0
Figure 8: f is convex (conca ve-up). The slope increases from negativ e to positiv e as x increases. 
Figure 9: f is conca ve-down. The slope decreases from positive to negativ e as x increases. 
Therefore, the sign of the second deriv ative tells us about conca vity/con vexity of the graph. Thus 
the second deriv ative is good for two purp oses. 
1. Deciding whether a critical point is a maxim um or a minim um. This is known as the second deriv ative 
test. 
f&#65533;(x0) f&#65533;&#65533;(x0) Critical point is a: 
0 negativ e maxim um 
0 positiv e minim um

&#65533; &#65533;Example 3. y = x3 &#8722; 3x2 +3x. 
y&#65533; =3x 2 &#8722; 6x +3 = 3(x 2 &#8722; 2x +1) = 3(x &#8722; 1)2 
There is a critical point at x = 1. y&#65533; &gt; 0 on both sides of x = 1, so y is increasing everywhere. In 
this case, the sign of y&#65533; doesn&#8217;t change at the critical point, but the graph does level out (see Fig. 6.

ln xExample 4. y = (Note: this function is only de&#64257;ned for x&gt; 0) x

y =2&#8722;n =(&#8722;n ln2)2n &#8594; &#8722;&#8734; asn &#8594;&#8734; 
In other words, y decreases to &#8722;&#8734; as x approac hes zero. 
Next, we want to &#64257;nd the critical points. 
y&#65533; = ln x &#65533;

x x2 x2 
y&#65533; =0 = &#8658; 1 &#8722; ln x =0 = &#8658; ln x =1 = &#8658; x = e 
In other words, the critical point is x = e (from previous page). The critical value is 
ln e 1 y(x) |x=e = e = e

Figure 1: A graphical "proof" of the product rule 
An intuitive justification: 
We want to find the difference in area between the large rectangle and the smaller, inner rectangle. 
The inner (orange) rectangle has area uv. Define Au, the change in u,by 
Au = u(x+ Ax) -U(X) 
We also abbreviate u = u(x),so that u(x+ Ax) + = u + Au, and, similarly, v(x+ Ax) = v + Av. 
Therefore the area of the largest rectangle is (uAu) (v + Av). 
If you let v increase and keep u constant, you add the area shaded in red. If you let u increase 
and keep v constant, you add the area shaded in yellow. The sum of areas of the red and yellow 
rectangles is: 
[u(v+ Av) -uv]+ [v(u+ Au) -uv]= uAv + vAu 
If Au and Av are small, then (Au)(Av) FZ 0, that is, the area of the white rectangle is very 
small. Therefore the difference in area between the laxgest rectangle and the orange rectangle is 
approximately the same as the sum of areas of the red and yellow rectangles. Thus we have: 
[(u+ Au) (v + Av) -uv]w uAv + vAu 
(Divide by Ax and let Ax + 0 to finish the argument.) </text>

Derivatives of Products, Quotients, Sine, and

Derivative Formulas 
There are two kinds of derivative formulas: 
d1. Specific Examples: -x" or -dx 
2. General Examples: (u +v)' =u1+v1 and (cu) = cul (where c is a constant) 
A notational convention we will use today is: 
Proof of (u+v) = u' +v'. (General) 
$@rt by using the definition af &amp;hederivative. 
(U +v)'(x) = lirn (U+U)(X+ax) -(U+v)(x) 
Ax-0 ax 
U(X+ax) +V(X+AX)-U(X)-V(X) = lirn 
Ax-0 ax 
= lim {u(x +Ax) -u(x) + v (x +Ax) -v(x)

Follow the same procedure to prove that (cu)' = cu'.

cos Ax -1 sin Ax = AX-o Ax lim COSX(~) lim sins( )+ asto 
cos Ax -1 sin Ax Since +0 and that --+ 1,the equation above simplifies to Ax Ax 
d
-sinx = cosxdx 
A similar calculation gives 
d -cosx = -dx 
Product formula (General) 
(uv)' = ulv + uvl 
Proof: 
(uv) (X + AX)-(UV)(x) u(x + Ax)v(x + Ax) -u(x)v(x)(uv)' = lim = lim 
hxt~ Ax Axto AX 
Now obviously, 
so adding that to the numerator won't change anything. 
u(x + Ax)v(x) -u(x)v(x) + U(X + AX)V(X+ Ax) -u(x + Ax)v(x)(uv)' = lirn 
Ax-0 AX 
We can re-arrange that expression to get 
(uv)' = lim ) V(X)+ U(X + AX)Ax-0 
Remember, the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. 
u(x + Ax) -u(x) 
Ax-0 Ax 
 I &gt; 
(uv)' =ul(x)v(x)+ u(x)vl(x) 
Note: we also used the fact that 
lirn u(x + Ax) = u(x) (true because u is continuous) 
Ax-0 
This proof of the product rule assumes that u and v have derivatives, which implies both functions 
are continuous. </text>

Lecture 16: Di&#64256;eren tial Equations and Separation
of Variables 
Ordinary Di&#64256;eren tial Equations (ODEs) 
Example 1. dy = f(x)dx 
Solution: y = f(x)dx. We consider these types of equations as solved. 
Example 2. d + xy =0 or dy + xy =0 dx dx 
d( + x is known in quan tum mechanics as the annihilation operator. )dx 
Besides integration, we have only one metho d of solving this so far, namely , substitution. Solving 
for dy gives: dx dy = &#8722;xydx 
The key step is to separate variables. 
dy = &#8722;xdx y 
Note that all y-dependence is on the left and all x-dependence is on the right. 
Next, take the antideriv ative of both sides: 
dy 
y = &#8722; xdx 
2xln |y| = &#8722; 2+ c (only need one constan t c) 
|y| = e c e&#8722;x 2/2 (exponentiate) 
2y = ae&#8722;x/2 (a = &#177;e c) 
cDespite the fact that e=&#65533;0,a = 0 is possible along with all a =&#65533;0, dependin g on the initial 
conditions. For instance, if y(0) = 1, then y = e&#8722;x 2/2 . If y(0) = a, then y = ae&#8722;x 2/2 (See Fig. 1).

In general: 
dy = f(x)g(y)dx 
dy = f(x)dx which we can write as g(y) 
1 h(y)dy = f(x)dx where h(y)= . g(y) 
Now, we get an implicit formula for y: 
H(y)= F (x)+ c (H(y)= h(y)dy; F (x)= f(x)dx) 
where H&#65533; = h, F &#65533; = f, and 
y = H&#8722;1(F (x)+ c)

Example 4. Find the curves that are perpendicular to the parab olas in Example 3. 
We know that their slopes, 
dy &#8722;1 &#8722;x = = dx slope of parab ola 2y 
Separate variables: 
ydy = &#8722;xdx2 
Take the antideriv ative: 2 2 2 2y x x y
2= &#8722; 4+ c = &#8658; 4+2= c 
which is an equation for a family of ellipses. For these ellipses, the ratio of the x-semi-ma jor axis to 
the y-semi-m inor axis is &#8730;
2 (see Fig. 3). 
Figure 3: The ellipses are perpendicular to the parab olas. 
Separation of variables leads to implicit formulas for y, but in this case you can solve for y.

Find a graph such that the slope of the tangen t line is twice the slope of the ray from (0, 0) to (x,y) 
seen in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: The slope of the tangen t line (red) is twice the slope of the ray from the origin to the point (x,y).

Thus, 
y = ax 2 
Again, a&lt; 0, a&gt; 0 and a = 0 are all acceptable. Possible solutions include, for example, 
y = x 2 (a = 1) 
y =2x 2 (a = 2) 
y = &#8722;x 2 (a = &#8722;1) 
y =0x 2 =0 (a = 0) 
y = &#8722;2y 2 (a = &#8722;2) 
y = 100x 2 (a = 100)

Figure 4: y = x2, rotated about the y-axis. 
First, recall how to &#64257;nd the volume of the solid of revolution by disks. 
&#65533; 1 &#65533; 1 &#960;y2 1 &#960; = 
0 2V = (&#960;x2) dy = &#960;y dy = 20 0 
Recall that T (y) = 100 &#8722; 30y and (T (0) = 100o; T (1) = 70o). The average temp erature per unit 
volume is computed by giving an importance or &#8220;weighting&#8221; w(y)= &#960;y to the disk at heigh t y. 
&#65533; 1 T (y)w(y) dy0 &#65533; 1 w(y) dy0 
The numerator is 
&#65533; 1 &#65533; 1 1 
(100 &#8722; 30y)ydy = &#960;(500y 2 &#8722; 10y 3) = 40&#960; T &#960;y dy = &#960; 
0 0 
Thus the average temp eratu re is: 0 
40&#960; = 80oC &#960;/2 
Compare this with the average taken with respect to height y: 
&#65533; 1 &#65533; 11 T dy = 1 (100 &#8722; 30y)dy = (100y &#8722; 15y 2) 1 
= 85oC 
00 0 
T is linear. Largest T = 100oC, smallest T = 70oC, and the average of the two is 
70 + 100 = 85 2

It follows that 
&#8734; &#8734; 2 &#8734; 2 V = A(y) dy = e&#8722;y Qdy = Qe&#8722;y dy = Q2 
&#8722;&#8734; &#8722;&#8734; &#8722;&#8734; 
Indeed, &#65533; &#65533;&#8734; 2 &#8734; 2 Q = e&#8722;x dx = e&#8722;y dy 
&#8722;&#8734; &#8722;&#8734; 
because the name of the variable does not matter. To conclude the calculation read the equation 
backwards: 
&#960; = V = Q2 = Q = &#8730;&#960;&#8658; 
We can rewrite Q = &#8730;&#960; as &#65533;
1 &#8734;
2 &#8730;&#960;e&#8722;x dx =1 
&#8722;&#8734; 
An equiv alent rescaled version of this formula (replacing x with x/&#8730;
2&#963;)is used: 
1 &#8734; 2 /2&#963;2 &#8730;
2&#960;&#963; &#8722;&#8734; e&#8722;x dx =1

2&#960;&#963; 
&#8722;&#8734; &lt;x&lt; &#8734; is known as the normal distribution, and &#963;&gt; 0 is its standard deviation.

Volume by Slices: An Importan t Example
&#8734; 2Compute Q = e&#8722;x dx 
&#8722;&#8734; 
Figure 8: Q = Area under curve e(&#8722;x 2). 
This is one of the most importan t integrals in all of calculus. It is especially importan t in probabi lity 
and statistics. It&#8217;s an improp er integral, but don&#8217;t let those &#8734;&#8217;s scare you. In this integral, they&#8217;re 
actually easier to work with than &#64257;nite numbers would be. 
To &#64257;nd Q, we will &#64257;rst &#64257;nd a volume of revolution, namely , 
2 V = volume under e&#8722;r (r = x2 + y2) 
We &#64257;nd this volume by the metho d of shells, which leads to the same integral as in the last problem. 
2The shell or cylinder under e&#8722;r at radius r has circumference 2&#960;r, thickness dr; (see Figure 9). 
2Therefore dV = e&#8722;r 2&#960;rdr. In the range 0 &#8804; r &#8804; R, 
&#65533; R 2 2 R 
= &#8722;&#960;e&#8722;R2 + &#960; e&#8722;r 2&#960;r dr = &#8722;&#960;e&#8722;r

The answ er 85o is consisten t with the ordinary average. The weighted average (integration with 
respect to &#960;y dy) is lower (80o) because there is more water at cooler temp eratures in the upper 
parts of the cauldron. 
Dart board, revisited 
Last time, we said that the accuracy of your aim at a dart board follows a &#8220;normal distribution&#8221;: 
2 ce&#8722;r 
Now, let&#8217;s pretend someone &#8211; say, your little brother &#8211; foolishly decides to stand close to the dart 
board. What is the chance that he&#8217;ll get hit by a stray dart?

Figure 5: Shaded section is 2ri &lt;r&lt; 3r1 between 3 and 5 o&#8217;clock. 
To make our calculations easier, let&#8217;s appro ximate your brother as a sector (the shaded region 
in Fig. 5). Your brother doesn&#8217;t quite stand in front of the dart board. Let us say he stands at a 
distance r from the center where 2r1 &lt;r&lt; 3r1 and r1 is the radius of the dart board. Note that 
your brother doesn&#8217;t surround the dart board. Let us say he covers the region between 3 o&#8217;clock

Di&#64256;eren tials 
New notation: 
dy = f&#65533;(x)dx (y = f(x)) 
Both dy and f&#65533;(x)dx are called di&#64256;er entials . You can think of 
dy = f&#65533;(x)dx 
as a quotien t of di&#64256;erentials. One way this is used is for linear appro ximations. 
&#916;y dy

A good base point is a = 64, because 641/3 = 4. 
Let x = 65.

Example 5. sin x cos xdx = sin2 x + c2
Another, equally acceptable answ er is 
sin x cos xdx = &#8722; 1
cos2 x + c

This seem s like a contradiction, so let&#8217;s check our answ ers: 
d sin2 x = (2 sin x)(cos x)dx 
and d 2
cosx = (2 cos x)(&#8722; sin x)dx 
So both of these are correct. Here&#8217;s how we resolv e this apparen t parado x: the di&#64256;erence between 
the two answ ers is a constant. 
1 sin2 x &#8722; (&#8722; 1 cos2 x) = 1(sin2 x + cos2 x)= 1

Anti-deriv atives 
F (x)= f(x)dx means that F is the antideriv ative of f. 
Other ways of saying this are: 
F &#65533;(x)= f(x) or, dF = f(x)dx 
Examples: 
1. sin xdx = &#8722; cos x + c where c is any constan t. 
n+1x2. x ndx = n +1 + c for n &#65533;= &#8722;1. 
dx3. x = ln |x| + c (This takes care of the exceptional case n = &#8722;1 in 2.) 
4. sec2 xdx = tan x + c 
dx	 15. &#8730;
1 &#8722; x2 = sin&#8722;1 x + c (where sin&#8722;1 x denotes &#8220;inverse sin&#8221; or arcsin, and not sin x ) 
6.	dx = tan&#8722;1(x)+ c1+ x2 
Proof of Prop erty 2: The absolute value |x| gives the correct answ er for both positiv e and negativ e 
x. We will double check this now for the case x&lt; 0: 
ln |x|

&#65533; &#65533; 
&#65533; Uniqueness of the antideriv ative up to an additiv e constan t. 
If F &#65533;(x)= f(x), and G&#65533;(x)= f(x), then G(x)= F (x)+ c for some constan t factor c. 
Proof:
(G &#8722; F )&#65533; = f &#8722; f =0
Recall that we proved as a corollary of the Mean Value Theorem that if a function has a deriv ative 
zero then it is constan t. Hence G(x) &#8722; F (x)= c (for some constan t c). That is, G(x)= F (x)+ c. 
Metho d of substitution. 
Example 1. x 3(x 4 + 2)5dx 
Substitution: 
1 u = x 4 +2, du =4x 3dx, (x 4 + 2)5 = u 5 ,x 3dx = du4 
Hence, &#65533; &#65533;1 u6 u6 1 x 3(x 4 + 2)5dx = u 5du = = + c = (x 4 + 2)6 + c4 4(6) 24 24 
xExample 2. dx&#8730;
1+ x2 
Another way to &#64257;nd an anti-deriv ative is &#8220;advanced guessing.&#8221; First write 
x &#8730;
1+ x2 dx = x(1 + x 2)&#8722;1/2dx 
Guess: (1 + x 2)1/2 . Chec k this. 
d 1(1 + x 2)1/2 = (1+ x 2)&#8722;1/2(2x) = x(1 + x 2)&#8722;1/2 
dx 2 
Therefore, &#65533; 
x(1 + x 2)&#8722;1/2dx = (1+ x 2)1/2 + c 
Example 3. e 6xdx 
Guess: e 6x . Chec k this: de 6x =6e 6x 
dx 
Therefore, &#65533; 1 e 6xdx = e 6x + c6

Lecture 4  
Chain  
Rule, and Higher Derivatives 
Chain Rule 
We&#8217;ve got general procedures for di&#64256;eren tiating expressions with addition, subtraction, and multi&#173; 
plication. What about comp osition?
Example 1. y = f(x) = sin x,x = g(t)= t2 .
So, y = f(g(t)) = sin(t2). To &#64257;nd dy , write
dt 
t = t0 +&#916;t t0 = t0 
x = x0 +&#916;x x0 = g(t0) 
y = y0 +&#916;y y0 = f(x0) 
&#916;y =&#916;y &#916;x 
&#916;t &#916;x &#183; &#916;t 
As &#916;t 0, &#916;x 0 too, because of continuity. So we get: &#8594;&#8594; 
dy dydx = The Chain Rule! dt dx dt &#8592; 
In the example, dx 
dt = 2t and dy 
dx = cos x. 
So, d 
dt &#65533; 
sin(t2) &#65533; 
= ( dy 
dx )( dx 
dt ) 
= 
= (cos x)(2t) 
(2t) &#65533; 
cos(t2) &#65533; 
Another notation for the chain rule 
&#65533; &#65533; d 
dt f(g(t)) = f&#65533;(g(t))g&#65533;(t) or d 
dx f(g(x)) = f&#65533;(g(x))g&#65533;(x) 
Example 1. (continued) Comp osition of functions f(x) = sin x and g(x)= x2 
(fg)(x) = f(g(x)) = sin(x 2) &#9702; 
(gf)(x) = g(f(x)) = sin2(x) &#9702; 
Note: f &#9702; g &#65533;= g &#9702; f. Not Commutative!

Higher Deriv atives
Higher derivatives are deriv atives of deriv atives. For instance, if g = f&#65533;, then h = g&#65533; is the second 
deriv ative of f. We write h =(f&#65533;)&#65533; = f&#65533;&#65533;</text>

n|| n|&#8594; 
as n &#8594;&#8734; (&#8220;geometrically&#8221;). On the other hand, if 
1|x| &gt;R, then 
1|anx| does not tend to 0. For 
example, inthecaseofthegeometric series,if |a| =2 ,then |a n| =2n . Since the higher-order terms 
getincreasingly smallif |a| &lt; 1, the &#8220;tail&#8221; of the series is negligible. 
nExample 1. If a = &#8722;1, |a| =1 doesnottendto 0.

Taylor&#8217;sFormula tellsuswhatthecoe&#64259;cientsare:

Remember, n!= n(n &#8722; 1)(n &#8722; 2) (2)(1) and 0! = 1. Coe&#64259;cients an aregivenby: &#183;&#183;&#183;

f&#65533;(x)= e x 
f&#65533;&#65533;(x)= e x

How high would this stack of blocks be if we extended it across the two lab tables here at the 
front of the lecture hall? The blocks are 30 cmby 3 cm (see Figure 7). One lab table is 6.5 blocks, 
or 13 units, long. Two tables are 26 units long. There will be 26 &#8722; 2 = 24 unitsofoverhanginthe 
stack.

Geometric Series 
Ageometric serieslookslike 
1+ a + a 2 + a 3 + ... = S 
There&#8217;s a trick to evaluate this: multiply both sides by a: 
a + a 2 + a 3 + ... = aS 
Subtracting, 
(1 + a + a 2 + a 3 + ) &#8722; (a + a 2 + a 3 + )= S &#8722; aS &#183;&#183;&#183; &#183;&#183;&#183; 
Inotherwords, 
11= S &#8722; aS = &#8658; 1 = (1 &#8722; a)S = &#8658; S =1 &#8722; a 
Thisonlyworkswhen |a| &lt; 1,i.e. &#8722;1 &lt;a&lt; 1. 
a =1 can&#8217;twork: 
1+1+1+ ... = &#8734; 
a = &#8722;1 can&#8217;twork,either: 
1 11 &#8722; 1+1 &#8722; 1+ ... =&#65533;1 &#8722; (&#8722;1) = 2 
Notation 
Here is some notation that&#8217;s useful for dealing with series or sums. An in&#64257;nite sum is written: 
&#8734;
ak = a0 + a1 + a2 + ... 
k=0 
The&#64257;nitesum n
Sn = ak = a0 + ... + an 
k=0 
iscalledthe &#8220;nth partial sum&#8221; of the in&#64257;nite series.

IntegralComparison 
1Consider apositive,decreasing function f(x) &gt; 0. (For example, f(x)= )xp 
&#8734; 
f(x)dx &#8734;&#65533; 
=1nf(n) &#8722; &lt;f(1) 
1 
So, either both of the terms converge, or they both diverge. This is what we mean when we say 
&#8734;
np &#8764; 
1 xp &#65533; 
=1n1 &#8734; dx 
&#8734;
Lots of fudge room: in comparison. &#65533;

&#8730;
n2 + 10
diverges,because 
1 1 1 &#8730;
n2 + 10 &#8764; (n2)1/2 = n 
Limit comparison: 
If f(x) &#8764; g(x) as x &#8594;&#8734;,then f(n) and g(n) eitherbothconvergeorbothdiverge. 
What,exactly,does f(x) &#8764; g(x) mean? It means that 
f(x)lim = c 
x&#8594;&#8734; g(x) 
where 0 &lt;c&lt; &#8734;. 
Let&#8217;s check: does the following series converge? 
&#8734;
&#8730;
n5 &#8722; 10 n=1

Wesaytheseries conver ges to s, if the limit exists and is &#64257;nite. The importance of convergence is 
illustrated here by the example of the geometric series. If a =1,S =1+1+1+ ... = &#8734;. But

Another typeofseries:

We can use integrals to decide if this type of series converges. First, turn the sum into an integral:

n=1 1 
Ifthatimproperintegralevaluatestoa&#64257;nitenumber,theseriesconverges. 
Note: This approach only tells us whether or not a series converges. It does not tell us what 
number the series converges to. That is a much harder problem. For example, it takes a lot of work 
todetermine 
&#65533; &#960;2&#8734;1 = n2 6 n=1

          <text>&#65533; Exam 3 Review 18.01 Fall 2006 
Is it possible to build a perpetual motion machine? Let&#8217;s think about a simple pendulum, and 
how much work gravity performs in pulling the pendulum from &#952;0 to the bottom of the pendulum&#8217;s 
arc. 
Notice that F varies. That&#8217;s why we have to use an integral for this problem. 
&#65533; &#952;0 &#65533; &#952;0 
W = (Force) (Distance) = (mg sin &#952;)(Ld&#952;) &#183; 
0 0 
W = &#8722;Lmg cos &#952;&#65533;&#65533;&#952;0 
= &#8722;Lmg(cos &#952;0 &#8722; 1) = mg [L(1 &#8722; cos &#952;0)] 
0 
In Figure 3, we see that the work performed by gravity moving the pendulum down a distance 
L(1 &#8722; cos &#952;) is the same as if it went straigh t down. 
&#952;
L
L(1-cos&#952;)
Figure 3: E&#64256;ect of gravity on a pendulum. 
In other words, the amoun t of work required depends only on how far down the pendulum goes. 
It doesn&#8217;t matter what path it takes to get there. So, there&#8217;s no free (energy) lunch, no perpetual 
motion machine.

3. Riemann sums; trapezoidal and Simpson&#8217;s rules. 
4. Areas, volumes. 
5. Other cumulativ e sums: average value, probabilit y, work, etc. 
There are two types of volume problems: 
1. solids of revolution 
2. other (do by slices) 
In these problems, there will be somethin g you can draw in 2D, to be able to see what&#8217;s going on in 
that one plane. 
In solid of revolution problems, the solid is formed by revolution around the x-axis or the y-axis. 
You will have to decide how to chop up the solid: into shells or disks. Put another way, you must 
decide whether to integrate with dx or dy. After making that choice, the rest of the procedure is 
systematically determined. For example, consider a shape rotated around the y-axis. 
&#8226; Shells: heigh t y2 &#8722; y1, circumference 2&#960;x, thickness dx 
&#8226; Disks (washers) : area &#960;x2 (or &#960;x2
2 &#8722; &#960;x2), thickness dy; integrate dy.1
Work 
Work = Force Distance&#183; 
We need to use an integral if the force is variable.

          <text>&#65533; &#65533; The key here is to draw the two-dimensional cross-section. We use the letters r and h to represen t 
the variable radius and heigh t of the water at any level. We can &#64257;nd the relationship between r and 
h from Fig. 3) using similar triangles.

From Fig. 3), we see that 
r 4 = h 10 
or, in other words, 
2 r = 5 h 
Plug this expression for r back into V to get

Lecture 12: Related Rates
Example 1. Police are 30 feet from the side of the road. Their radar sees your car approac hing at 
80 feet per second when your car is 50 feet away from the radar gun. The speed limit is 65 miles 
per hour (whic h translates to 95 feet per second). Are you speeding? 
First, draw a diagram of the setup (as in Fig. 1): 
RoadCarPolice
30 D=50
x
Figure 1: Illustration of example 1: triangle with the police, the car, the road, D and x labelled. 
Next, give the variables names. The importan t thing to &#64257;gure out is which variables are changing. 
dDAt D = 50, x = 40. (We know this because it&#8217;s a 3-4-5 right triangle.) In addition, = D&#65533; = dt 
&#8722;80. D&#65533; is negativ e because the car is moving in the &#8722;x direction. Don&#8217;t plug in the value for D 
yet! D is changi ng, and it depends on x. 
The Pythagorean theorem says
302 + x 2 = D2
Di&#64256;eren tiate this equation with respect to time (implicit di&#64256;eren tiation: 
d &#65533; 2 &#65533; 2DD&#65533;
302 + x = D2= 2xx&#65533; =2DD&#65533; = x&#65533; = dt &#8658; &#8658; 2x 
Now, plug in the instan taneous numerical values: 
50 feet x&#65533; = 40(&#8722;80) = &#8722;100 s 
This excee ds the speed limit of 95 feet per second; you are, in fact, speeding.

          <slideno>2</slideno>
          <text>&#65533; There is another, longer, way of solving this problem. Start with 
D = 302 + x2 = (302 + x 2)1/2 
d 1 dx D = (302 + x 2)&#8722;1/2(2x )dt 2 dt 
Plug in the values: 
1 dx &#8722;80= (302 + 402)&#8722;1/2(2)(40)2 dt 
and solve to &#64257;nd dx feet = &#8722;100dt s 
(A third strategy is to di&#64256;eren tiate x = &#8730;
D2 &#8722; 302). It is easiest to di&#64256;ere ntiate the equation in its 
simplest algebraic form 302 + x2 = D2, our &#64257;rst approac h. 
The general strategy for these types of problems is: 
1. Draw a picture. Set up variables and equations. 
2. Take deriv atives. 
3. Plug in the given values. Don&#8217;t plug the values in until after taking the deriv atives. 
Example 2. Consider a conical tank. Its radius at the top is 4 feet, and it&#8217;s 10 feet high. It&#8217;s being 
&#64257;lled with water at the rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. How fast is the water level rising when it is 
5 feet high?

Another notation intheinde&#64257;nite caseis 
udv = uv &#8722; v du 
Thisisthesamebecause 
dv = v&#65533; dx = uv&#65533; dx = udv and du = u&#65533; dx = u&#65533;v dx = vu&#65533; dx = v du &#8658; &#8658; 
Example 2. (ln x)dx

We can also use &#8220;advanced guessing&#8221; to solve this problem. We know that the derivative of 
something equals ln x: 
d (??) = ln x dx 
Let&#8217;stry 
d 1(x ln x) = ln x + x = ln x +1 dx &#183; x 
That&#8217;s almost it, but not quite. Let&#8217;s repair this guess to get: 
d (x ln x &#8722; x) = ln x +1 &#8722; 1 = ln x dx 
Reduction Formulas (Recurrence Formulas) 
Example 3. (ln x)n dx 
Let&#8217;stry: &#65533;&#65533;1 u = (ln x)n = u&#65533; = n(ln x)n&#8722;1 &#8658; x 
v&#65533; = dx; v = x

Parame tric Equations 
Example 6. 
x = a cos t 
y = a sin t 
Ask yourself: what&#8217;s constant? What&#8217;s varying? Here, t isvariableand a isconstant. 
Istherearelationship between x and y? Yes: 
x 2 + y 2 = a 2 cos2 t + a 2 sin2 t = a 2 
Extrainformation (besidesthecircle): 
At t =0, 
x = a cos0 = a and y = a sin0 = 0 
&#960;At t = ,2 &#960; &#960; x = a cos =0 and y = a sin = a2 2 
Thus,for 0 &#8804; t &#8804; &#960;/2, a quarter circle is traced counter-clockwise (Figure 7).

What is (e x)? We just de&#64257;ned M(e)=1,and (e x)= M(e)e x . So dx dx 
d (e x)= e x

Natural log (inverse function of ex) 
To understand M(a) better, we study the natural log function ln(x). This function is de&#64257;ned as 
follows: 
If y = e x , then ln(y)= x 
(or) 
If w = ln(x), then e x = w 
xNote that eis always positiv e, even if x is negativ e. 
Recall that ln(1) = 0; ln(x) &lt; 0 for 0 &lt;x&lt; 1; ln(x) &gt; 0 for x&gt; 1. Recall also that 
ln(x 1x2) = ln x1 + ln x2 
Let us use implicit di&#64256;eren tiation to &#64257;nd d ln(x). w = ln(x). We want to &#64257;nd dw . dx dx

M(a) 
(slope of ax at x=0)ax
Figure 1: Geometric de&#64257;nition of M(a) 
x2. Geometrically , M(a) is the slope of the graph y = aat x = 0. 
The trick to &#64257;guring out what M(a) is is to beg the question and de&#64257;ne e as the number such 
that M(e) = 1. Now can we be sure there is such a number e? First notice that as the base a 
xincreases, the graph agets steeper. Next, we will estimate the slope M(a) for a = 2 and a =4 
geometrically . Look at the graph of 2x in Fig. 2. The secant line from (0, 1) to (1, 2) of the graph 
y =2x has slope 1. Therefore, the slope of y =2x at x = 0 is less: M(2) &lt; 1 (see Fig. 2). 
11Next, look at the graph of 4x in Fig. 3. The secant line from (&#8722; 2 , 2) to (1, 0) on the graph of 
y =4x has slope 1. Therefore, the slope of y =4x at x = 0 is greate r than M(4) &gt; 1 (see Fig. 3). 
Somewhere in between 2 and 4 there is a base whose slope at x =0 is 1.

1Take the limit: h = k &#8594; 0 as k &#8594;&#8734;, so that 
ln(1 + h) &#8722; ln(1) d &#65533;&#65533; 
lim = ln(x)&#65533; =1 
h0 h dx x=1 &#8594;
In all, &#65533;&#65533;k1limln 1+ =1. 
k&#8594;&#8734; k 
&#65533;&#65533;k1We have just found that ak =ln[ 1+ k ] &#8594; 1 as k &#8594;&#8734;. 
&#65533;&#65533;k1If bk = 1+ k , then bk = e ak &#8594; e 1 as k &#8594;&#8734;. In other words, we have evaluated the limit we 
wanted: 
&#65533;&#65533;k1lim 1+ = e 
k&#8594;&#8734; k 
Remark 1. We never &#64257;gured out what the exact numerical value of e was. Now we can use this 
limit formula; k = 10 gives a prett y good appro ximation to the actual value of e. 
Remark 2. Logs are used in all sciences and even in &#64257;nance. Think about the stock mark et. If I 
say the mark et fell 50 points today, you&#8217;d need to know whether the mark et average before the drop 
was 300 points or 10, 000. In other words, you care about the percen t change, or the ratio of the 
change to the starting value: 
f&#65533;(t) d = ln(f(t))f(t) dt

d Finally , what about (a x)? dx
There are two metho ds we can use: 
Metho d 1: Write base e and use chain rule. 
Rewrite a as eln(a). Then, &#65533;&#65533;x 
a x = eln(a) = e x ln(a) 
That looks like it migh t be tricky to di&#64256;eren tiate. Let&#8217;s work up to it: 
d e x = e x 
dx 
and by the chain rule, 
d e 3x = 3e 3x 
dx 
Remem ber, ln(a) is just a constan t number&#8211; not a variable! Therefore, 
de(ln a)x = (ln a)e(ln a)x 
dx 
or 
d (a x) = ln(a) a x 
dx &#183; 
Recall that d (a x)= M (a) a x 
dx &#183;
So now we know the value of M(a): M(a) = ln(a).
Even if we insist on starting with another base, like 10, the natural logarithm appears:
d 10x = (ln 10)10x 
dx 
The base e may seem strange at &#64257;rst. But, it comes up everywhere. After a while, you&#8217;ll learn to 
appreciate just how natural it is. 
Metho d 2: Logarithmic Di&#64256;eren tiation. 
d dThe idea is to &#64257;nd f(x) by &#64257;ndin g ln(f(x)) instead. Some times this approac h is easier. Let dx dx 
u = f(x). &#65533;&#65533; d d ln(u) du 1 duln(u)= = dx dudx udx 
duSince u = f and = f&#65533;, we can also write dx 
f&#65533;
(ln f)&#65533; = or f&#65533; = f(ln f)&#65533; 
f

xApply this to f(x)= a. 
d d dln f(x)= x ln a = ln(f) = ln(a x)= (x ln(a)) = ln(a). &#8658; dx dx dx 
(Remem ber, ln(a) is a constan t, not a variable.) Hence, 
d f&#65533; d x x(ln f) = ln(a) = =ln(a) = f&#65533; = ln(a)f = a = (ln a)a dx &#8658; f &#8658; &#8658; dx 
dExample 1. (x x) =? dx 
With variable (&#8220;mo ving&#8221;) exponents, you should use either base e or logarithmic di&#64256;eren tiation . 
In this example, we will use the latter. 
f = x x 
ln f = x ln x 
1(ln f)&#65533; = 1 (ln x)+ x = ln(x)+1 &#183; x 
f&#65533;
(ln f)&#65533; = f 
Therefore, 
f&#65533; = f(ln f)&#65533; = x x (ln(x) + 1) 
If you wanted to solve this using the base e approac h, you would say f = ex ln x and di&#64256;erentiate 
it using the chain rule. It gets you the same answ er, but requires a little more writing. 
&#65533;&#65533;k1Example 2. Use logs to evaluate lim 1 + . 
k&#8594;&#8734; k 
Because the exponent k changes, it is better to &#64257;nd the limit of the logarithm. 
&#65533;&#65533; &#65533;k &#65533; 
1lim ln 1+ 
k&#8594;&#8734; k 
We know that &#65533;&#65533; &#65533;k &#65533; &#65533;&#65533;
1 1
ln 1+ = k ln 1+ k k 
1This expression has two comp eting parts, which balance: k &#8594;&#8734; while ln 1+ k &#8594; 0. 
&#65533;&#65533; 1 &#65533;k &#65533;&#65533; 1 &#65533; ln &#65533; 
1+ k 1 &#65533; 
ln(1 + h) 1ln 1+ = k ln1+ = 1 = (with h =)k k h kk 
Next, because ln 1 = 0 &#65533;&#65533; &#65533;k &#65533;
ln 1+ 1 =ln(1+ h) &#8722; ln(1)

The fastest way is to do this in your head or physically cover up the struck-through terms. For 
instance, toevaluate B: 
4x &#8722; 1 A&#65533; B 
(x &#8722; 1)&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;x &#8722; 1(x + 2) (x +2) = 
&#65533;&#65533;+ 
&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;
Implicitly ,wearemultiplying by (x + 2) andsetting x = &#8722;2. This gives us 
4(&#8722;2) &#8722; 1= B = B =3 &#8722;2 &#8722; 1 &#8658; 
What we&#8217;ve described so far works when Q(x) factors completely into distinct factors and the 
degreeof P islessthanthedegreeof Q. 
Ifthefactorsof Q repeat, we use a slightly di&#64256;erent approach. For example:
x2 +2 A B C
= + +(x &#8722; 1)2(x + 2) x &#8722; 1(x &#8722; 1)2 x +2 
Usethecover-upmethodonthehighestdegreetermin (x &#8722; 1). 
x2 +1 12 +2 = B +[stu&#64256;](x &#8722; 1)2 = = B = B =1 x +2 &#8658; 1+2 &#8658; 
Implicitly ,wemultiplied by (x &#8722; 1)2,thentookthelimitas x &#8594; 1. 
C can also be evaluated by the cover-up method. Set x = &#8722;2 toget 
x2 +2 2 
= C +[stu&#64256;](x +2) = (&#8722;2)2 +2 = C = C =2 
(x &#8722; 1) &#8658; (&#8722;2 &#8722; 1)2 &#8658; 3 
Thisyields 
x2 +2 A 1 2/3 = + +(x &#8722; 1)2(x + 2) x &#8722; 1(x &#8722; 1)2 x +2 
Cover-upcan&#8217;tbeusedtoevaluateA.Instead, pluginaneasyvalueofx: x =0. 
2 A 1 1 1 
(&#8722;1)2(2) = &#8722;1+1+ 3 = &#8658; 1=1+ 3 &#8722; A = &#8658; A =3 
Nowwehaveacomplete answer: 
x2 +2 1 1 2 = + +(x &#8722; 1)2(x + 2) 3(x &#8722; 1) (x &#8722; 1)2 3(x + 2) 
Not all polynomials factor completely (without resorting to using complex numbers). For exam&#173;
ple: 
1 A1 B1x + C1 = +(x2 + 1)(x &#8722; 1) x &#8722; 1 x2 +1 
We&#64257;nd A1,asusual,bythecover-upmethod. 
1 1 = A1 = A1 = 12 +1 &#8658; 2

(x &#8722; 1)(x + 2): 
(4x &#8722; 1) = A(x + 2) + B(x &#8722; 1)

You can remem ber the quotien t rule by rewriting

and applying the product rule and chain rule. 
Implicit di&#64256;eren tiation 
Let&#8217;s say you want to &#64257;nd y&#65533; from an equation like 
y 3 +3xy 2 =8 
dInstead of solving for y and then taking its deriv ative, just take of the whole thing. In this dx example, 
3y 2 y&#65533; +6xyy&#65533; +3y 2 =0 
(3y 2 +6xy)y&#65533; = &#8722;3y 2 
y&#65533; = &#8722;3y2 
3y2 +6xy 
Note that this formula for y&#65533; involves both x and y. Implicit di&#64256;eren tiation can be very useful for 
taking the deriv atives of inverse functions. 
For instance,
y = sin&#8722;1 x sin y = x
&#8658; 
Implicit di&#64256;eren tiation yields 
(cos y)y&#65533; =1 
and 1 1 y&#65533; = = cos y &#8730;

Why are these functions called &#8220;hyperbolic&#8221;? 
Let u = cosh(x ) and v = sinh(x ), then

which is the equation of a hyperbola. 
Regular trig functions are &#8220;circular&#8221; functions. If u = cos(x) and v = sin(x), then 
u 2 + v 2 =1 
which is the equation of a circle.

Lecture 21: Applications to Logarithms and
Geometry
Application of FTC 2 to Logarithms 
The integral de&#64257;nition of functions like C(x), S(x) of Fresnel makes them nearly as easy to use as 
elemen tary functions. It is possible to draw their graphs and tabulate values. You are asked to 
carry out an example or two of this on your problem set. To get used to using de&#64257;nite integrals 
and FTC2, we will discuss in detail the simplest integral that gives rise to a relativ ely new function, 
namely the logarithm. 
Recall that &#65533; n+1xx ndx = + c n +1 
except when n = &#8722;1. It follows that the antideriv ative of 1/x is not a power, but something else. 
So let us de&#64257;ne a function L(x) by &#65533; x dt L(x)= t1 
(This function turns out to be the logarithm. But recall that our approac h to the logarithm was fairly 
involved. We &#64257;rst analyzed ax, and then de&#64257;ned the number e, and &#64257;nally de&#64257;ned the logarith m as 
xthe inverse function to e. The direct approac h using this integral formula will be easier.) 
All the basic properties of L(x) follow directly from its de&#64257;nition. Note that L(x) is de&#64257;ned for 
0 &lt;x&lt; &#8734;. (We will not extend the de&#64257;nition past x = 0 because 1/t is in&#64257;nite at t = 0.) Next, 
the fundamen tal theorem of calculus (FTC2) implies 
1 L&#65533;(x)= x 
Also, because we have started the integration with lower limit 1, we see that 
&#65533; 1 dt L(1)= =0 t1 
Thus L is increasing and crosses the x-axis at x = 1: L(x) &lt; 0 for 0 &lt;x&lt; 1 and L(x) &gt; 0 for 
x&gt; 1. Di&#64256;erentiating a second time, 
L&#65533;&#65533;(x)= &#8722;1/x2 
It follows that L is conca ve down. 
The key property of L(x) (showing that it is, indeed, a logarithm) is that it converts multiplication 
into addition: 
Claim 1. L(ab)= L(a)+ L(b) 
Proof: By de&#64257;nition of L(ab) and L(a), 
&#65533; ab dt &#65533; a dt &#65533; ab dt &#65533; ab dt L(ab)= = + = L(a)+ ttt t1 1 a a

&#65533; ab dtTo handle , make the substitution t = au. Then ta 
dt = adu; a &lt; t &lt; ab = 1 &lt;u&lt;b &#8658; 
Therefore, &#65533; ab dt &#65533; u=b adu &#65533; b du = = = L(b) 
a t u=1 au 1 u 
This con&#64257;rms L(ab)= L(a)+ L(b). 
Two more properties, the end values, complete the general pictu re of the graph. 
Claim 2. L(x) &#8594;&#8734; as x &#8594;&#8734;. 
Proof: It su&#64259;ces to show that L(2n) &#8594;&#8734; as n &#8594;&#8734;, because the fact that L is increasing &#64257;lls in 
all the values in between the powers of 2. 
L(2n)= L(2 2n&#8722;1)= L(2) + L(2n&#8722;1) &#183; 
= L(2) + L(2) + L(2n&#8722;2)= L(2) + L(2)+ + L(2) (n times)&#183;&#183;&#183; 
Consequen tly, L(2n)= nL(2) &#8594;&#8734; as n &#8594;&#8734;. (In more familiar notation, ln 2n = n ln2.) 
Claim 3. L(x) &#8594; &#8722;&#8734; as x 0+ . 
&#65533;&#65533; &#8594; 
1Proof: 0 = L(1) = Lx &#183; x = L(x)+ L(1/x )= &#8658; L(x)= &#8722;L(1/x). As x &#8594; 0+,1/x &#8594; +&#8734;, so 
Claim 2 implies L(1/x) &#8594;&#8734;. Hence 
L(x)= &#8722;L(1/x) &#8594; &#8722;&#8734;, as x &#8594; 0+ 
Thus L(x), de&#64257;ned on 0 &lt;x&lt; &#8734; increases from &#8722;&#8734; to &#8734;, crossing the x-axis at x = 1. It is 
conca ve down and its graph can be drawn as in Fig. 1. 
This provides an alternativ e to our previous approac h to the exponential and log functions. 
Starting from L(x), we can de&#64257;ne the log function by ln x = L(x), de&#64257;ne e as the number such that 
xL(e) = 1, de&#64257;ne eas the inverse function of L(x), and de&#64257;ne a x = e xL(a).

We want to &#64257;gure out the volume of a &#8220;slice&#8221; of that solid. We can appro ximate each slice as a 
disk with width dx, radius y, and a cross-sectional area of &#960;y2 . The volume of one slice is then: 
dV = &#960;y2dx (for a solid of revolution around the x-axis) 
Integrate with respect to x to &#64257;nd the total volume of the solid of revolution.

First, graph these functions and &#64257;nd the crossing points (see Figure 3). 
y +2 = x = y 2 
y 2 &#8722; y &#8722; 2=0 
(y &#8722; 2)(y +1) = 0 
Crossing points at y = &#8722;1, 2. Plug these back in to &#64257;nd the associated x values, x = 1 and x = 4. 
Thus the curves meet at (1, &#8722;1) and (4, 2) (see Figure 3). 
There are two ways of &#64257;ndin g the area between these two curves, a hard way and an easy way. 
Hard Way: Vertical Slices 
If we slice the region between the two curves vertically , we need to consider two di&#64256;eren t regions. 
x = y2
y = x &#8722; 2
(1,&#8722;1)(4, 2)

(0, -2)dx
2 Figure 4: The intersection of x = yand y = x &#8722; 2. 
Where x&gt; 1, the region&#8217;s lower bound is the straigh t line. For x&lt; 1, however, the region&#8217;s lower 
bound is the lower half of the sidew ays parab ola. We &#64257;nd the area, A, between the two curves by 
integrating the di&#64256;erence between the top curve and the bottom curve in each region: 
A = &#65533; 1 &#65533;&#8730;x &#8722; (&#8722;&#8730;x) &#65533; 
dx + &#65533; 4 &#65533;&#8730;x &#8722; (x &#8722; 2) &#65533; 
dx = &#65533; 
(ytop &#8722; ybottom ) dx 
0 1 
Easy Way: Horizon tal Slices 
Here, instead of subtracting the bottom curve from the top curve, we subtract the right curve from 
the left one.

Figure 7: A ball of radius a 
The equation for the upper half of the circle is 
y = a2 &#8722; x2 . 
If we spin the upper part of the curve about the x-axis, we get a ball of radius a. Notice that x 
ranges from &#8722;a to +a. Putting all this together, we &#64257;nd 
&#960;x3 2 2 4x=a a

velocity pro&#64257;le for &#64258;uid &#64258;owing in pipes is: 
v = c(R2 &#8722; r 2) 
distance v = speed = time 
rv
cR2
Rv=c(R2-r2)
Figure 7: The velocity of &#64258;uid &#64258;ow vs. distance from the center of a pipe of radius R. 
The &#64258;ow through the &#8220;ann ulus&#8221; (a.k.a ring) is (area of ring)(&#64258;o w rate) 
area of ring = 2&#960;rdr (See Fig. 8: circumference 2&#960;r, thickness dr) 
v is analogous to the heigh t of the shell.

&#64258;ow through pipe = &#960;cR4

Notice that the &#64258;ow is proportional to R4. This means there&#8217;s a big advantage to having thick pipes. 
Example 4. Dart board 
You aim for the center of the board, but your aim&#8217;s not always perfect. Your number of hits, N, at 
2radius r is proportional to e&#8722;r . 
2 N = ce&#8722;r 
This looks like: 
1
2 ry = ce-r2
Figure 9: This graph shows how likely you are to hit the dart board at some distance r from its center. 
The number of hits within a given ring with r1 &lt;r&lt;r2 is 
r2 2 ce&#8722;r (2&#960;rdr) 
r1 
We will examine this problem more in the next lecture.

Example 2. The boiling cauldron 
Now, let&#8217;s &#64257;ll this cauldron with water, and light a &#64257;re under it to get the water to boil (at 100oC). 
Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a cold day: the temp erature of the air outside the cauldron is 0oC. How much energy 
does it take to boil this water, i.e. to raise the water&#8217;s temp erature from 0oC to 100oC? Assume the 
y
x
70oC
100oC
Figure 5: The boiling cauldron (y = a = 1 meter.) 
temp erature decreases linearly between the top and the bottom (y = 0) of the cauldron: 
T = 100 &#8722; 30y (degrees Celsius) 
Use the metho d of disks, because the water&#8217;s temp erature is constan t over each horizon tal disk. The 
total heat required is 
&#65533; 1 
H = T (&#960;x2)dy (units are (degree)(cubic meters)) 
0 &#65533; 1 
= (100 &#8722; 30y)(&#960;y)dy 
0 &#65533; 1 &#65533;1 
= &#960; (100y &#8722; 30y 2)dy = &#960;(50y 2 &#8722; 10y 3)&#65533;&#65533; = 40&#960; (deg.)m3

How many calories is that? 
&#65533;&#65533;31 cal 100 cm # of calories = cm3 deg (40&#960;) 1m = (40&#960;)(106) cal = 125 &#215; 103 kcal &#183; 
There are about 250 kcals in a candy bar, so there are about 
1# of calories = candy bar &#215; 103 &#8776; 500 candy bars 2 
So, it takes about 500 candy bars&#8217; worth of energy to boil the water.
