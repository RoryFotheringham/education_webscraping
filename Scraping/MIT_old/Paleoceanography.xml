2. Two other terraces were dated as well: 
 
                 age of formation 
      -13m                   -10m  (constant-uplift elevations) 
     83 + 4               103 + 2 
     82 + 2               103 + 4 
     81 + 4   
     82 + 4                
And one more problematical one at 111 + 9.  
a. These high stands of sea level occur a few thousand years after Milankovitch precession  peaks 
(highs in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.  
3. Broecker et al. proposed to correlate these terraces with the &#948;18O record; they argued that the 
Emiliani/Rosholt time scale was in error. [A few years later, Shackleton and Opdyke placed this 
&#948;18O record in a paleomagnetic time scale and sealed this age assignment].  
4. More recently, Edwards, Chen, and Wasserburg (1986) have redated some of the Barbados corals 
using mass spectrometry.  They obtained ages of 122.1 + 1.1, 122.7 + 1.3, and 124.5 + 1.3 kyr for 
the major terrace; these ages agree quite well with Broecker et al.'s alpha counting dates.  
5. Older high stands are indicated as well (e.g. ~200 kyr bp)  
E. Broecker and Van Donk (1968): Proposed to use the 124 kyr date of what Shackleton dubbed "stage 
5e" in core V12-122 to extrapolate the age of the most penultimate "termination" as 127,000 kyr 
("termination II").

                                                       133 + 10

1. 2.5 m/kyr elevation rate, so there are many terraces above sea level, including some where sea 
level is 40m or so below present -day sea level at around 30-40 kyr. (-28m for 60 kyr; -38m for 42 kyr; -41 for 28 kyr).  Many older terraces as well. 
 
2. (More or less) confirms the two lower Barbados stands, although there is the troublesome older 
ages "140" kyr (and there do appear to be two separate terraces within this group). Nonetheless, agreement is reasonable for sea-level of the "82" and "105" terraces, assuming constant uplift on both islands. 
 
3. Edwards, Chen, and Wasserburg (1986) have dated two New Hebrides coral samples (a "5e 
doublet" reef complex) that had been dated at 141 +16 kyr by alpha counting.  The new mass 
spec. ages were 129.9 +1.1 and 125.5 +1.3 kyr.  While these are a bit older than the Barbados 
dates, they are not so deviant as the 141 kyr date made them seem to be.  More recent measurements indicate that many samples give ages near 134 kyr (Stein et al., 1993).  Larry Edwards (personal communication) argues that the New Guinea terraces are particularly susceptible to diagenetic alteration because of the high rainfall, and that he prefers to disbelieve the New Guinea dates and accept the Barbados dates.

III. "Direct" approach: sample shells  on the continental shelf that can be dated by 14C (or peat bogs, trees, 
which say that sea level was below a certain level). In the late 1950's and 1960's, many marine geologists 
obtain grab samples from the continental shelf and attempted to construct sea-level curves.     (e.g. Curray in the late 50's and early 60's; Milliman and Emery in the late 60's)

A. These studies generally  show lowered sea level towards 18K BUT 
1. Large scatter at individual age  
2. Was sea-level comparable to that of the present at 30 kyr? (this seems contrary to the the evidence 
provided by &#948; 18O). Possible explanations:  
a. Real variations in relative sea level?  
i. Tectonics 
ii. Polar shift (surface imbalance)  
b. Problems with samples? e.g. displacement of shells; erroneous dates (e.g. modern 14C 
contamination; problems with carbon-14 dating tool?  
c. Or some very basic misunderstanding/mis-assumption?  
 B. In-place indicators (e.g. coral reefs) seem more reliable than movable materials.  Stable coastlines 
(especially stable oceanic islands) are of coarse preferable from this point of view.  
I V. 14C dating (Part I). 
A. 14C: produced by cosmic rays -&gt; neutron -&gt; 14N -&gt; 14C + proton; production rate is proportional to 
14N and cosmic ray flux; affected by solar wind and earth's magnetic field.  
1. 14C t1/2  = 5730 years. However, by convention , 14C dates are reported relative to a reported 5570 
year half-life! (so as not to divide the literature between dates that are not consistent with the 
currently-accepted half life, and those that are).  
B. If (14C/12C) in the atmosphere is constant, if the object to be dated obtained its carbon directly from 
the atmosphere, and if the object to be dated is closed, then 
                    dN  =  -&#955;N 
                     dt 
                      N/No =  e-&#955;t

GLOBAL VISCOELASTIC MODELS 
 
I. Introduction: shell position vs. initial absolute depth; local vs. eustatic sea level; crustal rebound, 
continental tilting, and global isostatic adjustm ent; down-slope m ovem ent of shells.  
II. Recall: &#8710; &#948;18Oforam  is a function of ice-volum e, isotopic com position of ice m asses, local  salinity, 
and tem perature; probably m ore a reflection of ice volum e rather than changes in ice isotopic 
composition, local salinity, or tem perature; but how can  we be m ore specific?  To som e extent, paleo-
ecological tem perature estim ates help support this notion, but they do not appear to be sufficiently 
reliable to constrain sea-level change with confidence.  
A. Relation between &#948;18O and sea-level:

B. Glaciologists believe that the area of an ice sheet is not linearly related to its volum e; instead, V 
&#945; A1.5 .  
C. A floating icecap  would not significantly change sea level, while it would change the m ean isotopic 
composition of the ocean.  
D. So it seem s that the m ost reliable constraint on sea level would be provided by reliable paleo-
shoreline evidence.  </text>

B. The "poetic" Norwegian Sea &#948;18O stack  
 If there was som e site where we knew  that tem perature did not change, then this site could be 
used to assess relative  temperature changes elsewhere.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to know  that 
temperature did not change.  One constraint occurs in places where the tem perature is near the 
freezing point of seawater.  It can' t get any cold er, although it m ight have becom e warm er.  It has 
been argued on various grounds (Labeyrie et al., 1987) that except for the m ost severe 
glaciations, NADW  form ation occurs in the Norwegian/Greenland Sea.  In that case, the water 
must have been near the freezing point (as it is today), so that the tem perature m ust have 
remained constant. A som ewhat poetic "stack" of several N/G sea records was reconstructed (and 
incorporated with the oxygen isotope and sea level constraint for the last glacial m aximum) to 
obtain a continuous estim ate for the m ean oxygen isotope com position of seawater. (the poetry 
involved how the cores were stacked, as the us ual 5a-5b-5c-5d-5e sequence was not clearly 
evident in m ost of the records). 
 
C. Sea level and chronology for the past 120,000 years: the state of the art as of 2006. Cutler et al. (2003)

VIII. Reconciliation of  sea level and &#948;18O: tem perature and ice volum e  
A. If we assum e that the discrepancy between &#948;18O and the various sealevel indicators is due to the 
effect of tem perature on ice volum e, then we can reconstruct paleo-deep-tem perature histories from  
benthic &#948;18O, which im plies that the deep ocean was colder by anywhere from  1.5&#176;C (Pacific) to 
3.0&#176;C (Atlantic).  
1. Most of this cooling appears to have taken place going from  oxygen isotope stages 5e to 5d, and 
the greatest warm ing going from  stage 2 and 1.  The rest of the tim e the tem perature variations 
have been m ore subtle; i.e., the deep ocean m ust generally  have been about 2&#176;C colder than it is 
at present.  This is known because the uplifed coral terraces suggest that sea level change 
between stages (5a,5c) and 5e was only 10-20m , but benthic &#948;18O would have a sea-level change 
equivalent to m ore than 40m .  So even though the sea level was not very m uch different during 
stages 5a,b and 5e, the deep sea tem perature was about 2&#176;colder. 
 
2. Recently Chappell et al. (1996) have shown that the original New Guinea sea level estim ates were 
flawed by an error (the elevations of one transect  were confused with that of another), and have 
remeasured the 230Th/U ages and m ade revisions to the tim ing of the sea level highs. Note that 
the &#8220;sea level from  &#948;18O&#8221; curve is based on taking the &#8220;sm oothed&#8221; difference between the 
planktonic RC17-177 record (Shackleton) and th e benthic V19-30 record, and determ ining the 
difference; i.e., this O18 based sea level record is based on the assum ption that there is no 
temperature (or local salinity) tem poral signal in RC17-177.

1. An interesting sidelight of this process is that estimates for how fast modern sea level is rising 
must take into account this crustal rebound and the associated mantle flows.  
2. The ongoing rebound can be estimated from precise surveys; ancient rebound can be estimated by 
(14C) dating shells of organisms that grow in the shallow seashore.

2. This problem  leads to a "practical" lim it of 25,000 years for m aterial that was not collected and 
processed by careful workers.  If you don' t know who did the work and how careful they are 
likely to be, distrust all ages older than 25,000 years, and allow a few thousand years potential 
error at all ages older than about 18,000 years.  
3. Therefore: The 30K high stand reconsidered: BS!  
4. In the use of continental shelf indicators, 14C to reconstruct sea levels. the problem s of the wide 
range of values at glacial m aximum and appare nt high stand 30-35 kyrBP can be attributed to 
modern  14C contam ination of m uch older m aterial.  Nonetheless, we would still like to know 
something about older sea level changes.  
D. There is a lot m ore to the 14C story (to be covered later).

B. U (VI) is relatively soluble in seawater (carbonato com plexes: e.g. UO 22+CO32-; UO 22+(CO 32-)2), 
occurs at about 13 nm ol/kg (2.3 dpm /kg), and appears to be conservative.  230Th is particle-reactive ; 
i.e. it tends to attach to surfaces rapidly, and so it is rem oved from  seawater on a tim e scale of ~30 
years.  Hence it occurs at fairly low concentrations in seawater (&lt;0.1 dpm /100kg at the surface; ~1 
dpm/100kg in deep waters).  
C. Corals incorporate uranium  (~2ppm ) but very little 230Th.  
D. Assum ptions for 230Th dating  
1. Closed system  : except for radiodecay and production, no uranium  or thorium  enters or leaves the 
object.

D. One of the remaining problems in interpreting foraminiferal &#948;18O records is the role of local salinity 
(and isotopic) variations in contributing to individua l isotopic records.  (Not to mention the role of 
temperature- or depth- related fora minifera and flux-rate effects...)  
I X. Sea level, isostasy, and the viscoelastic earth. 
A. Eustatic vs. Relative Sea level changes  
1. Relative sea level is what you measure: the position where the sea meets the land (relative to some 
benchmark). Relative sea level includes a component of the vertical movements of the land.  
2. Eustatic sea level is the level of the ocean corrected for the vertical movements of the land &#8211; and generally 
assumed to be the same everywhere on earth (except for some corrections &#8211; see later).  </text>

7. Although m olluscs also incorporate uranium , they cannot be dated because they behave as an open 
system  for uranium .  
8. Foram inifera contain very low levels of U (~0.015ppm ), so they are not good candidates for U-Th 
dating.  If one could clean excess Th com pletely from  the surfaces (a very difficult task) and 
could get enough m aterial, it m ight not be im possible. But a study of 234U/238U in forami nifera 
[Henderson and O&#8217;Nions, 1995] suggests that they have excess 234U &#8211; com plicating any efforts 
to calculate a 230Th age.

Model for reef terrace formation. In this hypothetical example, reef tract no. 1 forms around Barbados 
during interglacial high sea stand no. 1. Emergence of reef tract no.1 takes place during an interval of lowered sea level which has a duration of 25,000 years. Interglacial high sea stand no.2 attains the same worldwide level as high sea stand no.1, but, relative to Barbados, high sea stand no.2 appears to be 25 feet lower, due to gradual tectonic uplift of the island at about 1 foot per 1,000 years. Therefore, the record 
of the eustatic oscillation is the addition of a 25-foot reef terrace to the coral cap.Rate of Tectonic Uplift ~~ 1 FT.

1. Uplift-corrected sea level of 80, 105 stands is the same as that found on Barbados. Hence it 
appears that we must take the sea level change seriously (unless we are willing to consider the 
possibility of globally synchronous uplift!).  
 2. While the older high stand seems a bit older than the Barbados terraces, it has not yet been 
confirmed by mass spec. measurements.  Probably not worth worrying about just yet.  
V II. Sea level over the past 20,000 years: submerged Barbados drill samples. 
A. Fairbanks (1989) drilled three cores into the submerged terraces off Barbados.  The corals were dated 
by 14C.  He obtained a good sea level curve for this period; the maximum sea level lowering he 
found was 120 + 5 m (ignoring one older, deeper sample of a species which he thought might survive 
significantly below sea level.  Two major rapid rises occur between the core breaks; could this be 
real or indicate an artifact?  </text>

the decay of the initial excess.  The com plete equations for calculation of 230Th ages are:

D. A third com plication: the earth is som ewhat like a toothpaste tube: if you squeeze it in one place, it 
tends to pop up som ewhere else!  
E. These considerations lead to the use of visco-elastic m odels of the earth' s interior.  Basically, 
removing water from  the ocean basins causes them  to start m oving up a little bit (because of the 
decreased overburden of water).  Putting the ice sheets on Europe and North Am erica of course 
causes the underlying continent to sink significantly (e.g. ice sheets were about 5 km  maximum 
thickness; density of ice ~1 and m antle ~3, so continent m ust sink about 5/3 km ) and to flex near the 
margins.  The displaced m antle then flows elsewhere, causing other places to m ove up.  This all takes 
place on a finite tim e scale by laws of fluid dynam ics, and depends heavily on the viscosity 
(structure) of the m antle (in fact, the only way we know  the viscosity of the m antle is from  studies of 
the rates of crustal rebound).  All of this is reversed as the ice m elts.  Most of the isostatic adjustm ent 
occurs within a few thousand years, but there are parts of Hudson' s bay that are still rebounding at 
rate of 1 m /century.

Ice core evidence for climate change  
 
I. Polar ice caps: characteristics and flow behavior 
 
 
 
Vertical cross section of an ice sheet resting on a horizontal subsurface. Ice particles deposited on the snow
surface will follow lines that travel closer to the base the farther inland the site deposition. An ice mass formed around the divide (I-I) will be plastically deformed (thinned) with depth as suggested by the lined areas. Thedashed curve along the vertical ice core (C-C) shows the calculated horizontal velocity profile V
x (Weertman 
1968b). The horizontal arrows along C-C show the adopted approximation to V x (Dansgaard et al. 1969).y

I I. Chronology 
A. Annual counting  
1.In the upper part of the ice, annual variati ons in O and H isotopes can be used to count 
annual layers.  As the ice gets older, molecular diffusion blurs the cycles and they 
become ambiguous, hence limiting O18 cycle count ing to the upper portion of the core 
(~1000 years or so, depending on accumulation rate ).  At low accumulation rates (e.g. 
South Pole), annual cycles are not at all usef ul; at higher accumulation rates (e.g. Dye 
3), annual &#948;18O cycles can be discerned back as far as 3,000 years.  
2. Other indicators can show seasonal cycles:  
a. dust 
b. chemical constituents (major ions) 
c. physical properties, such as electrical conductivity 
d. summer "hoar frost" formation (visually apparent on a light table) 
e.  Since these properties do not diffuse (significantly), they can record older layers 
than can &#948;18O.  
3. Any annual counting method will have some ambigui ties that may lead to slight over-and 
under- counts.  
B. Flow models. Based on approximations of the physical equations driving ic e flow. These may be decent, but they 
depend on a good knowledge of boundary conditions and their tempor al evolution. These work best when used with 
chronological spikes deep in the record &#8211; the model helps &#8220;interpolate&#8221; between the chronological spikes.  </text>

1.. The solubility pump: CO2 is m ore soluble in cold wate rs than in warm waters.  If 
alkalinity were uniform  throughout the ocean and if both cold and warm  surface 
waters equilibrated their p CO2 with the atmosphere, then  cold surface waters would 
have a higher dissolved carbon dioxide conten t than warm  surface waters.  As these 
cold surface waters circulate into the deep interior of the ocean, then deep waters 
will have m ore CO 2 than warm surface waters.  
2. The biological pum p: organism s rem ove carbon and nutrient elem ents from  the 
surface ocean (which is equilibrated with atm ospheric oxygen; note oxygen 
solubility is a function of tem perature); the debris from  these organism s sinks 
and decom poses, releasing carbon and nutrien t elem ents into the deep water and 
consum ing oxygen.

B. Paired Cd- &#948;13C evidence suggests that m uch of the global &#948;13C change is due to P-free 
carbon (trees and soils).  
V. Pre-form ed phosphate scenario (Toggwe iler and Sarm iento,  1984,1985; Wenk and 
Siegenthaler, 1984,1985; Ennever and McElroy, 1984,1985)  
A. One unrealistic feature of the two-box ocean  is that not all of the phosphorus is 
removed before water that upwells at high la titudes is cooled and returned to the deep 
sea as bottom . About 1/3 of all deep ocean phosphorus arrives advectively rather than 
by particulate transfer.  In effect, this ma kes the deep ocean "leaky" with respect to 
CO2, so that atmospheric CO 2 levels are higher than they would be in the absence of 
this "leak".  Factors that change the "leak iness" of the deep ocean carbon dioxide can 
change atmospheric CO 2  
B. Another unrealistic feature of the two-box o cean is that warm  surface waters do not fill 
up most of the deep ocean; in stead, cold surface waters at high latitudes sink to fill up 
most of the ocean. This aspect bri ngs m ore oxygen into the deep sea.  
C. So it is more realistic to have the d eep ocean in communicati on with a cold surface 
ocean which contains residual phosphorus.

1. Definition of pre-form ed phosphate: PFP = P - r AOU(T)  
where    r = &#8710;O2:&#8710;P "Redfield ratio" 
and    AOU = Apparent oxygen utili zation (equil. sol. - observed O 2)  
2. Calculation of m agnitude of CO 2 changes for a given PFP change.  
3. Ways to change pre-form ed phosphate:  
a. Change relative exchange rates of warm  surface and deep ocean with cold polar.  
b. More biological productivity in cold polar surface waters (?why? Martin iron

2. Model predicts large pH increase in d eep ocean.  This may be verifiable by boron 
isotope paleo-pH method.  
3. One caution: the published version of this paper relies on a version of the calcium 
carbonate dissolution kinetics that assumes that the dissolution rate varies as the 4th 
power of the undersaturation. More recent evidence discussed by Hales (&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;)   Figure by MIT OpenCourseWare. Adapted from source: Broecker (Glacial World According to  Wally) concept from Archer and Maier-Reimer.</text>

c. Change nutrient content of thermocline and hence upwell water of different 
nutrient content at high latitudes.  
D. Advantages/Disadvantages of this theory:  
1. Advantage: can produce rapid CO 2 changes 
2. Advantage: consistent with benthic-planktonic &#948;13C evidence 
3. Disadvantage: doesn't solve oxygen problem 
4. Disadvantage: there is no evidence that  PFP changes! (high latitude planktonic Cd 
does not change, and planktonic &#948;13C actually gets more negative)  
E. Multi-box steady-state ocean modeling using linear matrix methods: Ocean Box 
Modeling.  
VI. Coral Reef hypotheses  
A. Basic premise is that CaCO 3 precipitation leads to release of CO 2:  Ca ++ + 2HCO 3- = 
CO2 + CaCO 3 , and that a rise in sea-level will increase the growth opportunities for 
corals.  
B. Keir-Berger w/"Worthington's Lid": this eff ect is enhanced by formation of a meltwater 
lid that keeps much of the released CO 2 in the mixed layer/atmosphere (hence coral 
growth rates don't have to be especially high).  Snag: no evidence that deep ocean 
ventilation rates were cut off during deglaciation (recall: benthic-planktonic 14C 
difference).  
C. Opdyke version (Holocene coral growth ra tes greater than input from weathering).  
Coral growth rates are not likely to be this high, and the continuation of this 
phenomenom for 10,000 years would drive the deep ocean into a state of intense 
carbonate undersaturation.   
VII. Nutrient deepening/alkalinity response model (Boyle, 1988).  
A. Recall that one of the results of the paleo- deep water studies is that glacial P and &#948;13C 
distributions change to move nutrients fro m the upper ocean into the deepest parts of 
the ocean.  Since CO 2 is a weak acid, this movement of CO 2 into the deep ocean will 
make the deep ocean more corrosive to CaCO 3 (i.e., deep [CO 3=] will go down).  
B. As Broecker (1982) pointed out, if weat hering input and deep-sea biological carbonate 
production remains constant, then in order to  maintain the CCD/lysocline at the same 
position, the deep [CO 3=] must remain approximately constant.  If there is more CO 2 in 
deep waters, then to keep [CO 3=] constant, then the alkalinity will have to rise.  This is 
achieved by dissolving some of the CaCO 3 on the seafloor:  CO 2 + CaCO 3 = Ca ++ + 
2HCO 3-.  Note that this reaction increases the alkalinity of the whole ocean by two 
&#181;eq/kg for every &#181;mol/kg of CO 2 added from dissolution.  Hence the ratio of 
Alk/&#931;CO2 in the whole ocean increases, pH rises, and pCO 2 drops.  
C. A complication of this model is that CO 2 may not be transferred vertically 
independently of alkalinity; in some scenarios, the [CO 3=] response is small (e.g. 
versions that increase vertical mixing be tween the surface and intermediate depth </text>

nucleic acids (H 3PO4 bearing). In reality, a broad mixture of compounds occur, 
and the stoichiometry of O 2:C in particular &#8710;O2/&#8710;C in deep ocean waters 
implies a higher value (~165, because of more hydrocarbon-like functional 
groups): 
 
(CH 2O)111(CH 4)11(NH 3)16(H3PO4) + 165 O 2 = 122 CO 2 + 16 HNO 3 + 149 H 2O + H 3PO4 
 
Note the production of nitric and phosphoric acid in this process; this acid creates changes in alkalinity. Once you ac knowledge this process, you also need 
to take into account another effect that  reduces the acid effect on alkalinity by 
about 1/3: the presence of ion-exchanged carboxyl groups: 
 
(CH 2O)102(CH 4)14(HCOO-Na+) 6(NH 3)16(H3PO4) + 165 O 2  
= 122 CO 2 + 16 HNO 3 + 146 H 2O + H 3PO4 + 6 NaOH   
 
 There is intense debate on whether the C:P and N:P stoichiometries are 
fundamental to marine ecosystems, or whether there is some plasticity (e.g., 
could N:P = 25?). (There is less debate  on variable C:N ratios than for C:P). 
 
We should also note that some organisms precipitate inorganic shells out of 
calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and silica (SiO 2.nH2O). For example for every 106 
organic carbon atoms converted to organic matter, about 22 CaCO3 molecules 
are precipitated (ocean-wide average).

suggests that this formulation is in error and that dissolution rate is linear with 
undersaturation. It would be interesting to know how sensitive this model is to 
changing this assumption.  
4. One major flaw of this model is that it predicts that essentially the whole ocean floor 
(including the deep Pacific) should be covered by calcium carbonate during glacial times. This is not observed. 
 
IX. R. Keeling "sea ice/gas exchange mechanis m: proposes that LGM sea ice cover over the 
Antarctic prevented the CO2 "leak" in the S outhern Ocean. Problem: sea ice cover must 
be extremely efficient (&gt;95%) for this mechanism to work.  
X. Nitrate as a limiting nutrient: the idea and its development  
A. McElroy et al. proposed that instead of changes in oceanic phosphorus, nitrate changes 
could control glacial/interglacial CO 2 cycles. The reason for an  increase in nitrogen in 
the glacial ocean would be a decrease in denitr ification (perhaps due to lower sea-level, 
although other causes may also produce this effect). Because nitrate has a residence 
time of about 104 years (compared to 105 years for P), it is easier to change the oceanic 
N value on G/I timescales.   
B. This idea was initially discounted on two grounds:  
1. Redfield argued that P, not N, is the limiting nutrient in seawater because it is only 
supplied and lost through geological interactions (dissolution from rocks, loss to sedimentation). Nitrogen, on the other hand, is dominantly fixed biologically 
(nitrogen fixers), and if the supply of N is not sufficient, the ecological balance 
would be shifted towards nitrogen fixers, and the nitrate supply would &#8220;catch up&#8221; 
with the available phosphorus. 
 
2. Altabet and Curry showed that it did not appear that the isotopic composition of 
oceanic nitrogen changed on G/I timescales. This was taken as evidence against a 
large decrease in denitrification duri ng glacial times, because water column 
denitrification is accompanied by a large isotopic fractionation. However, recent 
studies by Brandes and Devol (1997) indicate that continental shelf sedimentary 
denitrification does not produce an isotope shift.  
C. This idea has been recently revived (in somewhat modified form) given the following 
arguments:  
1. Falkowski has argued that the Redfield argument is wrong because it does not take 
into account another limiting nutrient: iron. Redfield derived his arguments from terrestrial studies (Hutchinson), where Fe is not limiting. However, in the ocean in 
many environments, iron is limiting &#8211; in some cases to all marine life, and perhaps 
almost everywhere with respect to nitr ogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is an iron-
intensive biochemical process. Hence n itrate, not phosphate might be the limiting 
nutrient. 
 
2. It is not clear that a reduction in denitr ification will necessarily be reflected in a 
change in the isotopic composition of ocean ic nitrate. Studies by Devol and Brandes 
show that continental margin sediments &#8211; where nitrate is comp letely depleted at </text>

          <text> 21
some depth in the sediment due to denitrification &#8211; do not evidence any isotopic 
fractionation in nitrate because the nitrat e is completely consumed within the 
sediments. Although a very small isotope fractionation may remain &#8211; due to the 
difference in the diffusion of 15NO 3- (63 amu) compared to 14NO 3- - (62 amu) &#8211; the 
large isotope fractionation due to  denitrication has little effect.  
D. Studies of the nitrogen isotope composition of continental margin sediments off of 
Mexico (Ganeshram et al., 1995) and in th e Arabian Sea (Altabet et al., 1995) show 
lighter nitrogen; this is interpreted as implying less efficient glacial water column 
denitrification in these environments.  
E. Denitrication today appears to occur roughly equally on continental shelves and in the 
low-oxygen zones of the Eastern Tropical Pacifical Pacific. If both of these sinks was 
diminished, and the supply of fixed nitrogen enhanced by the greater iron supply in the 
dusty glacial atmosphere, then the nitrate content of the ocean may well have been 
higher. The fly in this ointment: how will we ever establish that this happened (paleo-
nitrate indicators being in limited supply).  
F. Studies of the nitrogen isotopic composition of Antarctic sediments and diatoms 
(suggesting somewhat more efficient nitrate utilization) have also revived the polar nutrient hypothesis to some extent. 
 
XI. Toggweiler "change in mode of Southern Ocean deepwater formation" model (personal 
communication, 2002). Premise is that in the ocean today, AABW formation occurs on the continental shelf after nearly complete equilibration of the surface water with atmosphere 
(hence CO
2 is "lost" from ocean to atmosphere). He proposes that during the last glacial 
maximum, deepwater formation proceeded by deep ocean convection (short-lived uniform 
column of high density water from surface to  bottom) where gas exchange equilibration 
cannot occur - hence sealing off the ocean CO 2 "leak" and reducing atmospheric CO 2.  
XII. Oceanic Si reorganization (Brzezinski et  al. 2002): Argue that higher glacial Southern 
Ocean iron leads to lower (1:1 compared to 4:1 today) Si(OH) 4:N ratios in glacial 
Antarctic phytoplankton (because diatoms make th inner shells when they are iron-replete: 
Hutchins and Bruland, 1998). This leads to more Si(OH) 4 in sinking Antarctic water 
masses and hence more Si in the low latit ude ocean: hence leading to more diatoms 
relative to coccolithophores in the low latit ude ocean, weakening the carbonate pump and 
increasing the depth of organic matter remine ralization (diatoms sink faster than other 
forms of organic matter). Taken all together , these factors are estimated to lower CO 2 by 
as much as 60 ppm.

Assum ing deviations within the range of va lues likely to be found in the ocean, the 
relationship can be expressed as a sim ple cubi c equation which has an exact solution. Since 
the relative am ount of the various CO 2 species is a function of the pH, we can com pute the 
absolute amount of each species as f(pH)* &#931;CO2; or directly as f(Alk, &#931;CO2). The best 
formulation for CO 2 system calculations under natural conditions  is to solve the cubic 
equation for the hydrogen ion where Alk, &#931;CO2, and borate are taken into account:  
1. Let A = Alk /&#931;CO 2 and B = &#931;B/&#931;CO 2, let [H+] = the activity of hydrogen ion, and 
let K 1', K2', and K B' be the apparent constants in  seawater at the appropriate 
temperature, pressure, and salinity; then:  
2.  0  =  [H +]3  A  
+ [H +]2 [K1'(A-1) + K B'(A-B)]   
+ [H +] [K 1'KB'(A-B-1) + K 1'K2'(A-2)]   
+ [K 1'K2'KB'(A-B-2)]   
E. A quick approxim ate solution to the carbonate system  can be obtained by com bining 
the equations for K 2' and K B':  
[B(OH) 4-] / [CO 3=] =  (K B'/K2') ([B(OH) 3]/[HCO 3-]   
and noting that the ratio [B(OH 3)/[HCO 3]- &#8226; 1/6 does not vary m uch throughout 
the ocean, (and (K B'/K2')  3), so:  
[B(OH) 4-]  &#8226; [CO 3=] / 2  
and hence (noting that CO 2(aq) is sm all and so are its variations (17&#177;10):

1. Piston Velocity concept.   If we look at the dimensions of the above equation, it has 
dimensions of distance per time.  One can think of this process as if  imaginary 
pistons were moving through the water co lumn and simultaneously pushing gas in 
and out of the ocean.  This "piston" has a velocity magnitude of about 2000 m/yr!  
2. For gases like oxygen and nitrogen, whic h equilibrate entirely between the gas 
phase and the dissolved aqueous form, gas exchange is very effective and surface 
waters are almost at equilibrium.  For carbon dioxide however, where the dissolved 
aqueous gas equilibrates with the bicarbona te and carbonate ions which occur at 
much higher concentrations, gas exchange  takes much longer and surface waters 
are usually out of equilibrium with the atmosphere - sometimes by up to a factor of 
two.  </text>

to B(OH) 4-)  
D. Relevant equilibria ("apparent" thermodynamic constants). Beca use seawater is a &#8220;high ionic 
strength&#8221; solution (i.e., it is very salty), conventional thermodynamic constants (activity 
coefficients, etc.) are difficult to define becaus e of strong ionic interactions. But because the 
composition of seawater (for major ions) is constant save for variations in total salt content, we can adopt &#8220;apparent constants&#8221; which in corporate the activity coefficients and ion 
interactions into the &#8220;appare nt&#8221; constant (denoted by &#8216;):

These apparent constants are functions of temperature, salinity, and pressure. 
 
E. Once the system of equations relevant to a problem have been set up (and these may include 
mass balance, alkalinity, or other constraints), they are solved generally by computer, where 
the underlying method involves substituting terms to create a single polynomial equation with 
[H+] as the only variable. This equation is then solved with Newton-Rapson or similar 
method. For the range of values appropriate fo r seawater, simplifications can be made that 
reduce this system of equations to a cubic polynomial with an exact solution. D. By </text>

ocean) while in others it is much larger (e .g., an increase in the fraction of organic 
matter that decomposes in th e deep ocean as opposed to th e intermediate depth ocean).  
D. The state of this idea: (1) it doesn't appear  that the whole ocean nutrient-deepening is 
quantitatively large enough to account for more than a fraction of p CO2 drop, even give 
given the most sensitive scenario (Boyle, 1992), and (2) the [CO 3=] = constant 
constraint may not be the best way to simulate the lysocline/CCD response; using a 
more explicit model of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor reduces the effectiveness 
of this mechanism at changing p CO2 (Emerson and Archer, 1993).  
VIII. Rain Ratio Model  
A. Exists in various incarnations.  What the ideas  have in common is  noting that there is a 
"rain ratio" of CH 2O:CaCO 3, and that this ratio may have changed between glacial and 
interglacial times (e.g. Keir and Berger, 1985).  
B. Early versions of this idea sprang from th e idea that "diatoms ar e more efficient at 
reducing surface water p CO2 than coccolithophorids".  At f ace value, this notion seems 
subtly obvious: diatoms remove only CO 2 (as CH 2O) while coccolithophorids remove 
both CO 2 and CaCO 3.  But because coccolithophorids remove two units of alkalinity 
for every CaCO 3 removed, they lower the pH and hence create a higher p CO2 for a 
given &#931;CO2 level.  However, as we saw earlier, reducing the low-latitude CaCO 3: 
CH2O rain ratio by a factor of two in the Toggweiler-Sarmiento 3-box ocean model 
had a significant response (280-&gt;271 ppmV), but not enough to account for glacial p
CO2 lowering.  Even lowering the ratio by a fact or of 4 in that model - placing the rain 
rate precariously close to the point at whic h carbonate isn't being deposited as fast as it 
is being weathered - only gives an additional 12 ppmV.  The reason for this lack of response is that a mass-conserving ocean will often take CO
2 that is removed in one 
part of the ocean pop back up in another part of the ocean, cancelling the apparent 
effectiveness of the original change.  In th is case, the upwelling of deep water to the 
high latitude ocean counters the direct effect of the low-latitude rain ratio change.  Let 
this serve as a warning about purely qualitative ideas about mechanisms controlling p
CO2.  
C. In a more subtle variation on this theme, it is noted that currently about 5 times more 
calcium carbonate is being formed by organisms than is coming in from rivers, hence 80% of the biogenic flux is dissolved.  If the rain ratio is reduced by a factor of 50% 
(biogenic = 2.5
xinput, only 60% of the biogenic flux needs to be dissolved.  Hence the 
[CO 3=] concentration of the d eep ocean can be higher, leading to higher oceanic 
alkalinity and hence lower p CO2.

model for the seafloor, holding ocean circul ation constant.  Key characteristic of

    ATMOSPHERIC CO 2, OCEAN CHEMISTRY, AND MECHANISMS OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
 
I. Recall: Ice core evidence fo r changes in atmospheric CO 2  
A. Pre-anthropogenic p CO2 was about 280 ppm V  
B. Glacial p CO2 was about 190 ppm V. Five Antarctic  ice cores give sam e num ber. 
Greenland cores agree tolerably well, but th eir high dust loading and reaction with CO 2 
leads to som e problem s.

C. In the early 1980&#8217;s, it seemed that the Dye 3 Greenland ice core showed relatively 
large, rapid (few hundred year) fluctuations in CO 2 during glacial stadial/interstadial 
fluctuations. These were not observed in th e high resolution Byrd Antarctic ice core, 
and it is now thought that these apparent high CO 2 events were artifacts due to melt 
layers or interactions with dust.  
D. So why did atmospheric CO 2 change with the glacial/inte rglacial cycles? Is the CO 2 
change a chicken or an egg in the progression of climate change?  
1. Many ideas have been proposed; almost an  equal number have been disposed (or is 
it deposed?). Speaking informally, it is as if theories on glacial/interglacial carbon 
dioxide are radioactive with two year half-lives.  
2. Despite this situation, there is much to be learned about CO2 in the ocean from those 
ideas, so a historical examinati on of them is still worthwhile.  
II.  CO 2 digression  
A. Two useful conservative  quantities (properties that mix linearly) are:  
1. &#931;CO 2 = [CO 2(aq)] + [HCO 3-] + [CO 3=]  
2. Alkalinity = [HCO 3-] + 2[CO 3=]  
                            + [B(OH) 4-] + [OH -] - [H +]  
                            + (etc...)    
a. "Alkalinity" is a device for employing a special form of the charge balance 
equation which divides ions into those th at have acid-base reactions and those 
that don't:  
e.g., in a system consisting of a solution of NaCl, MgSO 4, NaCO 3, and NaHCO 3:  
[Na+] + 2[Mg ++] - 2[SO 4=] = [HCO 3-] + 2[CO 3=] + [OH -]- [H+]  
                  = Alkalinity   
b. Adding or removing CO 2 from a water sample does not change the alkalinity 
(convince yourself of this!)  
C.  A common simplificati on is that of Broecker:  
    [CO3=] = Alk - &#931; CO2  
   This approximation is conceptually simple  but not accurate because of the neglect of 
significant contributions from borate and aqueous CO 2 .  For example, for values of Alk 
and &#931;CO2 typical of pre-anthropogenic warm surface waters (Alk=2275, &#931;CO2=1900; 
pH=8.3; pCO 2=283) and cold deep waters (Alk=2375, &#931;CO2=2260; pH=7.9): </text>

F. Carbon Isotope Fractionation: equilibri um carbon isotope fractionation between CO 2 
system species is a function of temp erature. Kinetic lags are important.  
&#948;13C and gas exchange  
A. Temperature-dependent equilibrium: fixing the carbon isotope composition of the 
atmosphere and allowing seawater to equilibrate: 
 
 25&#176;C 0&#176;C 
 
     gaseous CO 2 -6.4 -6.4 
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     aqueous CO 2 -7.6 -7.7 
 
     HCO 3- +1.5 +4.4 
 
     CO 3= -0.5 +0.8 
 
     (CaCO 3) +3.0 +0.0 
     ______ 
     &#931;CO2 +1.3 +4.1 
  
These isotope fractionation factors can be in corporated into the apparent equilibrium 
constants and then you can treat 13CO2 as a completely independent chemical 
system (apart from the pH control which is set by 12CO2).

3. Rate of exchange of CO 2 between ocean and atmosphere.   Speaking in round term s, 
we can calculate the av erage rate at which CO 2 moves across the sea surface:  
   2000 m/yr * 10 -5 moles/kg * 1000 kg/m 3 = 20 moles/m 2/yr 
 
  piston vel.   aq. CO 2 conc.   conversion factor   
   Given that the upper 75 m  of the water co lumn (mixed layer) underneath a square 
meter contains 150 m oles of carbon, fu ll equilibration for carbon isotopes (e.g. 13C, 
14C) can take some time (years).  pCO 2 equilibration takes less tim e however, 
because the pH shift induced by gas excha nge shifts the water towards equilibrium  
(e.g., if water is supersaturated  with respect to atmosphere, CO 2 is lost and pH of 
seawater rises and some aqueous CO 2 is lost to the bicarbonate pool.  Hence p CO2 
is moved towards equilibrium  both by loss of aqueous CO 2 to atm osphere and by 
loss of aqueous CO 2 to bicarbonate pool (this is related to the Revelle Factor).  
4. One square m eter of the the upper 100m  of the ocean (10 5kg) contains 200 m oles of 
carbon.  0.5% of this carbon is as dissolved CO 2, and the Revelle Factor is ~10, so 
about 200*0.005*10 = 10 m oles of CO 2 needs to be transferred to equilibrate the 
mixed layer with the atm osphere.  Sin ce the gas exchange rate is 20 moles/m 2/yr, 
the mixed layer of the ocean can equilibrate  with the atmosphere on a time scale of 
about a half-year (note however that 13C and 14C will take longer to equilibrate 
because the total carbon dioxide m ust exchange to fully equilibrate the isotopes, 
i.e., 200/20 = 10 years).  Hence the "average" anthropogenic CO 2 molecule has 
plenty of tim e to equilibrate with the m ixed-layer.

C. Comparison to data  
1. At the time, the calculated deep-sea &#948;13C change was similar to the -0.7 permil 
suggested by Shackleton (1977)  [although we  now know that the change is less, 
about -0.3 to -0.4 &#8240;]  
2. Planktonic (surface) &#948;13C does not change in model; this result was consistent with 
evidence available at the time [but data fo r planktonics had a relatively large scatter 
which raises some concerns].  
3. One major problem with this model is that it would deplete the deep-sea of oxygen. 
This outcome clearly did not happen (as proven by the existence of glacial-age 
benthic foraminifera, which are aerobic organisms).  
III. Shackleton et al. (1983) planktonic-benthic &#948;13C record  
A. Did detailed analysis of N. dutertrei  and Uvigerina  &#948;13C in the same core (V19-30).  
Subtracted the two to get surface-deep &#948;13C contrast, which determines atmospheric 
CO2, according to Broecker model.  Appears to confirm reduced CO 2 during glacials; 
however, it appears that CO 2 change occurs before  that of sea level (as indicated by 
&#948;18O)  
IV. Cd evidence:  
A. It does not appear that deep ocean Cd did not increase (Boyle and Keigwin, 1985/6; 
Boyle, 1992); Broecker theory requires +40% increase in P.  </text>

found that the degree of in-situ  dissolution increases greatly - so much so, that most 
of the deep ocean is supers aturated with respect to CaCO 3!  Hence, the balance 
between input and output of CaCO 3 is mediated by a balance between the extent of 
supersaturation and the extent of in-situ  organic carbon degradation (higher 
supersaturation leads to lower CaCO 3 dissolution, higher in-situ  organic 
degradation leads to more CaCO 3 dissolution; for a given organic degradation the 
deep ocean supersaturation moves to the point where dissolution is sufficient to 
compensate for excess of production over i nput. Notable in model is the relatively 
small change in rain ratio necessary to create large p CO2 changes.

1. North Atlantic Deep  Water flow was diminished, but did not cease (at least on time 
scales approachable for 3 cm/kyr sediment cores).  Evidence: Cd in several benthic 
species and &#948;13C in C. wuellerstorfi  show that NADW remains nutrient-depleted 
relative to Pacific Deep Water (Boyle and Keigwin, 1982; 1985/6).  
2. Intermediate-depth water in the North Atla ntic ocean was more depleted in nutrients 
than at present.  Evidence: Cd and &#948;13C in Caribbean Sea benthic forams; 
continental margin cores (East and Wester n margins); little change in nutrients at 
2100m on Mid-Atlantic Ridge (in contrast to  deeper increase) (Boyle and Keigwin, 
1987).

6. Other basins: the jury is still out.  Some special interest in the North Pacific, since 
some people have wondered if deepwater might have formed there during glacial 
times.  
I I. 14C as a deep-water and ventilation rate tracer 
A. The basic idea is simple: benthic a nd planktonic foraminifera incorporate 14C into their 
shells and hence represent deep and surface water 14C.  Since 14C decreases as a water 
mass "ages", the contrast between surface and d eep waters can be used as a circulation 
tracer.  Coexisting pairs of benthic and planktonic foraminifera from sediment cores 
allows us to do this in the past, in principle.  
B. In practice, there are some major obstacles to this idea.  The most serious are mixing, 
statistics, and dissolution.  Because a range of ages is represented by specimens, one 
must collect enough to compensate for the sampling statistics; this problem is more 
serious than for chemical tracers (because 14C always changes by a factor of two every 
5730 years, while Cd or &#948;18O may not).  Furthermore, changes in P/B abundance 
patterns and differential dissolution can creat e artifacts.  We also need to understand 
something more about the behavior of 14C on the surface of the earth. But working 
with deep sea corals (no bioturbation) or planktonic-benthic pairs from abundance 
maxima (hence minimizing the effects of biotur bation, this method leads to some very 
interesting results (Keigwin and Schlegel, 2002; Robinson et al., 2005).

Because of this temperature-dependent isot opic fractionation, gas exchange tends to 
make higher latitude waters heavier in &#948;13C (and lower latitude waters lighter). 
This gas exchange process does not affect phosphorus or cadmium, and hence is 
a potential mechanism for making the oceanic &#948;13C distribution different from 
that of P or Cd.  
Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995 proposed that the "preformed" &#948;13C distribution could 
be estimated by correcting benthic &#948;13C for deep respiration using benthic Cd/Ca 
data and assuming a Cd:C "Redfield Ratio". For this method to work, both tracers must be free of artifacts, and at the present time this cannot be 
guaranteed. 
 
E. Foraminiferal Ba/Ca as a paleoceanographic tracer  
1. Ba also has "nutrient-like" behavior in the ocean (lower in surface waters, higher in 
deep waters), but its oceanic distribution resemb les that of Si or Alk more than that of 
P or N; this distribution is explained as due to the redissolution of the Ba-Si-Alk 
tracers near or on the ocean floor  rather than shallower in th e water column as for P, N, 
Cd.  
2. Foraminiferal Ba also has a cleaning problem; main culprit is barite (BaSO 4); 
special cleaning methods need to be em ployed to remove this selectively from 
CaCO3.  
3. Benthic foraminiferal Ba correlates with  bottom water Ba, and the three species 
studied give similar Ba values; it looks like Ba will be a useful paleo tracer.  
4. Early results of Ba studies show some similarities and some differences compared to 
Cd and &#948;13C.  
F. Foraminiferal Zn/Ca (Marchitto et al. 2000,  2002). Zn is incorporated into benthic 
foraminifera but the amount depends on bot h the Zn concentration and the carbonate 
ion concentration of the bottom water.

III. 231Pa/230Th as a tracer of deep ocean ventilati on rates (Yu et al.,1996; Marchal et 
al.,2000; McManus et al. 2004). These isot opes are generated from the decay of 235U and 
234U at a precisely known rate that is uniform throughout the ocean. But 230Th is more 
"particle reactive than 231Pa (deep sea Th residence time is ~30 years whereas the Pa 
residence time is ~150 years). Hence ocean  currents such as NADW can transport 231Pa 
away from their origin to regi ons where the particle flux (and scavenging) is higher. The 
sediments of the modern North Atlantic are depleted in 231Pa/230Th as a result of this deep 
water transport of 231Pa out of the basin. Yu et al. (1996) found that the LGM Atlantic was 
similarly depleted, hence they argued that th ere must have been a net flow of NADW out 
of the basin comparable to the modern rate . Subsequent model studies (Marchal et al., 
2000) have shown that the constraint is probably a +50% estimate (i.e., NADW export 
from the Atlantic could have been as low as  50% of the present value, or 50% higher).

DEEP-OCEAN PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND OCEAN CHEMISTRY: LINKS TO 
ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE and 14C/12C 
 
I . Deep water paleoceanography 
A. In the 1970&#8217;s, it was hoped that benthic fo raminiferal populations could be used in 
"Imbrie-Kipp" mode to reconstruct deep o cean physical and chemical properties. This 
idea has been long on hope and slim on results, however.  
1. There are many more species of benthic foraminifera, but thes e are scarce compared 
to planktonic foraminifera (B/P ~ 1%).  Studies of benthic foraminifera require 
much larger samples (10g or more) and take much longer to process and identify.   
2. Benthic foraminifera do show large-scale variations throughout the present ocean, 
and temporal changes are recorded in sediment cores. The first studies were of 
necessity limited to small regions, and the temptation to overdo the planktonic 
analogy was great; hence depth-correlated ch anges in the modern ocean were at 
first attributed to temperature. (e.g. see Streeter, Schnitker studies).  
3. Subsequent work has shown that, unlike planktonic foraminifera, correlations with 
temperature do not hold globally. This lack of correlation probably is due to the 
extremely small range of va riation of temperature (a few &#176;C) in the deep ocean. 
There have been attempts to attribute th e observed variations to other deep-water 
parameters (e.g. oxygen content, carbonate saturation, or even the vaguer term 
"Uvigerina  water" which implies that something  in the bottom water controls the 
Uvigerina  population).  So far, none of these attempts has a "residence time" of 
more than a few years.  So far, benthi c foraminifera have defied a systematic 
generalization of the factors controlling their species composition. A recent paper 
by P. Loubere characterizes benthic foram census data from the Pacific in terms of 
surface productivity and deep water oxygen content.  
4. It is likely that factors other than deep water properties influence the benthic 
foraminiferal populations: e.g., food (from the surface) - a correlation between benthic foram flux and productivity has b een observed; sedimentation of non-food 
constituents; other aspects of the sedimentary environment (deep currents, grain 
size, etc.). 
 
One question of some interest to this "other factors" issue is: where do benthic foraminifera live? If they live at 
some depth in the sediment, the chemical environment they respond to can be different  from those at the bottom of the ocean: while T is the same, the chemical composition of the water,  the food sources, oxygen, etc. may 
differ significantly from that of the bottom water. (To be expanded upon later.)
  
5. Few paleoceanographic interpretations based on benthic foraminifera populations 
have survived more than a few years.  On e partial exception is the study of Streeter 
and Shackleton (1979) who used glacial increases in the Uvigerina  abundance to 
argue that North Atlantic Deep water ceas ed or drastically diminished.  Although 
the extent of the decrease is now thought to be considerably less than the </text>

the outer surfaces relative to the interior calcite.  
6. Studies by Boyle and Keigwin (1982; 1984 a,b; 1985) have shown that the &#948;13C 
results from C. wuellerstorfi  and Cd/Ca in several species including C. 
wuellerstorfi , C. kullenbergi , Uvigerina , and N. umbonifera  are consistent and 
indicate that the nutrient content of the d eep North Atlantic was about twice as high 
during the glacials as it is during the interglacials, which is consistent with a 
significant reduction in NADW, but not with cessation.  
7. Aragonitic Hoeglundina as  a deep water Cd tracer.  
8. McCorkle, Lea et al. (1995)showed that C. wuellerstorfi from very deep Pacific 
cores had lower Cd than expect ed from bottom water chemistry  
9. Marchitto (2004) confirmed that ther e was no significant temperature effect on 
benthic foraminiferal Cd in the range 4&#176;C-18&#176;C.  
D. Paired &#948;13C and Cd/Ca data as tracers of ocean circulation and chemistry.  
1. Even if both tracers contained exactly the same information, the combination of both 
(each with different own artifacts and problems) can make for a more convincing 
case when they both agree.  
2. Although both &#948;13C and Cd plot linearly against P (and hence contain similar 
information on oceanic chemical fracti onation due to deep ocean circulation 
patters), paired  data on both tracers provides more information because the slope  of 
paired isochronous data provides informati on on the Cd:P ratio of the ocean and the 
intercept provides information on the P content of the ocean. (Boyle, 1985).  
3. "&#948;13Cas" concept (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995): the role of gas exchange in 
influencing oceanic &#948;13C. At equilibrium, the d13C of seawater in equilibrium with 
the atmosphere is a function of the temperature:

least the sign was right!

2. Cd has nearly the same ionic radius as Ca; hence it is well-suited to solid-solution 
substitution  in the calcium carbonate crystal.  Chemically, at equilibrium, one 
would expect that  
           XCd           &#947;Cd fCd [Cd] 
           ___  =  Deq   ____________ 
           XCa           &#947;Ca fCa [Ca] 
 
         where: 
         X   = the mole fraction of the element in the solid 
         Deq = the equilibrium constant (distribution coefficient) 
                (determined by the relative free energies of the 
                ion in solution 
                and in the solid) 
         &#947;    = the activity coefficient of the free ion in  
                solution 
         f   = the fraction of the element that exists in solution 
                as the free ion (i.e., not complexed) 
       [ ]   = the total concentration of the element in solution 
  
         For an ideal  solid solution (i.e., where the free energy of 
         CdCO 3 is the same in solid solution in CaCO 3 as it is in 
         pure CdCO 3), Keq is equal to the ratio of the solubility  
         products of the pure carbonates K sp(CdCO3)/KspCaCO3.   
         (Most solid solutions are non-ideal, however).  
3. Although &#947;, f, and K are functions of temperat ure, their temperature dependence is 
expected to be slight, so that we expect  
         (Cd/Ca)carbonate  = D p (Cd/Ca)solution   
        where D p is the partition coefficient 
4. Determination of the e quilibrium partition coefficient is difficult (because of 
rampant disequilibrium and slow kinetics at low temperatures).  And of course, 
organisms may choose to use their energy resources to create disequilibrium 
fractionations. Best course is to use empi rical approach to see if the cadmium 
content of the foraminifera is proportional to the cadmium content of the water the 
organisms grown in.  This has been appr oached by feeding radioactive cadmium to 
planktonic foraminifera (Delaney, Be) and by looking at the distribution of Cd in 
core-top benthic foraminifera relative to  the bottom-water Cd content (Boyle, 
1988).  These studies show that the Cd c ontent of a variety of deepwater (&gt;2500m) 
calcitic foraminifera is proportional to the Cd content of the water, with 
Dp &#8776; 2.9 &#177; 0.6 . In shallower cores, the situation for Cd is more complicated. 
Coretop calibration shows that D changes with depth from ~1.3 at z &lt;1100 to D~2.9 
at z&gt;2900 m. Boyle (1992) proposed that cadmium in the water ("CdW") should be </text>

between Atlantic and Pacific records to NADW fluctuations (which would have 
therefore been a large portion of the total &#948;13C record in the Atlantic core. Zahn et 
al. (1986) showed that Uvigerina  shows variable  &#948;13C offsets from bottom water 
that are related to the organic carbon c ontent of the sediment (which they suggested  
was due to an infernal habitat for Uvig erina).  The Northwestern Africa (core 
M12392) Uvigerina  record contains a large component due to organic-carbon 
source related non-constant &#948;13C offsets for Uvigerina .  Hence the role of NADW 
fluctuations was smaller than it appeared in the 1983 paper.  </text>

estim ated from  this relationship when com paring data from  depths crossing this 
transition. Fortunately, the ar agonitic benthic foram inifera Hoeglundina elegans  
appears to little or no depth dependence for D (Boyle et al., 1995), which allows 
one to check whether the inferred depth dependence is stable. Com parison of Cd 
data from  this species and the calcitic fora minifera indicates that the calcitic depth-
dependence has rem ained constant betw een the last glacial maximum and the 
present. 
 
 
5. The m ain difficulty with this technique is  that the cadmium content of foraminifera 
is very low, ranging from less than 0.01 &#181;m ol/mol for surface planktonics to 0.23 
&#181;mol/mol for Pacific benthics.  Boyle (1981) dem onstrated that ultrasonically-
cleaned foram inifera shells contain in total 100-1000 tim es more cadm ium than is 
actually contained in the lattice. This cadm ium is contained in ferrom anganese 
coatings on the surface of the shells wh ich can be removed by a reductive cleaning 
treatm ent. In som e environm ents, preci pitation of m anganese carbonate (MnCO3) 
on the surfaces of foraminifera also leads to  excessive Cd levels; it is more difficult Image removed due to copyright considerations.

record of tem poral and spatial variati ons in C-13 [though even this species shows

c. Complication: where in the sediment do foram inifera live?  If they live at som e 
depth in the sedim ent, &#948;13C can be significantly different from  that of the bottom  
water.  
d. Complication: The average  &#948;13C of the ocean is not constant, due to a significant 
transfer of terrestrial reduced organi c into the oceans during glacial periods 
(tropical aridity and destruction of hi gh-latitude hardwood forests: Shackleton 
(1977).  This m eans that a local  downcore records of &#948;13C have a large (and 
often dom inant) com ponent due to  changes in the ocean average &#948;13C, and it is 
necessary to som ehow correct for this in determ ining the spatial &#948;13C 
distribution at a given tim e.  
3. Because of these complications, early &#948;13C studies of benthic foram inifera have been 
characterized by "incomplete interpretati ons" which were m odified later.  For 
exam ple, Shackleton (1977) attributed the C-13 changes from  Uvigerina  off 
Northwestern Africa (core M12392) (alm ost) solely to changes in the global 
oceanic &#948;13C due to a dim inished LGM soil/biospheric carbon reservoir.  
 
 
 
Note that this figure is slightly misl eading because the &#8220;Uvigerina&#8221;record is

record. It turned out later that a lot of th e C13 &#8220;signal&#8221; in this core was due to the 
variable C13 offset for Uvigerina  in high organic carbon glacial sedim ents 
(although the &#8220;continental biom ass&#8221; argum ent is still accepted as part of the benthic 
C13 record. Later, Shackleton, Im brie, and Hall (1983) attributed the difference  Image removed due to copyright considerations.

B. Carbon isotopes as a tracer of deep ocean paleoceanography  
1. The distribution of &#948;13C in the modern ocean is linked to oxygen and nutrients.  
a. Organic matter is depleted in 13C. This depletion occurs mainly during the 
enyzymatic conversion of inorganic CO 2 (itself somewhat depleted related to 
total dissolved CO 2, which is mainly HCO 3-) to organic matter by plants, mainly 
a kinetic effect.  
Much of the carbon uptake by marine photosynthetic organisms is achieved by 
the transport of free aqueous CO 2 (which is depleted in 13C by ~10&#8240;) across 
cell membranes (although there are also some ways to use anionic HCO 3- 
directly). Furthermore, because CO 2(aq) concentrations are low (10-20 
&#181;mol/kg), the cell membrane environment can be depleted in CO 2(aq) during 
rapid photosynthesis because the conversion of HCO 3- to CO 2. is relatively 
slow. Enzymatic (Rubisco) and other kinetic effects within plants add to this 12C 
depletion, resulting in the &#948;13C  of marine organic ranging from -20&#8240; (tropical 
and subtropical waters) to -30&#8240; (Antarctic).  
b. When this organic matter sinks into the deep ocean, it quantitatively decomposes 
(~99% in the whole water column; ~80% in the upper 500 m), releasing the bound C, N, and P in the same ratio, and consuming O
2 from the water in the 
process.  The CO2 released during this respiration process is depleted in 13C, so 
that the &#948;13C of the deeper water lower than that of the original surface waters.  
A plot of &#948;13C vs. P for the modern ocean is linear.  
c. Hence it is possible to use the &#948;13C distribution in the ocean  as a tracer of oceanic 
water masses.  
2. Because &#948;13C is recorded in the shells of pla nktonic and benthic foraminifera, it is 
possible to determine the nutrient distribution in past oceans.  
a. Complication: &#948;13C in forams is not in equilibrium or even close to it; in fact, 
different species have significantly different offsets from the &#948;13C of the water.  </text>

INTRODUCTION TO CENOZOIC PALEOCEANOGRAPHY 
 
I. Changing continental positions: given typical spreading rates: 
(~4 cm/yr)(10x10 6yr) = 400 km  
A. Changing shape of ocean basins  
B. So: ocean currents and property distribut ions must have been quite different in 
the distant past  
1. e.g.: Antarctic Circumpolar current  could not have been present prior to 
Australia-Antarctica separation (about 38 m.y.); Drake Passage. Isthmus of 
Panama open 10 m yr ago. Tethys (proto-Mediterranean) connected to open 
ocean.  
2. Sites of bottom-water forma tion are likely to be different.  
C. Paleocontinent reconstruction. Poles of rotation: Estimated from transform faults; 
magnetic anomalies; "hot spot" island chains; sedimentary paleomagnetism; paleoequators from sediment composit ion and deposition rate; continental 
climate indicators and igneous paleomagnetism. 
 
D. Age-depth relation and paleo-depth backtracking  
1. The depth of the seafloor (regionally av eraged) is a function of the age of the 
ocean crust.  
a. Relationship is due to conductive/advective loss of heat by lithosphere: 
thermal contraction results in density increase.  
b. Until approximately ~70 my, depth of the seafloor increases linearly with 
respect to the square root of the age of the seafloor.  
c. Beyond 70 m.y., underlying diffusion of geothermal heat in is balanced by 
heat diffusion out of the sea floor, so it does not get much deeper until it 
reaches a subduction zone.  
2. Paleo-depth backtracking  
a. In order to make oceanic reconstruc tions for the distant past, especially for 
properties such as calcium carbonate which are known to be depth-dependent, we must compute the 
paleo-depth 
b. The age-depth relationship is for the regional topography; seamounts and 
other small-scale features do not confo rm to this relationship.  Since real 
DSDP sites are going to be local, not regional, what is the best way to estimate the paleo-depth of that site?  
 
 (1) Assumption: local isostatic compensation (i.e. while the site may be 
above or below the regional average, the site will maintain its elevation difference relative to the regional average). 
 
c. Also need to correct for sediment  loading: as the site accumulates 
sediment, the seafloor is depressed isostatically by the additional loading.  </text>

          <text>d. To a first approximation, all of these things can be handled reasonably well 
by simple approximations.  
e. Aseismic Ridge problem (e.g. Rio Grande rise; Walvis Ridge)  
1. Although the origin of aseismic ridges may still be arguable, it is reasonable to 
assume that they originated on the ri dge crest as hot-spots which reached the 
surface ocean.  Normal weathering pl aned them down to the sea surface 
upon the termination of volcanic activity (as the site migrated away from the 
ridge crest), and as the seafloor subsides, the aseismic ridge subsides along 
with it.  
f. Originally, it was hoped that paleo-depth reconstructions would be useful in 
determining the age of opening of "oceanic portals" (i.e., the time at which ocean bathymetry in bottlenecks (e.g. Vema Channel; Antarctic-Australia) 
became appropriate for the passage of deep waters).  It turns out that the timing is too  sensitive to local topogr aphy to provide precise evidence; the 
geological data from DSDP sites is more informative than the paleobathymetric reconstructions.  Nonetheless, the generalized paleobathymetry provides a useful backd rop for interpreting the geological 
evidence for changes in oceanic circulation. 
 
I I. Cenozoic Time Scale 
A. Principal constraint: paleomagnetic ti me scale linked to radiometric dates  
1. Radiometric dates come from K-Ar, A r-Ar dating of lava flows, mainly (esp 
back to several million years ago).  
2. Older dates were previously mainly based on extrapolation  assuming constant 
spreading rates for a particular ridge (Hie rtzler et al. time scale). This 
assumption can be modified by supplement al radiometric dates, but these are 
few and far between (LaBreque et al; K ent et al; Berggren et al).    
3. Main problems  
a. Limited resolution: reversals typically occur every million years (on 
average; "Cretaceous Quiet Zone" has no reversals from from 90-120 
m.y.)  
b. Difficulty of recognizing reverals: all we can really say is that a given zone 
is normal or reversed; it can be difficult to know which  normal or reversed 
zone it is, particularly in discontinuous  sections (due to coring problems or 
hiatuses).  
c. Some sediments are poor recorder s of paleomagnetic records (e.g. high 
percent carbonate).  
B. Biostratigraphy: first appearance and disappearance of species  
1. Disadvantages: species appearance or disappearance may be time-
transgressive; reworking of older foss ils; selective preservation and "Lazarus 
species"  
2. Advantages: unlike on-off paleomagnetic events, these are one-time only 
events, so they immediately plac e one in a specific time frame.  </text>

People have tried K-Ar dating of ash la yers (but these have proved unreliable 
due to diagenesis); 10Be, 26Al have some uses (e.g. accumulation rates of red 
clays), but are not precise chronometers because of their geochemical behavior.  
Basaltic basement can be dated by Rb-Sr in  celadonites, but precision is limited.  
D. Sr-isotope stratigraphy  
1. Sr isotopic composition of seawater is recorded in fossil carbonates.  Since 
seawater composition changes from ~.7092 today to ~.707 at 45 m.y., Sr 
isotope curve can be used as a relati ve method of dating, with perhaps 
somewhat better than 1 m.y. time re solution.  Problems: sedimentary 
diagenesis; linkage to absolute time scale; only works for carbonate phases 
(or others which incorporate only seawater Sr).  
E. Carbonate stratigraphy: As in the Quat ernary, there are syst ematic regional 
variations in the carbonate content of sediments; hence these can be used as 
a method of cross-correlating regional co res.  Problems: the curve to be 
expected is not always well known; aliasing due to insufficient sampling frequency.  
 
F. Orbital stratigraphy: evidence for Milankov itch cycles in older sediments is taken 
as &#8220;tree ring&#8221; chronometer to at least match the pacing of obliquity/precession 
cycles, sometimes using the envelope of pr ecession and obliquity cycles. Orbital 
calculations are now &#8220;decent&#8221; back to perhaps 10-20 my, and beyond that at 
least the basic cycle lengths remain constant. Examples: Hilgen (1991), P&#228;like et al. (2001) 
 
G. Others: fish-teeth (Sr isotopes; may be open system); trace fossils  
H. At present, the most reliable stra tigraphy is based on the combination of 
paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic informati on on several classes of organisms, 
with orbital tuning, preferably in continuous, multiple hole hydraulic piston core sites.

D. Pa/Th: production ratio (atoms) = 24.5 (0.093 activity ratio). Because Th is scavenged more 
readily by falling particulate matter (res. time 20-60 yrs), Pa (res. time 200-500 yrs) tends to 
migrate to sites of high productivity, resulting in higher Pa/Th ratios in sediments under high 
productivity areas. Complication: deep water move ments are also a factor; high-production 
sites within a basin compete with each other.

III. &#948;13C of organic matter: paleo p CO2 or what?: The Rubisco enzymat ic pathway can be limited by 
available free CO 2 within a cell. As aqueous CO 2 becomes limiting, the isotopic composition of 
organic matter becomes more limited by transpor t into the cell, hence shifting the isotopic 
composition towards that of the free aqueous CO 2. One complication in using bulk organic 
matter as such a tracer is that different compounds have different &#948;13C compositions; this effect 
can be minimized by using single-compound &#948;13C. Another complication: there is also a clear 
ell size/growth rate effect as well as an external aqueous CO2 effect. c

I. Paleoproductivity and related issues 
 
A. Organic carbon preservation: preserved organic carbon is only 1-2% of new production flux. 
If the fraction preserved is constant, then t he accumulation rate of organic carbon is a 
measure of changes in new production. BUT&#8230;  
B. Barium: sinking organic matter is enriched in Ba , with a (roughly) constant Ba:org C ratio. Ba 
is preserved in sediments as BaSO 4 to a much higher extent than organic carbon (up to 
40%). Then it might serve as a better-prese rved paleoproductivity indicator. Selective 
extraction of barite (denser t han most other mineral phases&#8230;) provides a complement to 
bulk Ba, as well as a carrier phase for other elements (Ra, Sr, etc.)  
C. Nitrogen Isotopes and "nutrient utilization efficiency". Phytopl ankton preferentially take up 
14NO 3- (by about 5&#8240;). Uptake in a closed system proceeds according to Rayleigh 
distillation, with progressive enrichment of 15N in the photosynthetic product. In a high 
productivity environment with low nitrogen utilization efficiency, &#948;15N  of the photosynthetic 
product is depleted relative to seawater &#948;15N by about 5&#8240;. In an oligotrophic environment 
&#8220;what goes up comes down&#8221;, so the isotopic com position of the integr ated photosynthate is 
the same as in the upwelling NO 3-. Although there is significant further isotopic shifts on 
sinking particulate matter and during diagenetic transformation on the seafloor, the bulk 
organic matter reflects trends in nitrogen utilization in surface waters.

The net result is an effective ~22,000 year radia tion cycle. The effect of precession on radiation 
depends on the absolute eccentricity of orbit. Wh en the earth has a nearly circular orbit around 
the sun, precession of the axis produces no net ra diation change for either season in either 
hemisphere. When the earth' s orbit is more elliptical, there is a strong difference between 
radiation received between the hemi spheres and between the seasons:

6. The resolution problem :  From the definition of the fourier bands, it is obvious that 
resolution is poor for periods that are only a fe w multiples of the record length.  What is 
one to do if you want to get a higher resolution spectrum.  The safe answer is: Don't try to 
cheat mathematics: get a longer record!  There is a more dangerous alternative, however.

2. Tapering: in order to ensure that there are no abrupt m ismatches between first and last data 
points (e.g. a glacial connecting to an intergl acial with no transition), the time series can 
be tapered to zero at the begi nning and end. For exam ple, a "cosine bell" can be used for 
this purpose (a cosine maximum to minimum multiplier) for the first and last 10% of the 
data series. The subject of tapering is com plicated, and at present it is generally agreed 
that the "optimal" method is David Thomps on's "multitaper method", which blends the 
result from a family of tapers.

3. These m ethods have som e undesirable character istics. In som e cases, it m ay be preferable 
to avoid one or the other of these methods.  For example, for a low-frequency sine wave, 
detrending will tend to "pick out" the endpoint s of the time series and could produce a 
"tilted" corrected sine wave.  Best to a pply thoughtfully while visually examining the

G. At present, relatively few people doubt that orb ital changes play a role in clim ate change, but 
there are questions as to their importance relative to other factors. To what extent is climate 
actually predictable? Are there significant intern al resonances that interact with orbital 
forcing? What is the origin of large amplitude  sub-orbital climate variability? Can we parlay 
our understanding of past clim ate change into better predictions of future clim ate change?  
Some com mentary on the last question:  Clim ate m odels (to be discussed m ore later) 
incorporate a lot of first principle physics (e.g. laws of m otion and therm odynam ics) but 
because of the enormous comp lexity of the system and limited computer size and speed, 
contain less definitive representations of s ub-grid scale processe s and poorly understood 
processes (e.g. convective precipitation; sea ice form ation and m elting; relation between 
soil, vegetation, evaporation, precipitation and river runoff).  In the aggregate, these 
factors are extrem ely im portant, so they cannot  be left out. Instead they are handled by 
empirical param eterizations containing "fudge  factors" which are "tuned" to give a 
reasonable representation of m odern clim ate. This approach is OK for weather 
forecasting, because many of these factors ca n't change fast enough to effect tomorrow' s 
weather. But for climate change, these uncertainties are a serious problem . The sensitivity  
of the m odels to various forcing factors might be seriously m is-estim ated by these 
parameterizations. One way to test the sensitiv ity of these models is to see how they 
behave when driven by well-known forcing f unctions (e.g. a recent volcanic eruption). 
One of the best known forcing functions linked to  large clim ate change is the effect of the 
earth' s orbital param eters on incom ing radiation.  
II. Changes in the earth' s orbital parameters and thei r influence on radiation receipt at the top of the 
atmosphere. Root cause: gravitational interaction of  earth with sun and planet. Precession due to 
the gravitational field of the Sun, and tilt/eccentricity  variations due to Sun-Jupiter tug-of-war for 
the earth. 
 
A. The seasons result from the tilt of the earth' s axis relative to the plane of the orbit (view from

and let x = an N x 1 vector of the Fourier co efficients (a, b) arranged vertically: 
 
a1 
b1 
a2 
b2 
&#8230; 
aN/2 
bN/2 
 
   and let g = an N x 1 vector of the discrete observations of G(t): 
 
g(t1) 
g(t2) 
&#8230; 
g(tN) 
 
Because the Fourier Transform theorem says:  
(a) g = A x   
then the Fourier coefficients are given by the simultaneous equations matrix solution:  
(b) x = A-1 g  
(You might wonder if the rows must be linearly independent, ensuring that the inverse of X exists. In effect, the 
Fourier theorem is a statement that they must  be, for "reasonable" time series functions)   
2. The above method is one way to calculate the Fourier transform. However, the fastest, 
most efficient route is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) . This is a simple routine which 
calculates the solution to the se ries of simultaneous equations in a highly efficient way. It 
occupies about 64 lines of a BASIC program ; see "The Visible FFT" spreadsheet to 
understand the algorithm). Typically, you either interpolate your data to give a series with 
a power of two of evenly spaced (in time) da ta points (which usually makes sense because 
paleoclimatic data sets are usually unevenly spaced in time), or add "trailing zeroes" to 
your data set until you reach a power of two.  
3. Older papers use the method of "Blackman and Tukey" which was developed before the 
FFT. It was commonly used throughout the SPECMAP project. It is based on the 
"autocorrelation" technique, wh ich involves calculating the correlation coefficient of a 
time series relative to itself (autocorrelation) after sliding the series by a variable number 
of "lags". The methods are mathematically equivalent, however, and the results should not depend strongly on the technique used.

only 9 cycles unconvincing yet one with 11 cy cles totally convincing? Of course, the 
statistics follow a continuum, so there is little statistical difference in the reliability of 
records with 9 or 11 cycles. Perhaps a m ore fundam entally m isleading characteristic of 
these "rules" is that they ignore the relati onship between the cycle you are trying to see 
and the characteristics of the rest of th e variability. A very weak cycle (which 
nonetheless exists) can be hidden in the "noise " of the data or of the physical system ; it 
can take many more than 10 cycles to verify  the existence of a weak cycle.  On the 
other hand, the characteristics of a very str ong cycle can be estim ated reliably with just 
a few cycles (although it is another thing to  prove that those cycles couldn' t have 
originated from chance). Ba sically, these "rules" (and even the more objective 
statistical tests) are oversim plificati ons; they do not excuse YOU from  understanding 
what is required to prove the poi nt that you are trying to m ake.  
e. For the periodogram , the following statistics a pply to assess whether a peak of spectral 
density P i is higher than expected from a white noise spectrum: 
 
                             90% CI         95% CI  
            Upper Bound      19 P i         39 P i 
            Lower Bound       0.33 P i       0.21 P i  
 
Obviously these lim its are not very good!  If we are to see m ore subtle characteristics 
of the spectrum, it is necessary to improve these statistics.  
4. Estimating a spectrum  using a smoothing window  (Daniell Estimator ) 
a. As with m ost collections of numbers, we can im prove error bounds by averaging  (at the 
expense of detail).  In a power spectrum , we can average adjacent frequency bands at 
the expense of frequency resolution.    
b. Several m ethods have been proposed to  accom plish this averaging; for m ost 
geophysical tim e series, the sim plest is adequate: the Daniell Estim ator: 
 
Pj=Pj+k
2n+1 k=&#8722;nk=+n
&#8721;  
 
(Note: in order to keep the spectrum  frequency bands the sam e as the periodogram  
bands when averaging even num bers of ba nds, it is com mon to add the n-1 bands on 
either side of the central band, and add 1/ 2 of the bands on either side of these n-1 
bands).  </text>

GLACIAL/INTERGLACIAL 'OSCILLATIONS': WHY? 
Time-series analysis  
 
 We now understand something of the course of climate change over the past 700,000 years.   
Similar basic patterns are seen in most indica tors, although we can recognize that geographical 
variation is significant.  We can begin to ask the question: Why? 
Two approaches: 
 
    1. "The physics": derive ice ages from first principles.  Good luck! (call me when you get there). 
 
    2.  "Correlation (not causation)": look for similarities (coincidences?) between certain driving 
forces known from first principles and the clim ate record.  Examine the odds that such a 
correspondence is due to chance.  If the odds are good, look into the relevant mechanism in more 
detail. To be successful, this approach needs: (1) reliable climate record not excessively modified by 
bioturbation; (2) but the record also needs to be  reasonably long so that many cycles are available 
for statistical tests.  Must compromise here! Ev entually need to come to an accommodation with 
&#8220;the physics&#8221;. 
 
I. Historically: 
 
A. 1840: Agassiz proposed massive continental glaciation; debate ensued which eventually was 
decided in his favor            
B. 1860: Croll proposed that changes in the eart h's orbital parameters were responsible for 
glaciation.  Theory received a mixed reception.  
C. 1920 Milankovitch undertook detailed calculations which quantified the expected variations 
in the earth's orbital parameters. Theo ry still encountered a mixed reception.  
D. 1950's:  Emiliani found stronger evidence for cyclic oscillations; tried to revive Milankovitch.  
Problem: time scale.  
E. 1960's, 70's: Barbados data (and hence correct time scale) revived interest in Milankovitch.  
Theory was being taken seriously, but  it was considered far from proven.  
F. 1976: Hays, Imbrie, Shackleton paper.  Overcame  most of the resistance to some degree of 
orbital influence over climate (at least as a "pacemaker" of ice ages).

However, these statistics only apply to time series where the time scales are precisely 
accurate. Paleoclimatic time series are often "tuned"  to match orbital variability - in this case 
the coherence between orbital parameters and the coherence of the tuned time series is 
falsely elevated and isn't a particularly useful statistic (ref.). 
 
b. Phase 
 
error = arcsin [ [(1-coh2)/(coh2(2n-2))] 1/2 t2n-2 (&#945;/2)] 
 
where t is the t-statistic and &#945; is the desired confidence level, i.e. for 95% CI, &#945; = 1-.05. 
 
H. Another useful technique is frequency filtering  of data.  There are several ways this can be 
done; the simplest is to Fourier Transform the data, multiply the coeffi cients by multipliers (0 
to 1) (warning: multipliers should change slowly in adjacent bands; i.e. don't go from 0 to 1 in 
adjacent bands), and then perform the Inverse Fourier Transform. 
 
V. Spectral analysis of oceanic climate records.  
A. Imbrie and others made attempts many years ago, but problems with the time scale and other 
not-fully-appreciated problems (e.g. bioturbation)  precluded useful results.  The imperfection 
of the time scale degraded the statistical significance of peaks that were more significant than 
they appeared.  [This should also caution us not to always accept the criticisms about the 
appropriate significance levels for geological time series when the inherent limitations the 
time scale accuracy places on obtainable signifi cance is not appreciated.]. By the early 
1970&#8217;s, the time scale based on Barbados U/Th coral dates and linear interpolation from the 
most recent paleomagnetic reversal (Brunhes- Matuyama) in core V28-238 (Shackleton and 
Opdyke, 1973) provided a time scale that wa s good enough for the first attack on this 
problem. [Note: at the time that those papers were written, geophysicists had assigned a date </text>

1. For the earth, e varies between 0 and 0.06 quasi-periodically, with period of ~96,000 years 
and a longer (and higher-amplitude ) period of ~400,000 years.  
2. The sun is at one of the foci of the ellipse . The earth moves faster when it is approaching 
closer to the sun, and slower as it m oves away.  
3. Looking down at the solar system  from  outer  space (above the plane of the planetary 
orbits), the ellipse precesses in its orientation:

2. Given two 'records' (X,Y) each has a power spectrum  
a2 + b 2 = (a + ib)(a - ib)   
(i.e., the power spectrum is the comple x conjugate of the fourier coefficents)  
&#934;X(S) = &#931;  X(S) X *(S)  
&#934;Y(S) = &#931;  Y(S) Y *(S)  
(where * denotes complex conjugate; both &#934;X(S) and  &#934;Y(S)are real and  &gt;0)  
3. The cross-spectrum   &#934;XY is similarly defined:   
&#934;XY = &#931; X(S) Y *(S)  
  
    (aj+bji)(cj-dji) = ajcj + bjdj - (ajdj-cjbj)i  
 
                            =  C + iQ (a complex number) 
 
4. Coherence is the normalized  cross-spectrum (the cross-spec tral power normalized to the 
power of the two series) 
 
                    &#934; xy 
         coh =  _________          =  C + iQ  (a complex number)

0 &#8804; coh(x,y)  &#8804; 1 
 
a. Band-averaging must be done (same definiti on as Daniell estimator), except that when 
computing phase, you must band-average the complex numbers before computing phase 
(think of the beating  of nearby frequencies...).  This is done as complex addition of vectors 
in the phase plane

latitude of the tropics and the arctic circle.  Period is ~41,000 years, a nd is relatively regular.

D. Precession  of equinoxes.  Physics is sim ilar to  a wobbling top; the precession frequency 
depends on angular m omentum  of the earth and the torque im posed by the sun on a non-
spherical earth.  
1. Precession of the earth' s axis relative to th e fixed stars has a period of 25,700 years. The 
climatic affect (due to changes in the earth -sun distance as a func tion of season) depends 
on an interaction between the precession peri od of the earth' s axis with the precession 
period of the m ajor axis of the orbit). In ~22,000 years, the earth ends up in a 
configuration where the radiation distribution cycle is complete:

G(t) =&#8747;S( f)ei&#969;fdf
&#8722;&#8734;
(i.e. both the Fourier transform and the time series contain equivale nt "information", which 
also means that we can do frequency-filteri ng using the inverse fourier transform) 
b. The Fourier Transform of a single sine wave  is a spike at a single frequency. Similarly, 
the Inverse Fourier Transform of a si ngle spike frequency is a sine wave. 
C. Computation:  
1. Accepting the truth of the theorem, the discrete Fourier Transform is just an application of 
simultaneous equations. For discrete uni formly-sampled data, we are taking N 
observations of G(t), and converting to N/2 pairs of sin, cos coefficients. The number of 
coefficients is equal to the number of observations, so this is an exercise in solving a 
system of N simultaneous equations. Let A = an N x N square array of the sin and cos 
time series for each of the harmonics, where ea ch row of the array (for i= 1 to N) is: 
sin(2&#960;i/N) cos(2 &#960;. . . .i/N) sin(2 2&#960;i/N) sin(2 2&#960;i/N) &#8230; sin(N/2 2&#960;i/N) cos(N/2 2&#960;i/N) </text>

Note that the detrended (nearly raw) time series  shows spectral power at either side of the 
actual frequency which "isn' t really there". Tapering improves this situation, but does 
not eliminate all of the side-bands.  
b. This observation leads to a concer n over "optimal spectral estimation"  
i. The sim ple Fourier transform /periodogram  method described below works 
reasonably well for simple situations where a sm all num ber of well-separated 
dominant frequencies are present, and wh ere you are only interested in dom inant 
power at the dom inant frequencies and not at the true weak power in the gaps 
between the dominant time series.  
ii. In other situations, where you really care  about extracting the best possible estim ate 
of the true spectrum , you m ust move on to  other techniques. Argum ents have raged 
over optimal spectral estimation, but it se ems that the winner is David Thom pson, 
who has shown that the best approach is to use a "multi-taper" strategy in which 
the averaged Fourier transforms (from inde pendent spectra computed using a set of 
"eigentapers") are used to retain as much  information as possible. [Actually what 
he says is :"...spectral estimates base d on the simple periodogram or unwindowed 
FFT (or equivalently, on sample autocorrela tions) including indirect estim ates (also 
known as Blackm an-Tukey (1958) estim ates) or worse, adding m isfit to bias, the 
autoregressive or ' maxim um-entropy'  estim ates, m ust be considered both obsolete 
and extrem ely dangerous." (Thom pson, 1990) ]. This approach is beyond the lim its 
of this course, but it is the right thing to do if you m ust have the best spectra.  </text>

the aim  is to test parts of the orbital hypothesis that weren' t tuned: e.g., the 
eccentricity cycle, and other indicators th at weren' t specifically phase-locked onto 
the orbital parameters.  Also, to the extent that it is just used to examine the relative 
timing of events in different regions and of different properties using the &#948;18O time 
scale, the tuning isn' t really a factor.  Bu t there are problems: in a tuned system, the 
coherence statistic is a poor indicator and was oft-abused in the SPECMAP-era 
literature.  
C. Ruddim an and McIntyre (1981) found that (fora m Imbrie-Kipp) T near 42&#176;N in the Atlantic 
showed a very strong precession-driven cycle, with little 41,000 power.  One doesn' t need an 
FFT to see this signal!  This site and som e other regions show st rong and obvious orbital 
signals.  
 
  
D. That the earth' s orbital parameters has some  influence on the earth' s climate is now widely 
accepted (with a small minority of holdouts).  The question that is more controversial is: how 
significant is the role of orbital parameters on climate change relative to other causes of 
climate change?  It is possible that other pr ocesses (internal drifts or resonances) are 
dominant, but that they simply  lock onto the "pacemaker of th e ice ages" (e.g., just as the 
energy for a heartbeat always comes from the body, not the pacemaker).  How can we 
investigate this problem?  Image removed due to copyright considerations.</text>

4. However, expressing the m ethod as in equati on IV.C.1 points the way to alternative ways 
of calculating the spectra in situations invol ving unevenly spaced data and/or tim e series 
with gaps. In those cases, one can convert the time series of IV.C.1. to a tim e series with

where t i is the tim e corresponding to each observation (t 1 is the first observation) and P is the 
time length of the series of observations (t N-t1).  
This format can result in a situ ation where there are more Four ier coefficients (which must 
remain as the harmonics of the time series re cord length) than observations. This situation 
can be dealt with by ignoring the highest ha rmonics (i.e., chopping off the right hand side 
of IV.C.4 as necessary). In fact, it is possi ble to ignore m ost of the higher harm onics 
entirely [which often m akes sense in paleoclim atic time series, where the error on the time 
scale renders the highest Fourier coefficients  meaningless), resulting in a situation where 
there are m ore observations than Fourie r coefficients. In this case, equation  IV.F.1.(a)???  
can be solved using a least squares approach: 
 
x = (ATA)-1 AT g 
 
 These m ethods aren' t as com putationally e fficient as the FFT, but given the power of 
modern com puters, the drain on com puting pow er is trivial when relatively few spectra 
are being calculated. 
 
5. The finite discretely sam pled tim e series F ourier transform  treats the data as though it were 
periodic, i.e. the m easured tim e series repeats itself over and over again.  This leads to 
some problem s: if first and last data points are quite different, the FT m ust use m any high-
frequency harm onics of the fundam ental freque ncy in order to create the sharp break.   
C. Nyquist folding frequency and aliasing: with a discrete sam pling frequency, it is not possible 
to observe frequencies that are higher than half that sam pling frequency. Even worse, the 
higher frequencies com e back at you as if they were signals of lower frequency ( aliasing ):  
 
 
This flaw can be avoided by using a filter to eliminate frequencies that are higher than the 
Nyquist frequency (such as sam pling at a very high rate and integrating the signal for the 
duration of the sam pling interval). Bioturbati on is actually helpful here - you won' t find 
daily cycles in oxic m arine sedim ent cores.  </text>

a. Amplitude  of cycle at frequency j is (a j2 + bj2)1/2 (i.e., the length of the vector in 
(sin,cos) space, or the complex conjugate (a+b i)(a-b i). [where i here is the imaginary 
number, square root of -1]   
b. By analogy, then, a j2 + bj2  = power at frequency f j (i.e., the (amplitude squared) of 
cycle j).  
c. The measurement units of power are amplitude 2/cycle per time unit.  
d. The logic behind using power  spectra for climate processes is debatable.  Power spectra 
arose in the field of electrical engineering, so  the choice is obvious in that context. It is 
not so obvious in the case of sea level; even  if you would want to know the change in 
gravitational potential energy due to changing sea level, it is not proportional to the 
square of the am plitude. In fact, it m ight often be m ore useful to present amplitude  
spectra, which can simply be related to the wiggles one sees in the data (e.g. meters 
change of sea level). Typically, this is not done, solely because of the electrical origin 
of spectral analysis; statistical packages usually derive spectral estim ates using 
programs written for electrical analysis. In any event, it is straightforward to take the 
square root of the power to get the am plitude.

trailing zeros.  In effect, you have doubled th e length of your tim e series without having 
added any data!  While this m ay worry you, it doesn' t bother the fourier transform  at all, 
which will still happily compute the spectra.  And it doesn' t work too badly: in a test case 
where two sine waves corresponding to adja cent frequency bands in an original tim e 
series had the resolution doubled this way, th e new FFT in fact was able to resolve the 
two sine frequencies.  However, in doing so, it also generated "side bands" with 
significant amplitudes.  So the extra resolu tion of these two bands was obtained at the 
expense of "contam inating" the rest of the spect rum.  So in a real time series with a few 
strong frequency peaks, this method will compromi se your ability to look at the rest of the 
spectrum.  Caveat FFTer ! 
 
7. Optimal Spectral Estimation.   
a. Tapering results in some loss of spectral power (m ost severe at low frequencies) and (in 
some cases) loss of resolution between frequency bands. But it also m inimizes 
"leakage", the tendency for spectral power to "leak" from  one frequency into the 
estimate for adjacent frequencies.

E. These changes in the earth's orbital elements  affect radiation received at the top of the 
atmosphere ("insolation") as a function of hemisphere, latitude, and time of year.  
1. Effect of precession/eccentricity:   
a. Inter-hemispheric radiation receipt: th e hemisphere whose summer occurs during 
perihelion receives more insolation than the other hemisphere). The higher the 
eccentricity, the stronger the contrast.  
b. Seasonal contrast within a hemisphere: as a hemisphere alternates between periods of 
summer perihelion and winter perihelion, the seasonal contrast in insolation is 
modified. The two hemispheres are out of phase with respect to this effect.  
2. Effect of obliquity: high-latitude summer insolation: high tilt leads to more radiation 
received at high latitudes during summer  (that comes at the expense of the mid- and low-
latitudes; high-latitude winters not affected by changes in tilt).  
F. These orbital characteristics can all be calculated accurately via Newtoni an mechanics into the 
distant past (many millions of years). Accumu lation of uncertainties (e.g. in relative masses 
of planets; shape and density distribution of plan ets) causes absolute values (i.e., which side 
of the sun is the earth on at some exact point in time in the future?) to be uncertain beyond 
several million years, although the frequencies  are probably known reasonably well beyond 
that time.  For the last million years, we may regard these calculations as virtually 
unquestionable.  
III. How do we make the comparison between these precisely calculable orbital changes and the 
record of climate change?   
A. Curve-matching is always popular.  But given subjectivity, the possibility of phase lags, and a 
rubber time scale, this approach has drawbacks.  
B. Objective methods: many are possible, but for cyclic  processes, Fourier analysis is a natural. It 
is nonetheless possible to be fool oneself w ith it's mathematical elegance, however; the 
statistics assume certain characteristics that might not apply to the data at hand.  
IV. FOURIER POWER SERIES ANALYSIS   
A. Prism analogy: look at component frequencies of  a time-variant process. Fourier showed that 
any reasonable function of time can be repr esented as a sum of sines &amp; cosines.  
B. Theorem: Let G(t) be any well-behaved (continuous; diffe rentiable; continuous derivatives) 
function.  If we sample this function discretely  in uniform time intervals (creating a series 
G(t1), G(t 2), ...G(t n), then there is one (and only one) complex function S(f) = A(f) + B(f) i 
[where s is frequency and i is the square root of -1] such that  
       G(t) = &#931; (aj sin f j + b j cos f j)   
         where fj =  j/t n for j = 1 ... n  
     These harmonics f j are orthogonal  (i.e. one cannot reconstruct f j wave as &#931;fk&#8800;j and complete  
(i.e. any "reasonable" signal in t can be fit perfectly &amp; uniquely).  </text>

3. Problem : Statistical significance of periodogram   
a. White noise:  equal energy (power) per frequency band &#8710;f (alm ost equivalent to random  
number series in time).  
b. Just as tossing a sm all num ber of coins is  unlikely to give precisely 50% heads and 
tails, a finite  time series is unlikely to have precisely equal energy per &#8710;f; in effect, 
"counting statistics" play a role; the longer the tim e series, the less the fluctuations 
within &#8710;f.  
c. Hence, a finite time series of a non-periodi c function will show peaks and valleys in the 
periodogram .  We would like to define criteri a so that we can assess the likelihood that 
a peak observed in a real tim e series is due purely to chance.  
d. There are a num ber of "rules" around wh ich purport to tell you "how m any cycles" you 
need to prove a periodic process; typically  these rules specify 5 or 10 cycles. While 
there is a grain of truth within these rules,  they can be misleading. Is a record with </text>

R.G. Johnson had proposed to use the orbita l cycles as the &#8220;tree rings&#8221; of m arine 
sedim ents, and use them  to establish a tim e scale independent of other constraints. This 
approach was dism issed by SPECMAP, but later, Shackleton et al. applied spe
analysis tuning techniques towards this techni que and proposed that the ages of sever
paleom agnetic boundaries were si gnificantly older than previously
780 kyrBP). Independent 39Ar/40Ar dating (Spell and McDougall, 1992; Baksi et al.,

(Baksi et al. 1992) indicates that this  reversal is closer to 780 kyrBP.]   
B. First widely accepted application was a 1976 pa per by Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton, in which 
spectral analysis was applied to a 450,000 year  record of (radiolarian Im brie-Kipp) T, &#948;18O, 
and the abundance of a particular radiolarian, C. davisiana .

1. They found that spectral analysis of all of these records produced sp ectral peaks near 100, 
41, and 23-19 kyr (i.e., sam e as eccen tricity, obliquity, and precession.  
2. The peaks appeared to be statistically signi ficant (uhm&#8230;, sort of: their statistical test, 
which is differs from that given above, ha s been criticized and never successfully 
defended...)  
3. This statistical coincidence earned the orbita l variations the title of "pacemaker of the ice 
ages".  
4. Because the time scale has relatively large un certainties in the region between termination I 
and the B-M m agnetic reversal, the phases of the cycles were not coherent with the orbital 
computations. By m aking num erous sm all adjust ments to the time scale, well within the 
uncertainties allowed geologically, it is po ssible to maintain a consistent phase 
relationship between the orbital indicators a nd the clim ate indicators for the last 450,000 
years.  
a. This finding gave rise to the concept of "tuned" tim e scales"  (e.g., SPECMAP time 
scale).  Basically, in the absence of radiom etric age control, the logic is:  
i. Within the errors of the geologic time s cale, and in particular during the intervals 
where age control is good, orbital param eters seem  to m aintain a consistent phase 
relationship with &#948;18O variations.  
ii. So, ASSUME that this phase relationshi p holds for tim es when the age control is 
not very good, and use pert urbations of the original tim e scale to bring the 
precession and obliquity cycles into  consistent phase relationships.  
iii. If we consider this technique only as a chronological tool subject to the eventual 
proof of the assum ptions, this m ethod is a reasonable m eans for interpolating tim e 
between known control points.  But SPECMAP then proposed to do som ething 
more dangerous: to use data on this ne w time scale to evaluate the orbital 
hypothesis!  This m ight seem  circular, and it is in part, but it isn' t com pletely, since </text>

K. El Nino in fossil 124 kyrBP Indonesian coral? &#8211; oxygen isotopes and Sr/Ca in a fossil 
coral that grew 124,000 years ago in Indones ia &#8220;reflect interannual variability in 
precipitation and sea surfac e temperature (SST) due to El Ni&#241;o/Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO).&#8221; 
 
 
II. Deep Sea Corals  
 
 Deep-sea corals grow for 50-200 years as so litary individuals attached to a hard surface 
(sometimes &#8220;mounds&#8221; of these occur growing on t op of each other). Optical density banding is 
observed and the number of bands is  approximately equal to the age of the coral (Cheng et al., 
2000; but it is uncertain whether these bands are always annual, and it is not clear how to 
sample the coral to bring out temporal si gnals apart from moving from the attachment end 
towards the growth edge. 
 Smith et al. (1997) pointed out that deep sea corals could be used to tackle paleo 
problems. Adkins et al. (1998) showed that 230Th/U, 14C, and Cd/Ca could be used to 
demonstrate decadal-scale changes in deep wa ter properties in the deep Atlantic.

5. Although Em iliani knew that m odern ice was relatively light and had an isotopic 
composition of about -25 &#8240;, he argued that the bulk of snowfall during the glacial 
maximum (where ice is accum ulating at lower latitudes) m ust have an isotopic 
composition of about -15 &#8240;, because this is the com position of precipitation at ~-5 to 
0&#176;C  (where the bulk of snowfall will occu r because of the exponential dependence 
of vapor pressure on tem perature).  From  then-current estimates of sea-level change 
(about 100m ) and the assum ption that ice sheets m ust have an isotopic com position 
of about -15 &#8240;, Em iliani calculated that the contribution of ice volum e change to 
changes in the isotopic com position of th e ocean corresponded to about 1/3 of the 
total change:  
   M o&#948;o + Mi&#948;i = constant  
   M o = 1.4 x 10 21 kg  
   A o = 361 x 10 6km2  
C. One m ajor problem  with Em iliani' s reasoni ng is that ice sheets don' t represent average 
snowfall; wastage of the sheet is highest near the southern m argin where snowfall is also 
the highest; glacial flow results in the bul k of the ice sheet representing the isotopic 
composition of the northern interior, with m uch m ore negative &#948;18O (-30 to -50 &#8240;).  Image removed due to copyright considerations.</text>

and estimated that seawater &#948;18O shifted by -1.0&#177;0.25 &#8240; since the last glacial 
maximum ; assuming a sea-level change of 120 m (most recent estimate) would 
imply that the isotopic composition of the latest Pleistocene ice sheet was about &#8211;
32 &#177; 8 &#8240;. Later, Adkins et al. (2002) extended this approach to paleosalinity 
estimation, which allows for estimation of sea level ch ange. Taken at face value, 
this data implies ~150 m fall in sea leve l at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), 
which is 20-30 m more than estimated from sea level observations.  
 
  
3. Thus, depending somewhat on the exact &#948;18O of the glacial ice sheets and the actual 
sea level change, it appears that about 2/3 of the glacial-interglacial &#948;18O difference 
would be due to ice volume (the reverse of Emiliani's estimate).

B. Shackleton's first paper compared mixed benthic species with surface planktonic 
species and found a 1:1 correlation.  So Shackleton argued that m ost ("at least 2/3
the planktoni") of

conclusion of 8-10&#176;C cooling.  As this idea came to be accepted, it was common to 
find "at least 2/3" converted to "m ore than 2/3" or even "m ost of the benthic isotopic 
change is due to ice volum e changes".   
1. Work over recent years indicates that the 2/3 num ber was probably just about on th
mark.  The argum ents require that you know  more about the physical evidence fo
paleo sea level [to be covered later] .  
2. Shackleton pointed out that if m ost of the oxygen isotope signal is due to ice volum e
18O records from  throughout the ocean are "globally synchronous" (within the ~100
year m ixing tim e of the ocean) and ca
relative chronology. He also establishe d several "sub-stages" to Em iliani' s 
stratigraphy that enhanced the corrrela tion precision of this stratigraphy. 
roecker and van Donk (1970) noted that in many data sets, deglaciations were oft
much more extreme than gl acial inceptions ("sawtooth" records) and introd
concept of "Terminations" which are the la rge abrupt deglaciations such a
transition out of the last glacial m aximum, which was dubbed "Term ination I".

value of the ratio at zero age is the production rate from  the 235U and 234U in 
seawater. We now know that this assu mption is incorrect: Th and Pa are 
fractionated by their differential pa rticle reactivity in the ocean. 
  
III. Oxygen isotope hydrology

change in the isotopic com position of seawater.

3. Similar fractionation occurs for hydrogen isotopes, except that since the m  ass 
 difference is proportionately larger, the is otope fractionation for D/H is larger (by  
about a factor of 8)  
4. Since most evaporation occurs in the tr opical and subtropical ocean (highest vapor 
pressures) and since most precipitation results from the transport of this tropical 
water vapor towards cooler polar regions , there is a strong correlation between 
average annual temperature and the average annual &#948;18O.

1. Em iliani developed an isotope stage num bering schem e, based on periods of warm er 
(odd) and colder (even) that he could recognize reliably in his records (sm aller 
changes were ignored).  
2. This work created quite a stir, a nd was quickly criticized on several grounds:  
a. It violated the prevailing 4-ice-ag e theory from  continental stratigraphy.  
b. Meteorologists though that the tropical temperature change seem ed excessive.  
c. Micropaleotologists found discrepancies between thei r initial m icropaleontological 
work ( G. menardii  stratigraphy) and the down-core O-18 record.  
d. Biologists (e.g. B&#233;) argued that foram iniferal ecological shifts m ay have altered 
the depth habitat of organism s (and hence tem peratures).  
e. The time scale (based on 230Th/ 231Pa) was criticized.  
f. Various statistical errors were pointed out.  
3. Despite all of this criticism , with 1996 hi ndsight we can say that Em iliani was right 
about m ost of these points, with the m ajor exception being the tim e scale and the 
amplitude of tropical cooling.

IV. Shackleton benthic foram &#948;18O.  
A. This same conclusion also was proposed  by N.J. Shackleton, who suggested that 
temperature change in the cold  deep ocean must have been small (some waters certainly 
could not have been colder than the freezing point), so that &#948;18O in benthic  foraminifera 
would represent mainly ice-volume changes.  Problem: benthic foraminifera are scarce 
(only a few percent of total foraminifera ), so in general one requires 100x the raw 
sample size to get enough benthic foraminifera.  Shackleton collaborated with workers 
who developed an improved mass spectrome ter that required 10x less sample, which 
made benthic foram analysis practicable.

1. This was pointed out by Dansgaard (1968), who made measurements of &#948;18O in the 
Camp Century ice core in northwestern Greenland, finding typical values of -28 &#8240; 
near the surface and typical values of -40 &#8240; in the glacial maximum.   
2. It might seem that the isotopic com position of the Laurentide and Fennoscandian 
glacial ice is forever unknowable (because th e ice is gone).  However two ingenious 
ways of establishing isotopic composition of glacial ice have been suggested:   
a.  Hillaire-Marcel and Causse (1989) investigated the isotopic composition of 
carbonates precipitated from sub-glacial str eams.  The temperature is constrained 
to a narrow range (melting point as a f unction of pressure); modern analogues 
suggest that a range of -1.5 to 5 &#176;C is reasonable.  If the carbonates are at 
equilibrium, we can calculate the isotopic composition of the meltwater to better 
than 1 &#8240;.  These results suggest that ice near the southern margins of ice 
Laurentide ice sheet was about -16 to -19 &#8240;, and that of the interior of the ice 
sheet about -30 &#8240;.  In view of the likely flow lines, this result support the notion 
that the bulk of the ice sheet had an  isotopic composition closer to -30 &#8240; than to -
15&#8240;.  
b. As pointed out by McDuff (1984), the delay in diffusion of salt and isotopes into 
the pore waters of oceanic sediments should lead to a maximum of salinity and a 
minimum in &#948;18O near 40 m depth, because of the time scale of diffusion:  
     t~ __
x2  /D ~ (16 x106 cm 2) / (2 x10-6 cm 2/sec)  ~ 250,000 years    
    So pore waters at that depth are closer to the average salinity and &#948;__18  O over the 
past several glacial cycles  rather than to the current oceanic values which are less 
salty and isotopically lighter.  Schrag a nd DePaolo (1993) applied this technique Vertical cross section of an ice sheet resting on a horizontal subsurface. Ice particles deposited on the snow
surface will follow lines that travel closer to the base the farther inland the site deposition. An ice mass formed around the divide (I-I) will be plastically deformed (thinned) with depth as suggested by the lined areas. Thedashed curve along the vertical ice core (C-C) shows the calculated horizontal velocity profile V
x (Weertman 
1968b). The horizontal arrows along C-C show the adopted approximation to V x (Dansgaard et al. 1969).xy

C. One of the first complications for thes e arguments was the observation that the oxygen 
isotope composition of shells of benthic foraminifera can differ from one another by 
substantial amounts.  J.C. Duplessy et al. (1970) found that many species of benthic 
foraminifera have differences of up to 0.7 &#8240; from one another.  This weakened 
Shackleton's conclusion somewhat, and required further work on single-species 
benthics.

D. Shackleton showed that Uvigerina  spp. appears to be in equilibrium (compared to the 
1970 O'Niel inorganic equation), and fo cused on developing benthic isotope 
stratigraphies based on this species.  The c onclusions remained much the same as his 
previous work, and people (other than an angry Emiliani) began to view benthic &#948;18O 
records as proxy sea-level records.  For a period in the 1970's (and unfortunately, even 
today&#8230;), it was common for people to label benthic &#948;18O records as "ice volume", 
virtually neglecting any possible role fo r deep ocean temperature variations.  
E. The argument against Emiliani's tropical  paleotemperature interpretation was 
strengthened by John Imbrie's paleo-ecol ogical temperature method, which also 
indicated that that tropical sea surface temperatures had not changed much.  This method 
needs to be covered in some detail before we proceed.

Oxygen-isotope paleothermometry
 
I. 1940's: Kullenberg's invention of the pist on core. Previously, deep-sea coring was done by 
gravity coring, where a pipe with an in-lin e stopper at the top and "core catcher" at the 
bottom (interleaved flexible metal fingers) wa s dropped into the seafloor. Friction against 
the walls of the pipe limited the length of core that could be obtained. Modern gravity cores 
can get cores ~ 5 m in length; older ones obtained only a meter or two. Kullenberg 
introduced a piston into the pipe; the piston wa s rigged with a cable that prevented it from 
moving down with the pipe, creating "suction" which helped force the sediment into the 
pipe as it moved down into the sediment. Modern piston cores can obtain as much as ~50 m 
of sediment (although more typically, ~20 m). 
 
II. 1950's: Emiliani  
A. Using Urey's mass spectrometer, which required about 5 mg of calcium carbonate (about 
100-200 individuals of foraminifera), Emiliani analyzed a variety of species of 
planktonic foraminifera from the Caribbean and found an apparent depth stratification , 
with some species ( G. sacculifer , G. ruber ) recording isotopic temperatures close to that 
of surface seawater; others recording colder temperatures.  
B. Emiliani analyzed downcore records of  apparent surface dwellers throughout the 
Atlantic; making a correction for changes in the isotopic composition of seawater (more 
about this later), he calculated a 6-8 &#176; decrease in tropical o cean surface temperatures 
during glacial periods (i.e. about 1.5 &#8240; &#948;18O increase).  He found evidence for many  
glacial/interglacial cycles over the last half  million years; he coined the isotope stage 
stratigraphy system (now commonly referred to  as "MIS" (Marine Isotope Stage); and 
he argued that the data supported the M ilankovitch mechanism of climate change.  </text>

LIFESTYLES OF THE SMALL AND CALCAREOUS  
 
Studies of &#948;18O and foraminifera in the modern o cean: plankton tow, sediment trap, and 
culture studies as a tracer of planktonic foram behavior 
 
I . Motivation 
A. Certain groupings of foraminifera show pl ausible correlations with surface ocean T.  
These correlations can be used to estimat e surface T from counts of core-top forams: 
"faunal index".  
B. However, various planktonic  species appear to grow at different depths, water masses, 
and/or different seasons. This knowledge, in view of the "correlation, not causation" 
aspect of paleoecological temperatures, leads us to accep t the "faunal index" with 
some caution.  We would like to know more about the likely stability of assemblages 
with time, and whether dissolution-driven changes in the sedimentary assemblages: 
e.g., G. ruber  is dissolution-susceptible; N. dutertrei  is somewhat dissolution-
resistant.  But in transfer functions, G. ruber  contributes to warm temperatures while 
N. dutertrei  contributes to moderate temperatures).  
C. Oxygen isotope studies can shed some light on the ecology of foraminifera.  Early 
studies used fossils from sediments, but these studies have some inherent ambiguities: 
e.g., are the sedimentary foraminifera (ave rage of dissolution-weighted flux over the 
last 500-2000 years) representative of the o cean of the last 50 years?; problem of 
seasonal progression information being lost by mixing; '100 year event' problem.  These studies also pointed out that different sizes of foraminifera of the same species 
may have significantly different isotopic compositions.  The first studies of plankton tow foraminifera gave signs of the problem: Shackleton et al. found that different 
species collected in the same plankton tows had significantly different &#948;
18O.  This 
difference could arise either from "vital e ffects" or from vertical migration of 
foraminifera.

C. Recent evidence by J. Erez indicates that foraminiferal calcification proceeds in two 
steps by two different mechanisms:   
1. The foraminifera set down an organic temp late that is genetically determined to 
create the distinctive structure and form of the species. A thin layer of high-Mg 
calcite is set down upon that template by transporting birefringent membrane-
encapsulated Ca-Mg-P bodies to the site of calcification and lysing the membranes 
to produce a pulse of extreme carbonate s upersaturation that precipitates a high-
Mg calcite layer.  
2. After this initial calcification, the fora minifera transport vacuoles of modified 
seawater to the sites of calcification. Th ese vacuoles originate when foraminifera 
use their cell membrane to "surround" s eawater into vacuoles that are drawn 
within the cell membrane. These vacuoles ar e then chemically m odified to remove 
Mg and increase the pH (H + exchange for Mg ++?). They are transported to the site 
of calcification where low-Mg calcite  is precipitated (note: in normal 
supersaturated normal seawater, calc ite is not precipitated because Mg ++ inhibits 
its nucleation. Hence the removal of Mg ++...).  
3. Given that most of the calcification pro ceeds from seawater that  has been modified 
only slightly, it is reasonable to expect th at shell chemistry will be related to the 
seawater chemistry.  
VIII.  What controls relative  species abundance variations in sediments, and why do the 
assemblages correlate with surface T in th e modern ocean?  Are there circumstances 
when they might not?  
A. Two Ideas:  
1.Individual foram species 'float' at a given density level (buoyancy control).  
2. Individual foram species have an optimum growth T.  
3. Of course, these two factors are corre lated since T is the dominant control on 
density in the modern ocean.  
B. (T or density) preferences combine with availability of food at the optimum (T or 
density) (or, in the case of those species with  symbiotic algae, with the availability of 
light) to control the rate of  reproduction and calcification. </text>

F. All of which (of course) will be a func tion of the physical regim e (region, season).  
G. The above produce the annual flux of foram inifera to the seafloor (com plicated by the 
100-year events); this flux is then m odified by selective dissolution and 
fragmentation on the seafloor to produce surface sediments. (e.g. H. pelagica  is a 
common foram  in tows but it is hardly ever  observed in sedim ents). This process m ay 
favor the retention of specim ens which liv ed in environm ental conditions favoring 
more robust tests, and thus produce a sedim entary O-18 record that differs from  the 
annual sedim ent trap flux.  
H. This concept seem s fine, but no one has successfully synthesized this m odel (or 
variants of it) to reproduce the results obser ved in plankton tows, sedim ent traps, and 
core-top sedim ents.  Som e people who have tried say it can' t be done! Is the problem  
insufficient inform ation (e.g. not enough spa tial coverage, poor indicators of what the 
food source is really like [chl. m ax may not really be the productivity m ax.], etc.) or 
is it due to a deficiency of the conceptual model?

Note: the conclusion about carbon isotopes only applies in this area. In other areas, 
there are strong &#948;13C vertical gradients and we exp ect that deep calcification will 
influence &#948;13C.  
V II. Calcification: do foraminifera really care about equilibrium ? 
A. Most paleo work assum es that foram iniferal calcite is in isotopic equilibrium  with the 
seawater in their immediate environment. But is this really true? Foram iniferal 
calcification proceeds rapidly (minutes to a day) but then we want that calcite to 
remain out of equilibrium  with the bottom  waters for tens of m illions of years - can 
we be sure that foram iniferal calcite rea lly form s at equilibrium ? In som e cases, we 
can say that som e foram inifera definitely  do NOT: species that register "isotopic 
temperatures" that are warmer  than anything in the water colum n; coexisting benthic 
foram inifera that have different isotopic compositions (hence at least one of which 
must be out of equilibrium ). But in other cases it is m ore difficult to be certain.  
B. We have to rem ember that foram iniferal calcite is the "home, sweet home" of these 
organism s, constructed deliberatel y and precisely by highly evolved 
genetic/m olecular m echanism s. Given m otivation to do so, foram inifera m ay 
manipulate the geochem istry of their shells to suit their circum stances.  </text>

2. Other tim es, foram s appear to be out of equilibrium  (in both directions)...Possible 
explanations include vertical m igration,  temperature changes since calcification 
(e.g. beginning or ending of upwelling events; eddy m ixing), disequilibrium  
calcification, GOKW.  Also: it is often noted  that sediment core top forams often 
register colder temperatur es com pared to those taken from  plankton tows or 
sedim ent traps.  Is this difference due to  selective dissolution of "warm " calcite (or 
individuals that grew in warm  water) or ' gametogenic calcification'  occurring 
deeper in the water column?.

2. Vertical stratification of abundance: G. ruber , G.sacculifer  are m ost abundant near 
the surface (due to sym biotic photosynthe sizing algae?); m ost other species are 
most abundant at the subsurface productivity  maximum; a few species appear to 
live at greater depth (e.g. G. theyeri ).  
3. Som e species are found alive at depth, but their shell &#948;18O implies that they cease 
to calcify below a certain depth.  
4. What is the mechanism of vertical species stratification of foraminifera?  
Temperature or density preference? Food?   
5. Difference between flux and standing crop?

IX.  These data and ideas have implicati ons for micropaleontological faunal T indices.  
There seems some hope that on the average  they are OK - but also suggests that there are 
situations where they might be misleading. (esp. regions where the mixed layer is thin 
(e.g. equatorial ocean), or where there are large seasonal variations)  
X. There also is some eviden ce that some organisms may be better delimiters of water 
masses (both surface and shallow subsurface) than surface temperature or some other 
single enviromental property.

D. Other species consistently show 'cold' &#948;18O (e.g. G. truncatulinoides  appears to live 
deeper in the water column during summer, shallower during winter.  Given the large 
variations in the total flux, the annual wei ghted average will be recording the winter 
T.   
E. Some species appear only in a specific season, (e.g. N. dutertrei  appeared to track 
surface T in spring; G. conglobatus  registers surface T in winter).  
F. Some species just appear to be odd! (e.g. G. bulloides).   
G. Despite its obvious offset from equilibrium, G. bulloides  records the annual surface 
temperature cycle quite well.  G. truncatulinoides , however, shows a seasonal cycle 
that is more similar to that seen at 1000m! 
 
 
 
H. Conclusions: ' &#948;18O stratification' in foram samples from core tops represents 
differences in depth habitat and seasonal variations in T and species flux. By 
inference, we can also expect that inte r-annual, -decadal, and &#8211;centennial variability 
can matter.

B. Flux of some species varies with season (e.g. G. truncatulinoides  has high flux in 
winter, low flux in sum mer (factor of 100); there also appear to be ' phenotypic'  
variations (i.e. changes in the appearan ce of the shells of a given species).

this is converted to DMS [(CH 3)2S] when they are munched up. 
 
2. DMS is volatile and goes into the atmosphere 
 
3. DMS is oxidized in the atmosphere to two byproducts with a "branch ratio": sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA: CH 3SO3H).  Cycle is complex with many 
intermediates; branch ratio appears to depend mainly on temperature (low MSA:nssSO 4= 
at warmer temperatures) 
 
4. The products are transported to the ice and recorded there as non-sea-salt sulfate (nss 
SO4=) and MSA. </text>

c. 10Be provides one or two absolute spikes that can test the accuracy the chronology 
provided by the above methods, and perhaps allow for a quicker homing in. If, as now 
seems very likely, the 10Be spikes are linked to fluctuati ons in the earth's magnetic field, 
it may also allow a link to chronologies in marine sediments and continental materials.  
d. correlation to other highly re solved climate records (e.g. ice &#948; 18O compared to gray scale 
of Cariaco Trench varved sediments, biot urbation index of S anta Barbara Nasin 
sediments) is useful, but carries inherent uncertainty regarding the phase relationships 
(some events may lead, others may lag, even though linked to the same system. For 
example: maximum summer warmth lags maximum incoming radiation by several 
months...)  
e. Volcanic ash: Ram and Gayley (1991) obs erved a volcanic ash shard layer 1950 m 
depth in the Dye 3 ice core which they s uggested was the same as a marine ash layer 
observed by Ruddiman and Glover (1972) - hence linking the marine and ice core 
chronologies at ~57 kyrBP.  
f. Acidity links Indonesian marine record to ce ntral Greenland ice core? (can we be sure

against the gradient established by gravity.

B. The state of the art, 1998  
1. Absolute chronology  
a. Ice core layer counting at  GISP2 appears to be the winner for precision and accuracy for 
the past ~40,000 years. It is consistent with &#948;18O2 but offers more precision. Beyond 
that period, it becomes increasin gly less objective and inaccurate.  
i. a possible competitor in this interval is the calibrated radiocarbon record linked to key 
climate events. The accuracy ultimately should be the same or better, but problems 
in sorting out atmospheric D14C variabilit y and phase leads and lags make it more 
problematical.  
b. &#948;18O2 links us to the marine chronology prior to that time (the marine  chronology being 
constrained by coral 230Th/U dates correlated to foraminiferal d18O  and "orbital tuning"  
2. Relative chronologies  
a. &#948;18O2 links ice cores between the two hemisphere with a relative precision of a few 
hundred to several thousands of years.  
b. detailed CH 4 records can correlate ice cores between the hemisperes to several 
decades to several hundredds of years, given sufficient temporal resolution of the core 
and sampling.  </text>

 In recent years, several groups have tried to devised new &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; paleotemperature 
equations based on inorganic precipitation in th e laboratory (e.g. Kim and O'Neil (1997), core top 
calibrations (e.g. Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1999, Matsumoto and Lynch-Stieglitz, 1999; and Grossman and 
Ku, 1986 for aragonite) or experimental manipulations  of foraminifera (e.g. Bemis et al., 1998). Often, 
these studies suggest that their new equation is the &#8220;true equilibrium paleotemperature equation&#8221; or that some species are closer to equilibrium than others. Despite acknowledging the value of the experiments (see below), I believe that claims concerning the &#8220;true&#8221; equilibrium relationship are unsupportable. Consider the following truisms: 
 
&#8226; Different species of foraminifera living in the same environment have different &#948;18O values. At 
least some of them are NOT in equilibrium. 
&#8226; We expect foraminifera to retain their oxygen isotope composition for (millions-tens of millions-
100&#8217;s of millions?) of years. If they manage to do this, then the rate of re-equilibration with their 
environments must be vanishingly small on the time scale of human laboratory experiments. 
&#8226; Inorganic precipitates may form out of equilibrium under certain conditions &#8211; but how can we 
know which conditions are &#8220;equilibrium&#8221;? It is a tenet of physical chemistry that we can only 
prove equilibrum exists when we have shown that the same value is obtained when approaching equilibrium from above and below. If carbonates take millions (or tens of millions) of years to 
re-equilibrate with solutions, no laboratory experiment can approach equilibrium from both 
irections. Hence we cannot know the true equilibrium value for carbonate isotopic composition. 
d 
In my estimation, the search for the &#8220;true paleotemperature equation&#8221; is akin to the search for the 
Holy Grail. It is better suited for Monty Python than for paleoceanographers.  
 
 In the absence of knowing true equilibrium, the best approach is a &#8220;modified empirical 
approach&#8221;:   
 (1) Use calibrations appropriate for the species in question (because we know that biological 
ractionations are possible. f 
 (2) Use calibrations that most closely approximate natural conditions (because the biological 
ractionations may depend on environmental conditions). f 
 (3) This situation may be seen as a curse upon proving equilibration, but it is necessary if 
environmental carbonates are to be used as paleotemperature recorders over tens of millions of 
ears. y

          <text>C. Practical measurement.  
1. It is difficult to avoid mass fractionation within the instrument, so rather than attempt to 
measure absolute ratios, we measure isotope ratio differences  between standards and samples 
(compared alternately in the instrument by switching a valve at the inlet): 
 
(10)  &#948;18O=1000Rsample
Rstandard&#8722;1&#9121; 
&#9123; &#9122; &#9124; 
&#9126; &#9125;  
 
      (units: &#8240; (permil)  
2. Measurements are made on CO 2 gas:  
atomic mass unit (amu): 44: 12C16O2 
 
      4 5 :  13C16O2, (12C16O17O) 
 
     4 6 :  12C16O18O   
 typical mass abundances:   
   16O = 99.759%     12C = 98.89% 
   17O =  0.037%      13C =  1.11% 
   18O =  0.204%  
 So for every measurement of &#948;13C, a small correction must be made for 17O (estimated from 
&#948;18O). As a generality, isotope fractionation for 2-mass-unit difference is usually  twice that 
for a 1-mass-unit difference. [Warning : some unusual processes violate this rule! For 
example, the process that produces ozone in the stratosphere has mass-independent 
fractionation- so the isotopic composition of ozone (and the residual oxygen in the atmosphere) is anomalous]. 
 
3. Other than for pure CO 2 gas, a procedure must be devised for conversion or isotopic 
equilibration with CO 2 gas. This requirement is at the root of many problems with the 
measurement - additional fractionations are introduced during the conversion process.

In theory (but in practice, not so easily; gases are not too bad, solids are possible, liquids are 
hard&#8230;), the equilibrium  constant can be derived f rom the statistical m echanics of  quantum

S tatistical mechanics: 
Assum es that all states which conserve total (quantized) energy are equally probable. For 
exam ple, suppose there are 5 particles with a tota l energy of five units (with a range of zero to 
five quantized at 1). One possible state is for all fi ve particles to have 1 unit of energy; another is 
for one particle (but which one? ) to have all of the energy; these alternatives are considered 
equally probable.

 As a generalization, we expect less isotopic fractionation at high tem peratures, because 
differences between the occupancy of isotope energy levels becom es smaller (but note that this 
decrease depends on the specific m olecules/phase s involved; significant isotope fractionation 
exists for silicate phases at very high tem peratures).

phosphate exchange extremely slowly, and because H 3PO4 has a low vapor pressure). 
Potential problems: CO 2 and H 2O left over from previous reactions can affect current 
reaction; problem may be minimized by using fresh aliquot of acid each time or by 
minimizing the volume of the reaction bath, and heating acid in vacuo to drive off water.  
The resulting CO 2 is then distilled by a freezing/warming cycle to free it of water and other 
volatiles. Many workers "roast" samples in vacuo  or in helium to "drive off organics" that 
might interfere; documentation on this practice is sparse and it may lead to problems (e.g. 
phase changes).  
b. Water: a known quantity of gaseous CO 2 of known isotopic composition is equilibrated with a 
larger quantity of water.  
Procedural precision should be better than 0.1 &#8240;.  Modern mass spectrometers can usually reproduce measurements on standards to better than 0.05 &#8240;. 
 
4. Standards.  An ideal standard is perfectly stable and available in perpetuity to anyone who 
wants it.  Real standards:  
a. PDB: a calcium carbonate powder prepared from the PeeDee Belemnite (a fossil from 
Georgia).  This was the standard reference for carbonate analysis of &#948;18O and &#948;13C for 
many years. Practically, one measures samples against PDB by measuring CO 2 evolved 
under controlled conditions:  
   3CaCO 3 + 2H 3PO4 -&gt; 3CO 2 + 3H 2O + Ca 3(PO 4)2 
  A problem: the water released in this reaction can react with the evolved CO 2 to 
change its isotopic composition. The extent of this back reaction depends critically on 
experimental conditions (temperature, mixing rate, previous samples analyzed...). Two experimental conditions are common: "common acid bath" (samples dumped into large bath in sequence) and "single drop" (drop of phosphoric acid placed on each sample). In principle, the latter should avoid memory problems better; in practice, it seems that either method works reasonably well in the hands of a careful analyst. 
 
  Another problem: PDB doesn't exist anymore! . As a result, people actually use 
other available standards which supposedly have been calibrated with respect to PDB (major ones: NBS-20, a 'dirty' limestone powder, and NBS-19, a coarse marble sand). Personal preferences, less than full competence, and personality differences between labs results in some confusion over interlaboratory comparisons. These problems seem to be 
worse for &#948;
18O than for &#948;13C, where differences of several tenths permil appear to occur 
at times. This is partly due to the greater scarcity of 18O compared to 13C, partly due to 
the &#8220;sticky&#8221; nature of H 2O (which can coat mass spectrometer surfaces), and partly due 
to small leaks in the vacuum system.  
b. SMOW: "Standard Mean Ocean Water", an artificial standard which approximates the 
oceanic mean, formerly maintained and recreated by Harmon Craig's laboratory, which 
refers to the isotopic composition of CO 2 equilibrated with SMOW, not  to the actual 
isotopic composition of the water; this doesn&#8217;t matter for measurements relative to 
SMOW but confuses many people when comparing absolute fractionations and 
converting to PDB. Problem: An infinite quantity of SMOW wasn't made; several batches of it have been used up.  Supposedly these batches have been carefully intercalibrated over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, more recent measurements (GEOSECS) of deep ocean water appear to be 0.2 permil offset with respect to the classic 
"Craig and Gordon" reference, suggesting that the standard has drifted over time!

OXYGEN ISOTOPE PALEOCLIMATOLOGY  
 I. Urey (1947) Thermodynamic properties of isotopes; statistical dynamical equations and infra-red  spectroscopy.  
 Because of the differences in the energy levels of the isotopes, isotope fractionation between 
equilibrium species is a function of temperature.  
 
The vibration frequency of two objects connected by a spring depends on their masses (and the &#8220;spring constant&#8221;). Similarly, the rotation characteristics and translational movements depend on mass. These factors are the fundamental causes of isotopic fraction. 
 
Ground-state energies: 
 Ground-state differences lead to kinetic  differences between isotopes (lower activation energies for 
lighter isotopes); differences in the energy-levels between the isotopes lead to changes in equilibrium distributions (rough
 rule of thumb: the heavier isotope "prefers" the more immobile 
state; i.e. at equilibrium water vapor is ~0.9% lighter than water).

Note: To use these all of these paleotemperature equations,  the isotopic composition of the water must be 
known! &#948; w must be referenced to the PDB scale if &#948;c is!  Note that if "the CO 2 equilibrated with SMOW" has a &#948;w 
which is 0.2 &#8240; heavier than &#948;w referred to PDB; i.e. : 
    &#948;w (PDB)  =  &#948;w (SMOW) - 0.2 
Also note that the actual  absolute isotopic composition of water is 30 &#8240; depleted compared to the absolute isotopic 
composition of the CO 2 it is equilibrated with!  
 
 These equations are empirical curve fits to data, and their functionality is not specified by theory. 
Ultimately, we can't prove that any of these relationships describe isotope equilibrium, because the carbonate is precipitated rapidly and does not re-equilibrate with the surrounding water after precipitation.

B. Some hard water lakes precipitate CaCO 3 that accumulates in sediments. Isotopic 
composition is a function of changes in the wa ter (mean temperature of precipitation) and 
local temperature.  
C. Devil's Hole vein calcite controversy. Wi nograd et al. (1985) and Ludwig et al. (1992) 
analyzed calcite deposited in a narro w groundwater vein in Nevada for &#948;18O and Th/U 
age. They reported that the deposit grew  from ~566 to ~60 kyrBP, and that the &#948;18O of 
this record indicated less depleted values at  140 kyrBP. They suggested that this record 
contradicted the SPECMAP chronology.   
1. Several people questioned the reliability of their chronology (e.g., how could they be 
sure that the initial 230Th was negligible when the youngest sample had significant 
230Th?). More recently, Edwa rds et al. (1997) used 231Pa/235U dating to check the 
ages of two Devil's Hole samples and f ound that the age was concordant with the 
230Th age - making it likely that the chronol ogy is accurate. On the other hand, the 
meaning of the &#948;18O record (knowing that groundwater can often be 20-40 kyr old) is 
not entirely straightforward. But recently Herbert et al. (2002) have used alkenone 
temperature estimates to show  that there appears to be a significant phase offset for 
the temperatures of the southwes tern US relative to the marine &#948;18O record, with 
warming occurring well before deglaciation.  This evidence suggests that the two 
records are showing a regional response to c limate change that differs from the global 
mean.  
 
 
IX. Continental chronology is a probl em once we are past the useful 14C time span.  Other 
dating techniques: therm oluminescence; speleothems can be 230Th dated (although the 
ssumption that initial 230Th is zero is at least somewhat questionable) a

Continental evidence for glacial climate change  
 
I. Introduction: In general, pale oclim atology is tougher on the continents than in the ocean.  It is 
hard to find continuous accum ulation sequences; in particular, near and under the northern 
ice sheets, the clim ate record is self-erasing.  Also, the paleo-ecology is m ore problem atical; 
does land vegetation respond sim ply to tem perature and rainfall (or both or extrem es of 
both)?  There are fewer good geochem ical indicat ors as well. The m ost successful techniques 
have involved lakes sedim ents and peat bog s ections. A few new m ethods have em erged in 
he past few years, however. t 
II. Studies of m oraines, stria tions, eskers, etc. (sometimes 14C dated) to infer ice sheet 
ovem ents, coverage at m axima and subsequent retreat pattern. m 
700-1000 m  snowline depression in Hawaii, Ne w Guinea, Colum bia, and East Africa; 
Andean and Him alayan ice caps.  Models suggest that this would require a 4&#176;C 
decline in tropical air temperat ures during peak glacial times. 
 
 
III. For the last 8,000 years, tree rings can help infer clim ate, either from  width variations and 
O,C,H isotopes in the cellulose; 14C variations also provide useful inform ation. However, 
there are significant m ethodological questions a bout the m eaning of stable isotopes in tree 
rings (are they affected by age of tree? do th ey record surface water or ground water? What 
s the effect of evapotranspiration on D and O in trees?...) i 
IV. Som e other bizarre paleoclim ate indicators: p ackrat middens (e.g. what type of seeds were 
available? What is the &#948;13C of those seeds? Not to m ention the &#948;13C of packrat urine..., 
eetle remains, ....) b

XI. Noble gas solubilities in relic groundwaters  
A. Basic idea is exquisitely sim ple: the diffe rent noble gases have different tem perature 
dependence for their aqueous solubilities:  
 
 
     If we have data on the equilibrium  cont ent of any two noble gases, the tem perature is 
defined. Having m ultiple noble gases,  the system  is over-determ ined.  
B. Complications: (1) 4He is added from radioactive decay - and this addition can't be 
inferred from  first principles; (2) in addition to equilibrium  solubility, som e atmospheric 
bubbles are trapped and dissolved at higher pre ssures. The gas content of this com ponent 
reflects the inter-gas ratio of the atm osphere, not the solubility. This problem  is 
significant, but it can be corrected for give n data on several noble gases: e.g., by finding 
out which m ixture of solubility equilibrium  and air dissolution m atches the data  the best 
for Ne-Xe. The residual anomaly for He is ta ken as a measure of the radioactive decay 
contribution.

VIII. Lake carbonates, speleothem s and vein calcites   
A. Speleothem s (stalactites and stalagm ites) are carbonate deposits produced when 
groundwater drips from  the roofs of caves and release CO 2 - thereby supersaturating in 
calcium  carbonate and precipitating successive  solid layers. Because groundwater is high 
in U, these deposits can be dated by U/Th m ethods (although one has to be careful about 
initial 230Th). Carbon and oxygen isotope m easurem ents are straightforward, although 
&#948;18O is influenced by changes in both T and groundwater &#948;18O.

D. Dispersion will cause some smoothing of the clim ate signal in the aquifer - can't expect to

E. Some results: 
1. Great Hungarian Plain 
2. Texas 
3. New Mexico 
4. Brazil coastal site - also 5 degC (i nvolves double correction -air plus heavy) 
5. South Africa - 5.5 
6. South Australia - 4 
7. Two sites in Europe (nearer to the ice sheet) show larger temperature drops.  
F. A recent multivariate approach to the data  (Ballentine and Hall, 1999) suggests that the 
errors in the noble gas paleotemperature may be larger than stated by Stute et al., and that 
the Brazilian data in particular should be regarded with caution.  
XII. In summary, continental evidence from low- latitude sites (mostly from higher elevations, 
however) favors a cooler, dryer climate during the last glacial maximum.  But is this consistent with the CLIMAP sea surface temp erature reconstructions and the oxygen isotope 
vidence? 
e 
A. Rind and Peteet (1985) showed that a particular GCM (Global Circulation Model) for the 
atmosphere could not reconcile CLIMAP with  the continental evidence.  In order to 
produce a cooler, dryer low-latitude continental climate, they had to cool tropical surface 
temperatures by 4&#176;C in order to match the model climate with the continental 
observations.  
B. Broecker (1986) argues that the oxygen is otope evidence favors CLIMAP, with some 
possible uncertainties.  
C. Is this discrepancy due to problems with one or both data sets, or is it a problem with the 
climate model? More recent evaluations, us ing alternative marine  paleotemperature 
methods (alkenones, Mg/Ca) and revised foraminiferal transfer functions suggest that the 
tropics cooled a bit, but by not as much as  the continents. However, Bard (1999) points 
out that in computer GCM c limate models, the continents are cooler than the ocean - 
partly because of the 130 m sea level drop (h ence continents are 130 m higher relative to 
sea level than today) and also because con tinental interiors are colder than marine-
influenced boundaries.

A. "eolian diatoms"

C. wind-blown detrital sediments

tolerances but rather their whiteness which aids  their survival in the arctic.  While it m ay 
be safe to assum e that polar bears will not th rive naturally in warm  clim ates, you have to 
be careful inferring temperature from their distri bution.  It is reasonable to expect that 
other factors are im portant to the distributions of organism s: light and nutrients (floral 
species); food availability and preferences (fauna l species); ecological interactions (both).  
C. Ocean paleochemistry: &#948;13C; Cd/Ca, Ba/Ca (tell us som ething about the distribution of 
nutrients and alkalinity in the ocean); carbonate dissolution indicators tell us about 
carbonate saturation in the deep ocean.  Problem : reliability of tracers under certain 
conditions.  
D. Terrigenous sedim ent sources: types of m inerals; grain size;  windblown m aterials vs. 
physical transport (water and turbidity currents); erosion.  
E. Geological Tim e Scale: how do we determ ine time in geological system s? Most often, our 
direct inform ation is spatial position: depth in  ice or sediment core, etc.. Sometimes we 
have radioactive tracer information - e.g. 14C, 230Th/U - but these may need calibration 
or have accuracy problems. Most often, we determine time indirectly, via cross 
correlation. As the prim ary inform ation on true  time expands, the ages of our sam ples is 
altered as if it were written on a rubber band.  
II. The "shifting paleotracer sand" problem: Paleo i ndicators rarely prove to be as simple as they 
are initially assum ed to be, and som etimes their interpretation changes radically. In part, this 
arises from the indirect nature of the estim ated properties relativ e to measured properties; in 
part, it arises out of the lim ited knowledge availa ble at the tim e that a tracer is introduced. A 
certain m easure of historical perspective is  needed to understand the lim its and capabilities 
of paleo tracers.  
III. "50 Year Event" problem . 
 
IV. Typical oceanic sedimentation pattern: 
 
 
The study of paleoclim atology in deep sea cores requires stable indicators of past conditions 
and a reliable tim e scale.  Carbonate fossils, esp.  Foram inifera, provide m ost inform ation - and 
are not found in deeper waters.  This is a special case of a m ore general problem : the 
"paleoceanographic uncertainty principle": no record is left of som e events.

PALEOCEANOGRAPHY     12.740     SPRING 2004       Lecture 1 
 
MAJOR PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC AND PALEOCLIMATIC EVENTS 
OF THE PAST 2 MILLION YEARS  
 
 Although evidence for past climate is found on land as well, the longest relatively 
complete record of climate change is containe d in deep-sea sediment cores. Although ice cores 
are short in duration and limited in geographic c overage, they are unparalleled in detail and in 
their ability to reconstruct past atmospheric composition. With sub-annual resolution, surface 
reef-building corals contain detailed informati on about tropical paleoclimate on times scale of 
ecades to millennia.. d 
 Paleoceanography is a young science.  For example, if you had been a respectable 
ajoritarian' scientist of the y ear ____ you wouldn't have believed: 'm 
     1850  Massive glaciers once covered the northern continents 
     1900  The earth is older than 20-40 m.y. 
     1950  There have been more than 4 major advances and retreats 
       of massive continental glaciers in the last 2 m.y. 
      1965  Ice advances/retreats are p aced by variations in the earth's orbit. 
 Most of the seafloor is &lt;200 m.y. old; preci ous little is &gt;100 m.y.  This time scale sets the 
practical horizons of paleoceanography as most practitioners know it. Of course, oceans existed 
before then and some clues to them are pres erved in rocks on the continent - but this is 
geology" not paleoceanography; the tools and t echniques available are completely different. " 
 "Typical" oceanic sedimenta tion rates:  0.1 - 3 cm/10 3 yrs, so 500,000 years is 
represented by 0.5 m to 15 m (covered by piston cores); 100 my requires 100m - 3000m 
(covered by DSDP, especially hydraulic piston co ring). Bioturbation of upper 3-15 cm reduces 
the time resolution obtainable from these sediments and induces artifacts of timing, precision, 
and magnitude. 
 
PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC INDICATORS 
 
I. Although paleoceanographers would like to be ab le to specify temperature, salinity, nutrient 
content, p CO2, etc., we can only know these indir ectly through biological, chemical, and 
physical properties of sediments.  How can we go about reconstructing these properties?  
A. Physical paleotemperatures (e.g. oxygen isotopes) based on chemical/physical principles. 
Problems: assumption of equilibrium etc. may not be valid in low temperature and/or 
biological systems; isotopic composition of seawater must be known or assumed.  
B. Bio-ecological paleotemperatures (e.g. Imbrie-Kipp method) based on modern-day 
correlations between temperature and the dist ribution of organisms in the ocean and in 
sediments. Problems: Correlation is observe d, but causation is assumed but not proven 
(i.e. are population distributions really due to  temperature tolerances of organisms?).  
How reliable is this assumption?  Example: polar bears live quite well in the warm San 
Diego Zoo; the limit on their presence in temp erate zones reflects not their temperature </text>

    This equation decribes each of the very large number of samples for which a large 
number of species has been counted as the linear combination of a small number of a 
small number of assemblages. 
 
D. Then, to interpret paleo-data, it is assumed that the assemblages remain stable, so that 
we can then interpret downcore data as  linear combinations of those same 
assemblages:

many species and several factor analysis assemblages in that sample, and these 
may contain information on the separate seasons.  But it is not clear that a simple 
assemblage regression against winter or su mmer SST is a valid way to get at this 
information.  
3. It is certainly not reasonable to take the paleosalinity estimates seriously.  SST and 
SSS are too highly correlated, so if T is the dominant variable, then the regressions simply tend to give us the m odern T-S correlation.  The mean salinity 
of the ocean was 1 &#8240; higher during the last ice ice; did this have 
any effect on the 
species composition of warm tropical waters?  
a. However, it is not entirely unreasonable th at salinity variations play some role 
in the growth of foraminifera. For exampl e, few foraminifera grow in the most 
saline waters of the Red Sea (S&gt;40 &#8240;). Some species of foraminifera probably 
can't tolerate very low salinities.  So  there is probably some paleosalinity 
information when near the tolerance limits  of foraminifera. How do we use this 
information however, and what is its margin of error?  
V. One alternative to Imbrie-Kipp: Modern Analogue Technique (MAT)   
A. As suggested in section IV.D.l. above, in trying to assign a paleotemperature to a 
fossil assemblage from a sediment core, in effect we are trying to find a modern sample of approximately the same species composition and saying that the 
temperature above that modern site is the pa leotemperature of the ancient site at the 
time the fossil assemblage formed. MAT proposes to do this comparison explicitly; 
e.g. it takes the species composition of the fossil sample, and assigns the it the temperature associated with the most similar modern samples. 
 
1. There are many ways this might be done - how do we assess the level of similarity 
between two samples?  The form of MAT adopted for oceanic samples uses a 
simple and easy-to-understand method.  Consider the n-dimensional space 
represented by the percentage of each sp ecies as an independent dimension.  
Samples are considered the most similar when the the distance between them is 
the smallest .  So the paleotemperature estimat e adopted is the average of the 
temperatures of the core-top samples closes t to the paleo-sample in species space.  
2. One of the advantages of this approach  is that it provides a quantitative measure of 
the degree to which you are able to find a suitable analogue. You are always able 
to find the most similar modern samples,  and hence derive a paleotemperature 
estimate, but you also get a dissimilarity coefficient that can tip you off when the 
modern and ancient samples are really not all that similar.    
3.  Work by Bob Thunell in western tropical Pacific suggests that MAT works better 
than Imbrie-Kipp in samples that are re latively heavily dissolved.  MAT simply 
finds a modern heavily-dissolved an alogue sample, whereas Imbrie-Kipp 
struggles to keep the species assemblage groupings constant.

Since the equations are chosen to fit the da ta, they are OK for samples that lie within 
the range of the calibration samples.  Bu t for samples that lie outside of the 
calibration range, the equations ar e unconstrained and can blow up: the "no-
analogue" problem   
1. One of the solutions to this problem is to avoid using the technique for samples 
that fall outside the calibration range of factor compositions.  Unfortunately, this 
includes some interesting areas, and it also has a somewhat arbitrary nature: how 
does one assess exactly when the no-analogue problem arises?  
C. The method also has some problems with dissolution of calcium carbonate on the 
seafloor: some species of foraminifera ar e more sensitive to dissolution than others, 
so dissolution can alter the species com position and hence the factor composition.  
1. One way to miminize the problem is to include "dissolved" samples in the set of 
calibration samples.  This was done by Kipp (1976) in her Atlantic transfer 
function.  It does not work as well in the Pacific however, where the extent of 
dissolution is greater; much of the micropaleontological information has been lost.  
D. A more troublesome aspect of the regression procedure is the arbitrary nature of the 
calibration data (e.g., sea surface temperature,  SST).  One can also do a calibration to 
"temperature at 100m depth" or "temperature at 200m depth"; these work almost as well (as judged by the standard deviation of the fits), mainly because SST is highly 
correlated with subsurface temperatures.  Also, since temperature has a seasonal 
cycle, one can get equations for "winter temperature", "summe r temperature", or 
"annual average temperature"; again, these a ll work just about as well.  One could 
also regress against "sea-surface salinity" (SSS) or "productivity"; these don't work as 
well, but they do give calibrations that are better than random.  But SST is highly 
correlated with SSS; 
what is it that foraminife ra are really measuring ?  
1. I recommend that you look at these regressions in this way: in effect we are trying 
to put a number that everybody can understand (e.g. SST) onto data that only 
micropaleontologists or mathematicians understand (e.g. species composition of a 
fossil sample, or factor loadings).  The idea is valid only to the extent that the 
variable you are assigning to the data is in reality  a master variable controlling the 
formation of a fossil assemblage.  There is good reason (i.e., maps of global 
foraminiferal distributions) to believe th at foraminiferal species composition is 
highly correlated with SST (and subsurf ace temperatures which must be highly 
correlated with SST).  So it is reasonable  to derive temperatures from foram 
species data.  It is not so clear whethe r we should make the correlation to winter 
SST, summer SST, or any closely-correlated variant of this theme.  Since 
paleoenvironmental models (e.g. Genera l Circulation Models (GCM) of the 
atmosphere) need to have seasonal SST information to operate, it is reasonable  to 
make the regressions for each season so as to provide the necessary information to 
make the model operate properly.  
2. It is probably not reasonable to take the wint er/summer estimates seriously. 
Relenting a littlefrom this skeptical attitude , we should acknowledge that there are </text>

MAT variant by Pflaumann et al. (2003). Note: discuss distance-weighting of SST 
estimate.  
VI. One of the major current paleoclima tic conundrums: Imbrie-Kipp and planktonic 
oxygen isotope evidence suggest that tropical sea-surface temperatures were not changed 
much during the last glacial maximum. Bu t high-elevation evidence from continental 
environments and islands suggest that the tropics cooled considerably: snow lines on 
tropical mountains were lower, and the vegetation in the tropical mountains indicate a cooler climate. These lines of evidence (and others which have appeared more recently) 
appear to suggest tropical sea surface c ooling where CLIMAP suggests little change. 
What's the problem?  
similar.    
A. One possible &#8220;clue&#8221; to this problem was provided by Prell et al. (1976), who did 
separate factor analyses on core tops and LGM samples and found that the LGM 
samples yielded one more factor than the core top samples. They dubbed this factor 
the &#8220;glacial cool equatorial&#8221; factor. 
similar.    
B. Much later, after being forced to reassess the problem of tropical sea surface 
temperatures, Hostetler and Mix (1999) performed factor analyses on downcore  
samples from the tropics, on the assumption that the modern core top miss out on a significant factor. Using the factors derived from this downcore factor analysis, they 
devised a paleotemperature transfer f unction by regressing modern SST vs. these 
factors. Then they used this new transfer function to estimate tropical LGM SSTs &#8211; 
and they found much cooler LGM SST estimates.

II. Im brie-Kipp m ethod: factor analysis and transfer functions.  
A. This m ethod assum es that there are certain  groupings of species (assem blages) which 
can be identified by linear m ultivariate sta tistics: orthogonal Q-m ode factor analysis, 
and which rem ain coherent over tim e.  It al so assumes that correlations (of at least 
some of these groupings) m aintain consis tent relationships with environm ental 
properties (e.g. surface temperature).  
B.In an oversim plified form , the assem blages can be viewed of as grouping of species.  
Suppose you have three species, and three groupings:  
                     Species 1        Species 2       
Species 3
 
         Group 1            7                 2

         Group 3            2                 2               
6  
    Then each sam ple would be decom posed into linear com binations of groups 1, 2, and 
3.  This obviously has little advantage unless the three groupings follow the 
environm ental factors better than the indivi dual species.  However, if 33 species of 
foram inifera can be reduced to 6 groupings, a significant sim plification has been 
achieved.  But how should you group the species data? Im brie's answer was to use 
linear statistical analysis.

PALEO-ECOLOGICAL TEMPERATURE ESTIMATES  
 
I. Paleo-ecological temperature estimation is based on the em pirical observation that certain 
species of m arine organism s leave fossils on the seafloor that correspond to tem perature 
patterns in oceanic curface waters.  Downco re records seem  to correspond to the known 
glacial/interglacial fluctuations. 
 
 
A. Although this correlation has been known for som e time, in the early days there was 
uncertainty regarding the optim al wa y to use and interpret this data. Ericson  and 
coworkers at Lam ont focussed on devel oping quick m ethods for stratigraphy based 
on a sm all num ber of m arker species (e.g. G. menardii ). This m ethod is still useful 
for developing a prelim inary stratigraphy.  Unfortunately, this m ethod provided 
misleading clim atological inform ation and led to a conflict between Ericson and 
Emiliani. Later, Lidz (1966) showed that complete counts of foram iniferal species 
provided m ore inform ation which was consis tent with the oxygen isotope record of 
glacial/interglacial transitions .

A. The Imbrie-Kipp method (and all other met hods that require completely empirical 
calibration) explicitly assumes that the te mperature responses of the assemblages 
remains constant through time.  But what  happens during genetic evolutionary 
change?  Can species evolve their temperature tolerance in the face of environment 
pressure?  
1. This kind of problem is most serious in continental environments where species 
may not be very mobile; e.g., even if th e environment changes, in the short term 
there may not be any "seed corn" to allow the optimum assemblage to develop, so 
a non-optimum species has some time in which to respond to evolutionary 
pressures before more effi cient competitors arrive.  
2. In marine environments, this problem is mitigated by the great mobility of the 
species; it is generally  very easy for species to migrat e (but remember that in the 
case of foraminifera, "migration" occurs  via ocean currents and eddies) as the 
temperature bands move.  
a. This is not always true however.  How can cold north polar and south polar 
species intermix? (Perhaps by subsurface exchange, although this may be 
difficult.)  
b. One counter-example of this rule is the disappearance of pink-pigmented G. 
ruber  120,000 years ago in the Pacific and I ndian Oceans.  This species existed 
in all of the oceans before that time, a nd is still quite abundant in the Atlantic 
Ocean.  There is nothing obvious about the environmental differences between 
the oceans that could account for the non-occurrence of this species, so it 
appears that simply there is no "seed co rn" for this species in the Pacific and 
Indian Oceans.  Migration of this speci es from the Atlantic is prevented by the 
hostile environment (e.g. cold) of the circumpolar connection between the oceans.   
 
i. This might  even be an example of a time-transgressive  extinction in the 
making....  
3. Even in marine environments, this problem is very serious for very old 
environments because of the extinction of  species; samples that are (say) about 50 
million years old have none of the same species that exist today.  How can you 
calibrate a species that doesn't  exist in the modern ocean?  
a. For foraminifera, this problem becomes significant at about 1-3 million years 
ago.  
B. The Imbrie method has some significant advantages: it is objective and the 
orthogonality of the factors allows one (at least in principle, if not always in practice) 
to "throw away" information that is not relevant to reconstructions of the particular property that we are interested in (e.g., if  some factors respond to salinity or some 
other variable rather than temperature, we can leave them out of the paleotemperature 
regression (e.g., the "gyre margin" assemblage).  But it also has some disadvantages: 
the regression equations have completely arb itrary form: they have no basis in theory.  </text>

E. However, algebraicly, there are an infin ite number of ways to decompose the core top 
data so that it satisfies these equations.  Varimax Q-mode factor analysis is an 
objective method for finding one of these solutions, given a choice of the number of 
factors to be used.  The number of factors is arbitrary , however!.  
G.  Map assemblages.  Can be used to find out how many factors are reasonable (i.e., 
factors that are 'unmappable' are considered to be in the noise).

 Not everyone is entirely happy with this resolution of the problem; it&#8217;s a sort of 
&#8220;closing the barn after the horse has left&#8221; solution (or perhaps a &#8220;tell us what the 
answer is and we will figure out a way to ge t the forams to get that answer&#8221; solution! 
 
We will return to this problem later.
