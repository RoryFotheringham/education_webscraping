1. Pressure is uniform, changing with time 
2. For mass &#61540;m: hb = hu (because dm is allowed to expand against prevailing pressure) 
3. T rise is a function of fuel heating value and mixture composition 
&#61656; e.g. at &#61510; = 1, Tu ~ 700 K, Tb ~ 2800 K 
4. Hence burned gas expands: &#61554;b~ &#188; &#61554;u; &#61540;Vb ~ 4 &#61540;Vu

Combustion produced pressure rise 
5. Since total volume is constrained. The pressure must rise by &#61540;p, and all the 
gas in the cylinder is compressed. 
6. Both the unburned gas ahead of flam e and burned gas behind the flame move 
away from the flame front 
7. Both the unburned gas and burned gas temperatures rise due to the 
compression by the newly burned gas 
8. Unburned gas state: since heat transfer is relatively small, the temperature is 
related to pressure by isentropic relationship

Burn duration 
&#8226; Burn duration as CA-deg. : measure of burn progress
in cycle 
&#8226; For modern fast-burn engines under medium speed,
part load condition: 
&#8211; &#61508;&#61553;0-10% ~ 15o 
&#8211; &#61508;&#61553;0-50% ~ 25o 
&#8211; &#61508;&#61553;0-90% ~ 35o 
&#8226; As engine speed increases,
burn duration as CA-deg. : 
&#8211; Increases because there is less time per CA-deg. 
&#8211; Decreases because combustion is faster due to higher turbulence 
&#61656;Net effect: increases approximately as &#61621;&#61472;rpm0.2

 Optimum Combustion Phasing 
&#8226; Heat release schedule has to phase correctly with piston motion for
optimal work extraction 
&#8226; In SI engines, combustion phasing controlled by spark 
&#8226; Spark too late 
&#8211; heat release occurs far into expansion and work cannot be fully
extracted 
&#8226; Spark too early 
&#8211; Effectively &#8220;lowers&#8221; compression ratio 
&#8211; increased heat transfer losses 
&#8211; Also likely to cause knock 
&#8226; Optimal: Maximum Brake Torque (MBT) timing 
&#8211; MBT spark timing depends on speed, load, EGR, &#61510;, temperature, 
charge motion, &#8230; 
&#8211; Torque curve relatively flat: roughly 5 to 7oCA retard from MBT 
results in 1% loss in torque 
Spark timing effects

          Turbulent Convective Heat Transfer Correlation 
Approach: Use Nusselt- Reynolds number correlations similar to 
those for turbulent pipe or flat plate flows. e.g. In-cylinder: 
hLNu &#61501; &#61501; a(Re) 0.8 
&#61547; 
h = Heat transfer coefficient 
L = Characteristic length (e.g. bore) 
Re= Reynolds number, &#61554;UL/&#61549; 
U = Characteristic gas velocity 
&#61547; = Gas thermal conductivity 
&#61549; = Gas viscosity 
&#61554; = Gas density 
a = Turbulent pipe flow correlation coefficient 
13 
Radiative Heat Transfer 
&#8226; Important in diesels due to presence of hot 
radiating particles (particu late matters) in the flame 
&#8226; Radiation from hot gas relatively small 
&#61478; 4Qrad &#61501; &#61541;&#61655;&#61555;&#61655; Tparticle 
&#61555; = Stefan Boltzman Constant (5.67x10-8 W/m2-K4) 
&#61541; = Emissivity 
where 
Tcyl. ave &lt; Tparticle &lt; Tmax burned gas 
&#8226; Radiation spectrum peaks at &#61548;max 
&#61548;max T = constant ( &#61548;max = 3 &#61549;m at 1000K) 
Typically, in diesels: Q &#61627; 0.2Q (cycle cum) rad total

 Heat Transfer Summary 
1. Magnitude of heat transfer from the burned gas much greater than in 
any phase of cycle 
2. Heat transfer is a significant performance loss and affects engine 
operation 
&#61656;Loss of available energy 
&#61656;Volumetric efficiency loss 
&#61656;Effect on knock in SI engine 
&#61656;Effect on mixture preparation in SI engine cold start 
&#61656;Effect on diesel engine cold start 
3. Convective heat transfer depends on gas temperature, heat transfer 
coefficient, which depends on charge motion, and transfer area, 
which depends on flame/combustion chamber geometry 
4. Radiative heat transfer is smaller than convective one, and it is only 
significant in diesel engines

 Engine Heat Transfer: Impact 
&#8226; Efficiency and Power: Heat transfer in the in let decrease volumetric 
efficiency. In the cylinder, heat losses to the wall is a loss of 
availability. 
&#8226; Exhaust temperature : Heat losses to exhaust influence the 
turbocharger performance. In- c ylinder and exhaust system heat 
transfer has impact on catalyst light up. 
&#8226; Friction: Heat transfer governs liner, piston/ ring, and oil temperatures. It also affects pist on and bore distortion. All of these 
effects influence friction. Thermal loading determined fan, oil and 
water cooler capacities and pumping power. 
&#8226; Component design: The operating temperatures of critical engine components affects their durability; e.g. via mechanical stress,

Engine Heat Transfer: Impact 
&#8226; Mixture preparation in SI engines: Heat transfer to the fuel 
significantly affect fuel evapor ation and cold start calibration 
&#8226; Cold start of diesel engines: The compression ratio of diesel 
engines are often governed by cold start requirement 
&#8226; SI engine octane requirement: Heat transfer influences inlet 
mixture temperature, chamber, cylinder head, liner, piston and 
valve temperatures, and therefor e end-gas temperatures, which 
affect knock. Heat transfer also affects build up of in-cylinder deposit which affects knock.

 Ignition and Flame Development Process 
1. Spark discharge creates a high temperature plasma kernel 
which expands rapidly (1mm, 100 &#61549;s). 
2. The hot reactive gas at the outer edge of this kernel causes the 
adjacent fuel-air mixture to ignite, creating an outward 
propagating flame which is almost spherical. 
3. As the flame grows larger, the fl ame surface is distorted by the 
turbulence of the fluid motion. A wrinkled laminar flame results. 
4. Because of the significant surface area enhancement by the 
wrinkling, the locally laminar &#8220;turbulent&#8221; flame burns rapidly.

SI Engine Knock 
1. Knock is most critical at WOT and at low speed because of its 
persistence and potential for damage. Part-throttle knock is a 
transient phenomenon and is a nuisance to the driver. 
2. Whether or not knock occurs depends on engine/fuel/vehicle factors and ambient conditions (temperature, humidity). This 
makes it a complex phenomenon. 
3. To avoid knock with gasoline, the engine compression ratio is limited to approximately 12.5 in PFI engines and 13.5 in DISI
engines. Significant efficiency gains are possible if the compression ratio could be rais ed. (Approximately, increasing 
CR by 1 increases efficiency by one percentage point.) 
4. Feedback control of spark timing using a knock sensor is used so that SI engine can operate close to its knock limit.

Knock Fundamentals 
Knock originates in the extremely rapid release of much of the fuel 
chemical energy contained in the end-gas of the propagating 
turbulent flame, resulting in high local pressures. The non-
uniform pressure distribution causes strong pressure waves or 
shock waves to propagate across and excites the acoustic modes 
of the combustion chamber. 
When the fuel-air mixture in the end-gas region is compressed to 
sufficiently high pressures and temperatures , the fuel oxidation 
process &#8213; starting with the pre-flame chemistry and ending with 
rapid heat release &#8213; can occur spontaneously in parts or all of the 
end-gas region. 
Most evidence indicates that knock originates with the auto -
ignition of one or more local regions within the end-gas. Additional regions then ignite until the end-gas is essentially fully reacted. The sequence of processes occur extremely rapidly.

 FUEL FACTORS 
&#8226; The auto-ignition process depends on the fuel
chemistry. 
&#8226; Practical fuels are blends of a large numberof individual hydrocarbon compounds, eachof which has its own chemical behavior. 
&#8226; A practical measure of a fuel&#8217;s resistance to
knock is the octane number. High octanenumber fuels are more resistant to knock.

FEATURES OF DIESEL COMBUSTION 
&#8226; Ignition delay 
&#8211; Auto-ignition in different parts of combustion chamber 
&#8226; After ignition, fuel sprays into hot burned gas 
&#8211; Then, evaporation process is fast 
&#8226; Major part of combustion controlled by fuel air mixing process 
&#8211; Mixing dominated by flow field formed by fuel jet interacting with 
combustion chamber walls during injection 
&#8226; Highly luminous flame: 
&#8211; Substantial soot formation in the f uel rich zone by pyrolysis, followed 
by substantial subsequent oxidation

DIESEL COMBUSTION PROCESS 
PROCESS 
&#8226; Liquid fuel injected into compressed charge 
&#8226; Fuel evaporates and mixes with the hot air 
&#8226; Auto-ignition with the rapid burning of the fuel-
air that is &#8220;premixed&#8221; during the ignition delay period 
&#8211; Premixed burning is fuel rich 
&#8226; As more fuel is injected, the combustion is controlled by the rate of diffusion of air into the flame

 Diesel as the Most Efficient Power Plant 
&#8226; Theoretically, for the same CR, SI engine has higher &#61544;f; but 
diesel is not limited by knock, therefore it can operate at 
higher CR and achieves higher &#61544;f 
&#8226; Not throttled - small pumping loss 
&#8226; Overall lean - higher value of &#61543; - higher thermodynamic 
efficiency 
&#8226; Can operate at low rpm - applicable to very large engines 
&#8211; slow speed, plenty of time for combustion 
&#8211; small surface to volume ratio: lower percentage of parasitic losses (heat transfer and friction) 
&#8226; Opted for turbo-charging: higher energy density 
&#8211; Reduced parasitic losses (friction and heat transfer) relative to output 
Large Diesels: &#61544;f~ 55% 
~ 98% ideal efficiency ! 
Diesel Engine Characteristics 
(compared to SI engines) 
&#8226; Better fuel economy 
&#8211; Overall lean, thermodynamically efficient 
&#8211; Large displacement, low speed &#8211; lower FMEP 
&#8211; Higher CR 
&gt; CR limited by peak pressure, NOx emissions, combustion and 
heat transfer loss 
&#8211; Turbo-charging not limited by knock: higher BMEP over domain of 
operation, lower relative losses (friction and heat transfer) 
&#8226; Lower Power density 
&#8211; Overall lean: would lead to smaller BMEP 
&#8211; Turbocharged: would lead to higher BMEP 
&gt; not knock limited, but NOx limited 
&gt; BMEP higher than natura lly aspirated SI engine 
&#8211; Lower speed: overall power density (P/VD) not as high as SI engines 
&#8226; Emissions: more problematic than SI engine 
&#8211; NOx: needs development of efficient catalyst 
&#8211; PM: regenerative and continuous traps

Factors affecting fuel  conversion efficiency 
These ideal engine cycle analysis  results show that expansion 
ratio rc and gas composition (through &#61543; the ratio of specific 
heats) both affect the cycle&#8217;s fu el conversion efficiency because: 
1. The expansion ratio (which may or may not equal to the compression ratio) determines how much work is extracted over the expansion stroke. 
2. The higher the value of &#61543; the more the temperature falls 
during expansion, the larger the energy change and hence the larger the expansion stroke work. 
3. The compression stroke work is of order one-sixth of the 
expansion stroke work so expansion stroke work effects dominate.

The Hydrogen problem: 
Fundamentally H2 is the only feasible fuel in the 
foreseeable future 
&#8226; Strictly, hydrogen is not a &#8220;fuel&#8221;, but an energy 
storage medium 
&#8211; Difficulty in hydrogen storage 
&#8211; Difficulty in hydrogen supply infra structure 
&#8226; Hydrogen from fossil fuel is not an efficient 
energy option 
&#8226; Environmental resistance for nuclear and hydroelectric options

The hydrogen problem: 
H2 from reforming petroleum fuel 
Hydrocarbon Air 
Air H2 
CO 
H2O H2 
CO2 Electricity 
N2,CO2 Catalyst Fuel Cell Catalyst 
Note: HC to H2/CO process is exothermic; 
energy loss ~20% and needs to cool stream 
(Methanol reforming process  is energy neutral, but 
energy loss is similar when i t is made from fossil fuel) 
Current best reformer efficiency is ~70% 
Problems: 
CO poisoning of anode 
Sulfur poisoning 
Anode poisoning requires S&lt;1ppm

Fuel cell outlook 
&#8226; Too many barriers 
&#8211; Cost: unlikely to come down because of price of precious metal 
&#8211; System complexity

Fuel-air cycle results 
In the Fuel-Air Cycle, the engine processes are still modeled as ideal 
but the properties of the working fl uid (fuel/air/residual gas mixture 
before combustion, and burned gases in chemical equilibrium after 
combustion) are described accurately. 
The results from this improved cy cle analysis model are useful for 
estimating, approximately, the effect s of compression ratio, fuel/air 
equivalence ratio, and mixture inlet conditions on engine efficiency and 
performance. The following approxim ate relationships are useful. 
1. The maximum indicated fuel conver sion efficiency of an actual engine is 
about 0.85 times the efficiency of the equivalent fuel-air cycle. 
2. Results from change of engine operating condition can be interpreted in 
terms of percentage c hange in output values 
Computer codes which accurately simulate the real engine cycle have 
now been developed and are widely used.

 Lubricants 
&#8226; Viscosity is a strong function of temperature 
&#8226; Multi-grade oils (introduced in the 1950&#8217;s) 
&#8211; Temperature sensitive polymers to stabilize 
viscosity at high temperatures 
&#61656;Cold: polymers coiled and inactive 
&#61656;Hot: polymers uncoiled and tangle-up: 
suppress high temperature thinning 
&#8226; Stress sensitivity: viscosity is a function of 
strain rate 
Viscosity 
10W30 refers to upper viscosity limit equal to single grade SAE 10 at 0 deg F (-18C) 
and lower viscosity limit equal to SAE single grade 30 at 100 C.

          <text>Super- and Turbo- Charging 
Purpose: To increas e the charge density 
&#8226; Supercharge: compressor powered by engine output 
&#8211; No turbo-lag 
&#8211; Does not impact exhaust treatment 
&#8211; Less efficient than turbo-charging 
&#8226; Turbo-charge: compressor powered by exhaust turbine 
&#8211; More directly utilize exhaust energy 
&#8211; Turbo- lag problem 
&#8211; Affects exhaust treatment 
&#8226; Intercooler 
&#8211; Increase charge density (hence output power) by cooling the 
charge 
&#8211; Lowers NOx emissions 
&#8211; Suppresses knock 
Additional benefit of turbo-charging 
&#8226; Can downsize engine while retaining same 
max power 
&#8211; Less throttle loss under part load in SI engine 
&#8226; Higher BMEP reduces relative friction and heat transfer losses

Diesel Emissions Reduction 
1. Fuel injection: higher injection pressure; multiple 
pulses per cycle, injecti on rate shaping; improved 
injection timing control 
2. Combustion chamber geometry and air motion 
optimization well matched to fuel injection system 
3. Exhaust Gas Recycle (EGR) for NOx control 
&#61656;Cooled for impact 
4. Reduced oil consumption to reduce HC contribution 
to particulates 
5. Exhaust treatment technology: NOx, PM 
6. Cleaner fuels

1. Precise metering of fuel into cylinder 
&#8211; Engine calibration benefit: better driveability and 
emissions 
2. Opportunity of running stratified lean at part load 
&#8211; Fuel economy benefit (reduced pumping work; lower charge temperature, lower heat transfer; better thermodynamic efficiency) 
3. Charge cooling by fuel evaporation 
&#8211; Gain in volumetric efficiency 
&#8211; Gain in knock margin (could then raise compression ratio for better fuel economy)

DISI Challenges 
1. High cost 
2. With the part-load stratified-charge concept : 
&#8211; High hydrocarbon emissions at light load 
&#8211; Significant NOx emission, and lean exhaust not amenable to
3-way catalyst operation 
3. Particulate emissions at high load 
4. Liquid gasoline impinging on combustion chamber walls 
&#8211; Hydrocarbon source 
&#8211; Lubrication problem 
5. Injector deposit 
&#8211; Special fuel additive needed for injector cleaning 
6. Cold start behavior 
&#8211; Insufficient fuel injection pressure 
&#8211; Wall wetting

Reverse Blow-down Flow 
&#8226; IVO to EVC: 
&#8211; Burned gas flows from exhaust port because Pe&gt;Pi 
&#8226; EVC to Pc = Pi: 
&#8211; Burned gas flows from cylinder into intake system until cylind er and 
intake pressure equalize 
Forward Flow 
&#8226; Pc = Pi to BC: 
&#8211; Forward flow from intake syst em to cylinder induced by downwar d piston 
motion 
Reverse Displacement Flow 
&#8226; BC to IVC: 
&#8211; Fuel, air and residual gas mixture flows from cylinder into in take due to 
upward piston motion 
Note that the reverse flow affects the mixture preparation

          <text>Bio-fuel combustion properties 
&#8226; Bio-diesels and ethanol are fundamentally clean and 
attractive fuels to be used in engines 
&#8226; The use of these fuels as  supplements to petroleum 
base fuel are compatible with current engine configuration and fuel infra-structure 
&#8226; Practical issues can be adequately handled by engineering 
&#8211; Fuel quality 
&#8211; Engine calibration 
&#8211; Materials compatibility, viscosity, &#8230; 
Burning the fuel is the  least of the problem !!!

&#8226; Transportation/mobility is vital to 
modern economy 
&#8211; Transport of People 
&#8211; Transport of goods and produce 
&#8226; People get accustomed to the ability to travel 
3 
Transportation needs special kind of energy source 
&#8226; Vehicles need to carry source of energy on 
board 
&#8226; Hydrocarbons are unparalleled in terms of energy density 
&#8211; For example, look at refueling of gasoline 
&#8226; ~40 Liters in 2 minutes (~0.25 Kg/sec) 
&#8211; Corresponding energy flow 
= 0.25 Kg/sec x 44 MJ/Kg 
= 11 Mega Watts

 Notes: 
Lecture 1: Introduction to ICE 
Vocabulary
Engine : Device to convert fuel energy to mechanical energy 
&#8213; Fuel energy to thermal energy by combustion 
&#8213; Thermal energy to mechanical energy by expansion 
Internal combustion: combustion takes place in working fluid 
External combustion: combustion occurs externally; energy  coupled to working fluid by heat transfer device 
Open cycle: working fluid discharged to atmosphere; e.g. all ICE Close cycle: working fluid recycled through engine; e.g. steam engine with condenser 
ICE 
Size: displacement volume 1cc to 1m
3 per cylinder; comment on why it is difficult to build engine outside this 
range. 
Power: 10 W to 108 W per cylinder 
Applications: Automotive, marine, pow er generation, mechanical devices 
Classification: 
&#8213; by application: Car, Truck, Marine, Rail, Stationary generation, &#8230; 
&#8213; by basic engine design: reciprocating, rotary, in-line block, V-block, radial, oppose piston, pre-/open chamber 
&#8213; by working cycle: 2-stroke, 4-stroke, naturally aspir ated , turbo-charged, super-charged, turbo-compound 
&#8213; by fuel: gasoline, diesel, alcohol, natural gas, &#8230; 
&#8213; by mixture preparation: carbureted, fuel injection 
&#8213; by ignition: spark ignited, compression ignited 
History 
Circa Event People and key concept 
1860 Rudimentary ICE Jean J. Lenoir. 
&#8213; Key concept: Combustion increases temperature and gas 
expands. Expanding gas drives piston to produce mechanical energy. 
&#8213; Modified steam energy; no compression 
&#8213; Operated at 10 cycles/min; efficiency &lt;5% because of low effective compression ratio 
Sold 500 of them 
1867 Atmospheric free piston engine Nicolaus Otto and Eugene Langen 
&#8213; Key concept: still no compression, but use the inertia of a 
heavy piston to over-expand the combustion gas to below 
atmosphere, thereby increasing the expansion ratio.  Output mechanical work stored as gravitational potential energy in heavy piston first, and then extracted by clutching piston to fly wheel on downward stroke. 
&#8213; Larger expansion ratio: efficiency increased to 11% 
&#8213; Operate at 28 cycles/minute 
&#8213; Used a flame ignitor through a sliding window 
Sold 5000, dominated market for 10 years until introduction of the 4-stroke engine 
1876 4-stroke engine Nicolaus Otto 
1878 2-stroke engine Dougald Clerk 
1892 Compression Ignition 4-stroke Rudolf Diesel 
&#8213; Key concepts: prevent the very rapid and high pressure heat

  process via introducing fuel late in the cycle; compression 
ignition 
&#8213; Concept developed by the company MAN 
&#8213; Diesel was in heavy debt, and jumped off a ship. 
1870&#8217;s Development of the Petroleum 
Industry 
1900&#8217;s Spark plug dominated the market of 
ignition devices Spark plug was invented by Edmond Berger in 1839. Albert 
Champion was the most successful manufacturer. 
1920&#8217;s ICE dominated the market of 
automotive power plant Main reason for not using the steam engine for vehicles was that 
too much water was needed. 
1920&#8217;s Tetra-ethyl lead as anti-knock agent Thomas Midgl ey, under the direction of Carles Kettering at GM 
found the compound to suppress knock after extensive search.  With leaded gasoline, maximu m compression ratio was raised 
from 5 to 9, and engine effi ciency increased substantially 
1920-1960 Steady development 
1960&#8217;s Vehicle emissions became an issue Smog mechanism was discovered by Haagen Smit 
1970&#8217;s Oil embargo; energy crisis 
1980&#8217;s Start of global competition 
1980&#8217;s Catalytic converter and unleaded 
gasoline The 3 way catalyst reduced emissions of CO, HC and NOx by more than an order of magnitude, and was the enabler for the vehicles to meet emissions regulations 
1990&#8217;s  Recognition of importance of green 
house gas 
2000&#8217;s Towards sustainable transportation 
Gas exchange process of 4- and 2-stroke engines 
See figures 1-2 and 1-3. 
&#8213; 2-stroke engine theoretically has twice the power density of 2-stroke engine; in practice, the ratio is about 1.4 
(value larger for low speed turbo-charger engi nes) because of incompleteness of scavenging. 
&#8213; For effective scavenging of the 2-stroke, there will be excess air in the exhaust, and the 3-way catalyst would 
not work.  Therefore 2-stroke SI engine would not be able to meet the stringent emission regulations 
Engine pressure traces 
See Fig. 1.8 and 1.15 for SI and Compression Ignition engines 
&#8213; Pressure measurement is an important diagnostic because it is directly related to the mechanical energy output 
of the engine (Torque = P dV/d &#61553;, where &#61553; is the crank angle); furthermore, interpretation of pressure is 
unambiguous since it is uniform in the cylinder (e xcept in knocking), whereas temperature is not. 
&#8213; Empirically for most efficient operation, peak pressure for SI engine is at 14-17
o CA-ATC; for diesel is at 7-10o 
CA-ATC. 
&#8213; The very rapid pressure rise in the beginning of  diesel combustion is the cause of the diesel noise.
