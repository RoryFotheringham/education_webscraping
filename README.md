The general idea is to use open source courses (e.g https://ocw.mit.edu/search/) and index them.
The search part will allow users to search for key topics (e.g TFIDF), and the search engine will return all courses, (potentially including the slide numbers and lecture timings?) of when the topic is mentioned. This should of course generalise to more than just single word searches (e.g ranking in search engines) should bring up slides within courses relating to ranking methods used in search engines.
